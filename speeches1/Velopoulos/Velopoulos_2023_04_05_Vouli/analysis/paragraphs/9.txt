2 things the people and the people who are looking for laws and sausages should not see. You are not capable of making sausages, but you make laws for unconviction and for the persecution of opponents. And I ask this, what kind of government does any government have in the country, Mr. Pleyris, when the independent authorities have the power of attrition, that is, you appoint an independent authority and it can choose water pricing policy.  In the stream I now say anywhere, but it is not controlled by anyone. That is, what is a parallel state, a parallel government in the state law elected by the deputies, the citizens to be heard by the Greek people, the independent authorities is a parallel state.  Probably not.
