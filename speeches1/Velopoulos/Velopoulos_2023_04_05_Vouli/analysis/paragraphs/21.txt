You keep legislating polygamy in a country where under SYRIZA they brought 25 bills for the Ministry of Justice and under the new democracy about 9. Do you know what Lao Tzu used to say. For polygamy The more the laws proliferate, the more the illegal ones proliferate. That's what you do. That's why the problem cannot be solved at last, and for me, as Roydis said. A solution, Mr. Plevris, exists in the legal, a law is required which mandates. Anyone who orders anyone who legislates to have the same obligations as the person to whom the law actually applies cannot be unpunishable for anyone in this country it is illegal, it is unconstitutional, it is shameful, it is offensive to democracy. So when I become government, we will make rules just one law to apply the laws in all directions and for all individuals from political bankers, doctors, committees, independent authorities, law enforcement. This is a solution.
