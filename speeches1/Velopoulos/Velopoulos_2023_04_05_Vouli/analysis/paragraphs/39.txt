Especially for PASOK and New Democracy, Mr. Plevris, you do not have the moral advantage.  You do this you owe 400 million euros, you can't waste the money of the Greek people, the Greek solution proposed that the money you waste here and there should be put into a fund to help the homeless poor Greeks.  Stop the election period with luxury and opulence we have no money as Greeks let's give it there at least why to waste it on supposedly election rallies and events.  Give them there and all the channels.You turn on the TV in the morning and you see Adonis Georgiades, the candidate of New Democracy, New Democracy MPs, ministers, the Prime Minister, we don't see a Greek solution, there is no Greek solution, they pass us by anyway, they pass us by as soon as they arrive from where it's over.
