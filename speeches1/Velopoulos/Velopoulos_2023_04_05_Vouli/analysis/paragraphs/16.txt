Posting on the webspace of the term incredible things to deprive bread from a man this man.  I tell him this, because he probably doesn't believe in God either. May God forgive Velopoulos, Mr. Koutrumano, he will never forgive you.  I'll chase you with legality as long as it takes and the bread is close at hand because this gentleman has expired his term of office is keeping him illegal.  The government's expansive interpretation of the law, the government's usual expansive interpretation, that is, half a minute his term of office is over he is paid, in violation of the law this gentleman and decides on the media, we will not say about his decisions. 2 million fine I alone paid 2 million now. No one else.
