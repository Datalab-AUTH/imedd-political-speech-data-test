Nikos Alivisatos daily.  Is this the ideal period for an ambitious redefinition of Greek-Turkish relations for an Aegean agreement? The whole story the day after the elections is this statement by Mrs Bakoyannis.  Statements by Mr. Katrougalos' friend, a statement by Mr. Katrougalos that speak clearly about the problem we have with Turkey to lead to exploitation. And the statement of Mrs Bakoyannis honours us very much, we do not cooperate with Velopoulos because we disagree on national issues and it refers to exploitation.  I say this, finish model of Prespes agreement with Turkey for exploitation Katrougalos, Turkey has rights in the Aegean Venizelos, the Aegean is not a Greek lake Turkey has rights.  Voridis, there is a possibility of negotiations and co-exploitation of the Aegean Papadimitriou, there is nothing wrong with exploitation Kairidis, Turkey as a coastal state in the Aegean and the Mediterranean has rights. Dokos, Greece could marry her a deal in their exploitation. That's the point, that's why the oligarchs are pushing the system to connect the 3 aces to rule because this history of exploitation has to end after the elections.  Anyone who wants to make the exploitation to make the property, his own, not the 500 billion euros that belong to the Greek people from the many energy companies he has, according to Professor Selidis. And here comes the other crime, which we have to talk about at some point and I'll close.
