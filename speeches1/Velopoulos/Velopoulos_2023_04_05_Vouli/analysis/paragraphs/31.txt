 You have created a North Korean state, Mr.Plevris, control of justice, silencing of opponents, manipulation of people through the mass media, repression, parastatal mechanisms, night, goons, as the late Harry Clynn used to say, organized crime has different names around the world, Mr.Plevris, in Italy it's called Camorra, in America it's called mafia and in Greece unfortunately it's called government. With what you're doing with what you're doing, because there is no democracy the way you're treating this state that you all have created, I'll say it straight out. Withhold, we will abolish this withholding state, we will re-establish it.  As Karamanlis II said.  But we do it in practice. For among us there are no nightmares, nor are there people who are in league with oligarchs, canal owners and shipowners.
