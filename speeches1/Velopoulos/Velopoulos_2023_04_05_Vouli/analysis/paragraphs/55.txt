You don't care about the Greeks themselves will vote.  Yes, the will of the Greek people is not your concern.  They are not only concerned with power and the plundering of public property. Because they can't govern themselves, they don't have a programme, because this country seems to be a disaster, because all they care about is the chairs, because they don't disagree on the major issues, they are already in government.  SYRIZA has already voted for 50% of the bills of New Democracy.  The same PASOK voted for 80, they already voted together to cut pensions, confiscate property, sell off PPC, DEA and airports and ports.
