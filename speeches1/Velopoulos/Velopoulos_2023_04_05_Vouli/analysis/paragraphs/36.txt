 You understand, you have the power of my vote, the New Republic, SYRIZA, PASOK did not write off debts, they did not write off loans, they did not write off taxes, they did not, they inflated the problem and now as the opposition on the one hand they come and denounce the other. And tomorrow whatever later they become opposition will be for the next.  What do we say we write off ALL debts, as the New Democracy did to its friends, friends and cronies.  We will do it to the citizens and it must be done.
