The tragedy that became a sacrifice. The tragedy that became an opportunity, mercy and mercy, we mourned people, some say opportunity, others say sacrifice, opportunity as if it's a damn thing. These are incredible things, of course, and I should say here that SYRIZA was saying the same thing with Mr.Xantho, who is the voice of SYRIZA in the context of good neighbourliness with New Democracy, saying that it is an opportunity for reflection, the tragedy at Mati, so we will take a philosophical approach together with a Confucius and a Gandhi, and we will all discuss Socrates and Plato together.  We will reflect on what was to blame for Mati, what was to blame for Tempe.
