 Greece Serbia alliance what Constantine Karamanlis I and Andreas Papandreou B and all the prime ministers until yesterday were saying is still valid and now shame, shame, neither Tsipras speaks, nor Androulakis Nothing. And so I appeal to the voters. In the next election, you see me and you vote for SYRIZA to the EU and you will get Mitsotakis. You who vote for a new democracy, add and you will get Tsipras, you who vote for Androulakis, be careful, it can happen to both of them. This is the reality.  The tripartite is cooking, it's coming and I'll tell you one last thing.
