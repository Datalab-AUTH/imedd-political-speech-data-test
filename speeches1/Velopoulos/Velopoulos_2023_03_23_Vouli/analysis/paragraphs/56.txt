Why do SYRIZA PASOK and New Democracy, a government that rabidly stays in power in a bankrupt country, react like this? Still eating or afraid of prison. Let's choose what you want in the new democracy in PASOK and SYRIZA for this country is a bankrupt country.  They flattened it with your choices of privatization of infrastructure, public goods, health care and here I call on the Greek citizens, the voters who vote for other parties to demand that their parties tell them what they will do with the privatization of infrastructure, public goods, health care, the energy stock exchange, the bank, bankruptcy of private individuals. Haircuts on banks and Hercules debts, corruption, black marketeers and commit to pre-election.  Now what are we going to do if they tell us No, if SYRIZA tells us.  Listen now we have done it in writing and now SYRIZA is telling us that it is bad What makes the goals.  The Mr. smoker from earlier will drive us crazy in here she even think she's political or we have dementia.  PASOK made the fans to be able to buy 9% of the red loan PASOK came the others came, they expanded it, I make it better, they implement this.
