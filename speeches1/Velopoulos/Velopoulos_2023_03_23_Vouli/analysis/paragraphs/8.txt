We learned forgiveness, forgiveness, forgot forgiveness, forgot forgiveness, didn't see forgiveness, didn't know forgiveness, didn't hear forgiveness, and forgiveness without repentance, even the priest of our parish does not accept. And repentance means giving up politics once and for all, because young children were sacrificed in Tempe. This means repentance.
