What a state you have created. Mr Koutroumano's term of office expired in November.  Neither SYRIZA is complaining nor PASOK has expired their term of office.  It is as if Greece does not exist.  Our country has no national broadcasting council must go.  Nobody talks about anybody for the 3 of them appointed themselves. They're keeping him there. But listen for the hold.
