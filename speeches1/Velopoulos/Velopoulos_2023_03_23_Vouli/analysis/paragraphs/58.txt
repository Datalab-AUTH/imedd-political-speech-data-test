The energy policy continues, because otherwise the charge of kilowatt-hour for the month of March was unchanged in the month of March, but the price of electricity in our country does not fall.  The price of natural gas has not fallen, i.e. it is falling internationally, but in Greece the price remains the same and stable. In January it was 70 € NOW it is 50 € in February, but we still pay the same money.  Prices unchanged who is stealing this money.  Who, Minister, is stealing this money?  The energy providers, your best friend you gave them immunity and they are ruining the Greek, same with oil.  The barrel is falling internationally, bardinoyannis and Latsis here are making billions, two and a half billion in profits in one year, two and a half billion for both people. And Mrs Bakoyannis says, we taxed by 10, 15, 20%.  The two and a half billion but 70 80 they said they will take Vardinoyannis so and above all to Vardinoyannis 70 and 80 and 90 I see you not even 90 minutes sitting your chair you will all go together in 90 minutes you will manage.
