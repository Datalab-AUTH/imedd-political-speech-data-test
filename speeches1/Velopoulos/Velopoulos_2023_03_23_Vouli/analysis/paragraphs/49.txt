 I know ministers, MPs who have been here for 30 years, state-owned, most of them.  That's their profession, it's bubbling up in the bureaucratic elementary to go from the morning because come to my business to give you a thousand each. That's how much it costs to work here Some people never set foot What a thousand dollars or a thousand dollars to pay and pay themselves. Let's go to investments, Minister, that Latsis fillet that you gave, Minister, what happened the day before yesterday?  I was passing by I could see the one skyscraper was on the thirty-second floor.  Still waiting to go to the fifty-second and something fillets are cut I went inside I saw fillets cut plots of land become plots of land at a bargain price Whoever wants it gets it if he has money the rich man. You good things about.
