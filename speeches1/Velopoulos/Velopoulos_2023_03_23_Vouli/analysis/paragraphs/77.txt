 Don't be obedient to what you are told, Don't believe the channels Greeks and Greeks.  And as the great Quintinus wrote, I don't blame those who exercise power, but those who are willing to obey even their lies, so they will be involved and they will be Greeks.  Let's reelect them. Let's also go to the parastate that the new democracy has created, controlling the judiciary, controlling the media, leading the country into tyranny.  They are regular power brokers and I will tell you this.
