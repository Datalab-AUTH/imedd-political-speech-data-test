One port in Igoumenitsa sold off. A strategic port for which really 2 months before you go to elections and need everything because it has the right without elections.  Let the Greek people decide to elect a term, I say, you coward. Elect the Greek solution of SYRIZA PASOK and decide the next government.  You have a month and a half before the elections that you are selling off the port without returning the land area without investment, writing the local community in your old, old shoes.  By what right.
