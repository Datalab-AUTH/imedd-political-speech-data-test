Why no one talks about the helenic train. No one is talking about the company, neither SYRIZA is talking about the company, nor Tsipras.  I call Androulakis, we said he's looking to find a way to co-govern now from here he'll go from there he'll go from there, he's confused, he's at a crossroads and incumbents and he's looking to go right from left to go in the middle where to go so this proves he can't govern anyway.  So let the voters understand that they can't and they don't have it and they don't want it. Let's go on, because we are only talking about the Tempe yesterday I was reading a notice official people's minefield engineers of the OSE, the route Thessaloniki-Eidomeni minefield the route Thessaloniki-Eidomeni if something will be done tomorrow I did not know what the minister would say I did not know what the other would say and what bothers me most is that neither SYRIZA nor PASOK are targeting the minister responsible Mr Karagiannis is responsible for infrastructure.  This incredible, invisible press.
