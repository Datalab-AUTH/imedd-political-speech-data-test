This justice, the evil justice, the justice that decides on the appointed and the children must learn from the ministers and Prime Minister A that the lawlessness and make the Prime Minister whoever Prime Minister, the justice appointed and appointed are their friends, will not punish them. But if the father of a child steals 1000 € or commits a tax evasion slip of 3000 €. They're gonna put him in jail. How fair is this system? How serious is this state.
