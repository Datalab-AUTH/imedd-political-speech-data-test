Choose which one you want so that we know who we have to deal with We know the Greek people don't know and that worries me, because the 25 26% insist on dragging you to vote. On the other hand I will say it. To understand it. Who is to blame. Today for the Greek Prime Minister It's Mr Tsipras' fault. For the Eye for Mr. Tsipras, Mitsotakis said the New Democracy. Mr Tsipras said it was made by the joints of power. You know, the joints between the bricks there is the joint, the bricks now if it means one side and brick the other and the joints of power is one thing, it's another thing, but the joints of power were made by you from PASOK, New Democracy and Syriza to the Prime Minister who blames the Deep State most deep state of his own appointed to democrats to hospital administrations, to independent authorities, to secretaries general, to any in front of me do not go, he is a democrat, this is the deep state. This is the principle of power, that is, in essence they both say that they are not to blame, but these are the actions of the same make sense and conclude, I can't maybe t can make out I can't follow.
