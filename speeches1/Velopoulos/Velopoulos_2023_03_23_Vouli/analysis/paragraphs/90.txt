 The truth is that when the light comes out it seems to be too small and too short for the light of Greece.  We insist on a Greece that is a beacon of Greek culture. We insist for a different Greece, a strong, self-reliant Greece of global civilization.  We insist on a Greece that loves Greeks and Greek women.  We insist on a Greece that will work, toil and produce.  It will finally break the chains of the subservient process that brought all 3 of them together and led it to the bottom of the world economy.  We can do it, we can fix it, we can make Greece self-reliant.  We can make it a power with a vote for the Greek solution in the next elections. Thank you very much. I, too, thank you, Mr. President.
