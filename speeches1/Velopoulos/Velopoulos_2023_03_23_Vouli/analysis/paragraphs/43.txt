You do not see the transport.  I tell you poverty and despair with the lies you tell poverty and despair there is poverty and despair outside and anger and anger and I will tell you what Rousseau said when the people will have nothing to eat anymore.  He knows what he's going to eat, Mr. Staikura. He said I live for the rich. The rich will go, will go out into the streets and eat the world to each other. And the social peace and tranquillity that is a necessary condition of a favourable state will be wasted. We warn you.
