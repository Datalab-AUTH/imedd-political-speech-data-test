And I say idiosyncratic, because we see a fearful prime minister announcing elections on television. He's the TV Prime Minister of the last 50 years.  Proclamations, proclamations, orders, apologies, apologies again from a man who has understood that he is Prime Minister of the country and leader of a party and must speak in the Greek parliament. It's been more than 20 days and still neither Tsipras nor the Prime Minister has shown up here.  Specifically on the issue of temps.
