Tell me what you left to the Greek public sector.  What is left in the Greek State.  At last I can tell you that the ministers of the New Democracy, who are paid by the state but hate the Greek state, hate the state. It's called a phallus, you can't suckle from a state for 20 years of your life or 30.
