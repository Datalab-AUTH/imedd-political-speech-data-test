Let's better go play a comedy Mr Theodorakis, because he has raped our reasoning enough, especially with the shameful Prespa agreement that if it wasn't for him and his ilk would not have passed. The Greek Prime Minister comes out and what does he say, Mr Staikoura? I'll call, says the Italians now and tell them we will not give us crippled trains that is, what tells us 4 years of the line before creator.  The wrecks that the Greek solution denounced and Mr. Viliardos and I were saying here that they are wrecks, we sent these trains away, the Swiss didn't want them and sent them here, the Italians will now call them. It really is aimed at people of limited perception.
