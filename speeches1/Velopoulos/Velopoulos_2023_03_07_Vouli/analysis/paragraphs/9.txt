 They stopped the searches for 15 minutes for each leader.  Why? You have reached the extreme point of instrumentalising even elections to cover up the lost lives of our children.  You are playing with the dates of the elections as you have been playing with Greece and the institutions for 4 years.  The Greece you have made is killing its children.  We will either burn, or drown, or our children will be torn to pieces in the streets.  Now go to elections. "Go where it goes" has become a national motto.  We live in the land of sloppiness, of no boredom and God bless.
