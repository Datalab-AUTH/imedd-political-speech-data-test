 You know.  But of course you know, the letter - a letter of mockery to the management of OSE on 27/4/2022, in which the chairman of the maintenance committee of the TRAINOSE network complains about mismanagement, lack of maintenance, zero safety, non-functioning of the light markings.  You know.  But of course you know about the letter sent by the Panhellenic Union of Traction Personnel on 1/11/2022, addressed to OSE, the Minister of Infrastructure & Transport, the Railway Regulatory Authority and HELLENIC TRAIN, regarding the poor state of the railway infrastructure, the lack of maintenance, the non-operation of the light signals and the telecommand system, the non-operation of the ETCS (EUROPEAN TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM). You know.  But of course you know about the trade unionists' statement of 7/2/2023 which says all this simply and clearly.
