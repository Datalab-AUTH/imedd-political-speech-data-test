 Some trees at the sailor's house were planted there to justify the donations.  If something happens, we'll have the same thing again.  And don't say you didn't know.  And the worst of all is that there is a perception in the Prime Minister that with an apology he has cleaned up and the Greeks will forget.  The Prime Minister has been apologizing for his mistakes for 3 years.  He apologised for Tempe.  Apologise for the surveillance.  He apologized for the inconvenience of drivers on Attiki Odos.  He apologised for the fires in Evia.  How many more apologies does he have to make before he resigns?  We tell him that we do not accept his apology.  We call for the resignation of the government.  We ask that no former transport and infrastructure minister stand as a candidate in this election.
