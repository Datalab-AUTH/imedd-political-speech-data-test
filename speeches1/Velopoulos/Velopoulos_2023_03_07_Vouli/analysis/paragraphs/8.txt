 Give me a serious excuse why you went to Tempe.  I was watching a party leader giving blood in the hospital and smiling.  Others went to the scene of the accident as if they were returning to the scene of the crime.  At the memorial you went and chatted with each other, smiled, others were staring at their mobile phones.  How can the ordinary citizen believe you like this.  Searches were stopped for 40 minutes so that the cameras could catch the President throwing flowers at the trains, while the searches were still taking place.  Father who lost his child said that Mrs Sakellaropoulou was throwing flowers as if she had gone to a boulangerie.
