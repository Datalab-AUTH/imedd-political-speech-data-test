 We have the Berlin-Baghdad axis, we have the ports of Hamburg, Rotterdam and Antwerp.  And on the other hand we have the port of Piraeus, the only port in the world that does not have a train.  All this shows that Germany is behind.  All your prime ministers have had a ban from Germany on trains going to Piraeus.  But it's not just the Germans.  It's your friends the contractors who make a profit from the tolls, it's your friend who owns the airline.  We have a duty not to be silent, because this is not about Mati with the wind of 11 Beaufort, it is not about Ilia with the wind of 9 Beaufort, it is not about Varybobi with apnea.
