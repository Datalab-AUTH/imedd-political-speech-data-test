TUESDAY 7 MARCH 2023 Speech of the President of the Hellenic Solution Kyriakos Velopoulos in the Parliament, during the debate and vote on the principle, the articles and the whole of the draft law: "Redistricting and decentralization of the competences of the ordinary administrative courts, organization of telematics sessions, conversion of transitional seats and establishment of telematics court offices - Other urgent regulations of the Ministry of Justice". I'll start with something that proves how rotten the Southwest is.  The desperate people of the Southwest are spreading a false, ill-conceived, unarticulated text.  They're peddling it to "wash" the murder of our children.
