Political priests. So-called activists have discovered the most lucrative industry for getting rich. Human trafficking because that's what NGOs do. And I have to tell you, Mr. Mitarakis, that 10% of the workforce in the United States works in non-governmental organizations.  Listen, he's working a little, which means, Mr. Matarakis, he's getting paid.  Which means, it's not volunteerism, it's not humanitarianism, it's making a living from the slave trade. It is a percentage equivalent to the employment of retailers 10% of US citizens work in NGOs and 10% in retail in the United States.  The same thing is happening in Europe and let our friends who are on the theories learn that unfortunately or fortunately the truth is that money is not a voluntary contribution or work, it is a lucrative occupation in any non-governmental organization, so it is not treated by sentient beings as charity but as money-making. So it's a front for a speculative activity and that's not the worst thing.
