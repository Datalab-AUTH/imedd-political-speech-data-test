 I understand your weakness element I understand the weakness of the congestion of our islands in the eastern Aegean.  Why it became congested and notaraki.  Why are you afraid of these people.  Because why did you never do the push back that is allowed by the Geneva Convention, that's why the islands are filled with these people who are persecuted, who are unhappy.  Yes, but let's agree on common sense, when my house, Mr. Mitarakis, fits into a one-square-foot house, mine is bigger, it doesn't matter. 4 people you will not load 4 more into me I can't I can't I can't I will push you I will push you out of the house, I will not allow you to come into my house just things.
