To choose you must want to govern.  So if you want to govern, you say so directly. Because we don't want to cooperate with any of you. It is Aristotle's logic with which we identify completely the whole.  It is greater than the sum of its parts.  We are the whole and you are part of the problem and you are part of the problem in the parts of the problems and then you are the sum of your parts and your own policies and we don't agree with their arithmetic.  It's a numerical oversight.
