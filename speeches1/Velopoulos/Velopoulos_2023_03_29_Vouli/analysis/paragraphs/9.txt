But according to the principles of economics, Mr. Mitarakis, when you want and you don't have a supply of a Premortal, what do you do to raise the price? You ask others and others to come here.  So, in order to make more money and more money, it needs more immigrants, more products because for them products are unfortunately not human, philanthropic behaviour, they need other products and other people and other people to come to get more money, so that they can get some amounts per capita. It's like the slave traders from Africa used to do in the old days, carrying per capita and taking money.  The same goes for NGOs.  Thus, beneficiaries resort to creating artificial demand. This is the reality of speculators at the expense of unhappy people. The society of the nation states, the rest of the citizens of Europe. What we say.
