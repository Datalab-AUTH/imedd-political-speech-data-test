And to say this. I want you to tell me how many of those who were legalized will have a voter registration card in the next election. That no one. The 25. 000 in the Municipality of Athens announced the day before yesterday is none. Look it up a little, 25 were announced the day before yesterday. 000 nationalisations.  Tell me how many of them will vote.  Because if the municipality of Athens is 25. 000, including some Albanians, who live here, I understand, but if there are also Pakistanis who stay for two, three, four, five years, you know what we have, Mr.Mitarakis, alteration of the will of the Greek citizens, of the democratic process, so as not to hurt me, one person who lives here for decades according to the law and another who we put out of the window and the municipality of Poiis, it is not the same thing. Demetrakis and I will remind those who are obsessed or have a short memory.
