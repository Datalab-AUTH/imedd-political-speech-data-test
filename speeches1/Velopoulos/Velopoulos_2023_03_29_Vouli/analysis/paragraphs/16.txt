 Many of you not you personally may have a political interest in reproducing this story. And Mr. Mitarakis, in a state that is truly an enemy of a state as passionate as Greece is towards the Greeks, I will answer you. With the statement of the President of the Single Parents of Greece, Natasha Dalaklis, who denounced. Every immigrant Greek mother mother mother who raises her child alone Mr.Mitarakis, not me president is the woman every immigrant has priority in the lists of OAED for finding a job, will have the right to a pension by completing 1000 credits 3 years of work will have tax immunity, will have free housing, electricity, water, Internet, they promote so, says this lady, no, I racism against Greek needy families. This is not a state, this is a state that hates the Greek, the indigenous of the indigenous, the native.  So we are telling you this because the only solution to free ourselves from stereotypes and logics that are known to all parties from the left, the so-called left, the centre, the centre-right of the right, is a single solution to return to the Greeks.  What they should have and what they deserve, we should give back to them.  Give us a four-year term, Greeks, and we'll pay you back for all this. Because you deserve it. And so we say to them, what are we going to do.  It's very simple.
