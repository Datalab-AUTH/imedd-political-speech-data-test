For the graft of Mr Mitsotakis and company. Mr Mitarakis, it doesn't take much brainpower to understand that you have made an industry.  Not just you personally, but everyone defining these parties, these non-governmental organisations. You've made industry this avalanche of non-governmental organizations that an invisible hand of a global guiding hand is launching and implementing and they reveal that governments are doing their bidding. So I will say this, Mr Mitarakis, if you go to Google. And click on NGO.  You will see.
