To deceive the Greek people many times.  We are sounding alarm bells even for the banks.  Be careful, because the story of the world's banks will also go to Stournaras.  What he says is that they say this before I pushed it or that the banks are safe, the bonds are safe and the Greek bondholder who trusted the Greek state lost his money. So we say to you and we insist on what you did to your politicians and friends.
