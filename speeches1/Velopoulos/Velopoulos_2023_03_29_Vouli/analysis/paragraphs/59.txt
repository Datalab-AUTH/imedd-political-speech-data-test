 The German Foreign Minister this morning called for a change to the Skopje Constitution.  Listen now to include in this existence of a Bulgarian minority. It's shocking that the German Foreign Minister intervened and nobody is talking, nobody understands what's going on. When Germany asks for a change in the Constitution of Skopje in order to create a Bulgarian minority in Skopje, it may prove that the Germans did not really want to help Greece on the issue of Skopje and it means developments that we cannot imagine in the next few years and Kovacevic, who is the Prime Minister of Skopje, comes out and says that the Macedonians of Greece have the right to self-determination and then 200. 000 Skopje Greeks who disappeared in the latest census.  What is it.  Tell me what you guys would call.
