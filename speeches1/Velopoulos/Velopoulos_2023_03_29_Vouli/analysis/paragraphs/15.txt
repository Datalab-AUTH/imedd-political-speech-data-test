 What the New Democracy was saying.  What she promised in her leaflet.  Campaign promises of immediate deportations, campaign leaflet, closed accommodation centres, intensive checks of legal documents.  These promised that made mass asylum without control of flows, relocations in the hinterland made the Takis to avoid being the man elected element wanted to decongest his island and transferred them. Yes, in Greece, instead of sending them back open accommodation centers and law agreements, exactly the opposite of what you said, Mr. Mitarakis during the election and hijack the vote of the hippopotamus, you do post-election. That's who you are, you have phobic syndromes, not to say financial interest.
