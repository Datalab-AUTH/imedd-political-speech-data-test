That's what I want to hear. And what do you do with 7 years.  It says illegal residence in Greece You can bring legalized illegal immigrants to illegal immigrants or to immigrants.  I have in front of me the permit documents, it will become practical yet says and if it is the administrative deportation or return decisions have not been executed, i.e. they catch me in Germany as an illegal immigrant.  Of course, my parents went regular on immigration and I know what an immigrant matriarch means.  I don't know if any of you here know what an immigrant is.  I went to a German school. Blackhead, they used to call me and I wasn't the child of a prime minister. Former Prime Minister, like the Honourable George Andreas Papandreou, not I was a miner's son.  So I know what my parents mean by immigrant.  I went with certain procedures, they didn't enter through the windows, they didn't break through the doors, they didn't break through the borders, they didn't check, medical, preventive and all these things a coordinated state has to do.
