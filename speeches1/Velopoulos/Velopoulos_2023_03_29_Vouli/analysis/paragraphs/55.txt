Since they have come to an agreement with SYRIZA, what are you confusing us with, "Filis wants Aegean presses".Mrs.Bakoyannis wants Aegean presses, both of them want it.Filis doesn't want mining in Greece, Mr.Dendias said it this morning, Mitsotakis does not want to mine in Greece, that is what you want more to understand that the party government of New Democracy SYRIZA and PASOK is coming and closing to understand what the rules of the Parliament mean. Because for us there is no unknown in the next elections.  What Mrs Bakoyannis said. We exclude Mr.Velopoulos, because it is impossible to cooperate with a party that has diametrically opposed views on national issues.  From us this is my answer to those who think they can fool the Greek people forever.  You can't.
