 Obligation to publish balance sheets. I mean, I have an NGO that gets a government grant.  10 million euros I don't announce balance sheets, there are people working there I don't know how much money they get, each of them can get 2 grand and 3 grand and 5 grand and 10 grand.  I can take it and their pocket something from there in that money, the state cannot control it, according to the principles of economics, but there is something worse because these are also tax issues and here we have black money, very black money with NGOs and black money or money that is not taxed. To know what we're talking about is not money, it's just being moved by an illegal activity.  Give me and my business the opportunity not to pay 300 euros every year. 000 euro tax. But I do and I hate my business. Is it possible that there is a serious person who believes all this.
