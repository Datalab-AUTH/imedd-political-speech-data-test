 This is what you are doing with Turkey.  Unfortunately, you have created a Greece as described by Kostis Palamas: "You have no Olympian Gods, no Ossa, no gentlemen, you have land-grubbers, you have mother earth, you have crouching for the waste, hollow men and ogres despise your divine coarse language, the laughingstocks of Europeans and the clowns of the ancients.". The Greeks do not deserve this Greece.  We want a proud, self-reliant and self-reliant Greece.
