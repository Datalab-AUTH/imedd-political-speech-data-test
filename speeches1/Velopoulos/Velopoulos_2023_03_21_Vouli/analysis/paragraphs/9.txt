 No action is taken directly.  All done step by step.  And I wonder about the short memory of both SYRIZA and its voters.  Why SYRIZA opened the door for the privatization of water.  The SYRIZA government submitted a multi-bill (2017-2018) which provides that: the public shares in EYDAP and EYATH are transferred automatically and without consideration to the public holding company.  That is to say, the Ypertha Fund.
