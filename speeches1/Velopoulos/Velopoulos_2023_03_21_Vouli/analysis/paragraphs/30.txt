We also have the risk of fires.  In a few days the fire season starts and we have no firefighting aircraft. Danger also exists in universities.  Our university buildings are abandoned and crumbling.  We had marbles falling from the canteen shed at the University of Thessaloniki, we had plaster falling from the ceiling at the faculties of Dentistry and Physical Education at the University of Athens.
