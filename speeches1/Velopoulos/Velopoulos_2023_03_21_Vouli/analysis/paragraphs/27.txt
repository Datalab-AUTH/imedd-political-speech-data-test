 What does the Prime Minister mean by all this?  That children were sacrificed to make a railway in Greece.  What the Prime Minister means.  That Greece is a Minotaur that wants children for sacrifice.  If it were your children you would say the same thing.  You have made Greece a minotaur of family rule, party rule and the interconnectedness that negates the country.  The best justification is to replace the political staff before it is too late.
