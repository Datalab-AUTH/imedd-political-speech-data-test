And what have you brought to parliament.  For centuries there have been wars over water.  Where water has been privatised (Germany, France, Bolivia, Ecuador) we have had a tripling of the price of water.  Result: people could not pay.  According to UN estimates, by 2035 40% of the world's population will be living in water scarcity conditions.  The big companies, especially Nestle, which is part of Blackroc, because of water scarcity, are demanding that water cease to be considered a commodity.  That is, to be freely available to people.  While all Greeks are mourning for the accident that happened in Tempe you go to pass "night" such an essential change.  You are going to privatise water. Don't start making excuses that that's not the way things are and that you do it differently.
