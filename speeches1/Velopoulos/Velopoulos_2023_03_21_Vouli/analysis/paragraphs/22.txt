 Because it delays the work and in the meantime your bastards get paid.  The same with the BOAK in Crete.  Tell me, has there ever been a survey of how many managers are best friends with contractors. I really wonder how the state works.  There is no one leader to bring order to disorder.  But the answer is that in order to find a leader, first you have to find a people.  And now the RAS is putting out a statement saying that the training of OSE staff was inadequate.  The Authority refers to "strong indications that the theoretical and practical training was incomplete and therefore inadequate".  Thus, the RAS proceeds to the recall of all those who participated in the same training course.  I wonder if justice should intervene for the RAS itself.
