And I like that the company, Hellenic Train answered in a document to my question.  So says Hellenic Train: according to the records kept by our company and according to the statement of the transit customer (i.e. it has a customer who has the role of a front porter). , who said that they were carrying two empty containers and nothing else), on the type of goods to be transported, the contents of the containers are as follows: The first two containers after the engine were empty of cargo.  Tell me have you seen a truck cruising down the road empty of cargo.  And it's nice to accept that this is the way things are.
