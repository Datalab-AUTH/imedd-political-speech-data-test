(Foreign publication)- PRESS RELEASE - HELLENIC SOLUTION - FROM THE PRESS OFFICE OF HELLENIC SOLUTION: Speech of the President of Hellenic Solution Kyriakos Velopoulos in the Parliament, during the debate and vote on the principle, the articles and the whole draft law21/03/23Starting with the fact that we have a different approach to energy and energy-related issues, I would like to say that we have a different approach.  We've talked about it, we've proposed oil and gas exploration, we've warned about wind turbines and their toxic waste that in 20 years you won't know what to do with it.  You are a government working for wind turbines and it will be seen in the next few years who is right and who is wrong.  But you do not hear the voice of reason.  But 21 days have passed since the accident in Tempe and the loss of young people, children, and I see that the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition did not come to the parliament to speak.  They know they are not doing the right thing and by their attitude they prove that they are cowards and do not take responsibility.  I won't go along with the Prime Minister's logic of telling Avtia - your man - that he supervises all the ministries, has antennas everywhere and knows what's going on.  He probably meant Predator.
