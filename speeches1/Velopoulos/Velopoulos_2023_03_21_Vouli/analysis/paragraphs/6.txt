 Proof.  The decision of the Florina court -a political decision- and of a Mrs. Tsimeroglou, who defied Mr. Doyakos, who sent an order to change the decision on the pseudo body shop in Florina.  We will pursue it by every legal means.  He sacrificed Greece and Macedonia at the urging of the government.  Here is the decision (filed in the minutes).  I accuse you of intervening on the Macedonia issue, I accuse you of doing nothing on the Prespa Agreement, I accuse you of cancelling the rallies.  The silence of the Macedonian MPs 172 times, as many as the violations of the Prespa agreement committed by Skopje, is proof that Zaev's "thank you" did not go in vain, it did not go without a fight.
