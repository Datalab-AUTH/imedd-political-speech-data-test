 Why do you avoid calling all the transport ministers, the deputy ministers and the officials since 2012 and the company and the OSE officials?  All these people for the Hellenic Solution are under indictment.  All these people would have to be in wristbands if there was a state.  You're going to go back to laundering the case. Reading everyone's correspondence, I realize that they were all letting everyone know that the system wasn't working, that nothing was working.  You all knew.
