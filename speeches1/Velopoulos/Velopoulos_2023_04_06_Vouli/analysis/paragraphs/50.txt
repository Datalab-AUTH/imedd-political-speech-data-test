 A country that is the GDP per capita we are third from the bottom third from the bottom in the European Union and they are happy and they are delighted that Greece is getting rich, Greece is rich, growth is coming, not their friends, their friends, their friends, their own people are getting rich, Greece is not getting rich. They support consumption with 50 billion in loans, they supported it with loans, but the GDP decreased by 2.4 billion and taxes increased by 4 billion, they sold everything and they should be ashamed to celebrate from above. I'm really surprised and to say so that the Greeks now understand it with evidence. Greeks, you who listen and Greeks.
