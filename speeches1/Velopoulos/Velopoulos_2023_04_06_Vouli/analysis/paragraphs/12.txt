 The Greek solution has the moral advantage that the new democracy does not have.  We are not flirting with anyone, your MPs and candidates came and asked to stand for election and we refused.  We are not a football team to make transfers, you are a group, a gang, a political gang, in quotes, that is only interested in gaining power and managing it nothing else.
