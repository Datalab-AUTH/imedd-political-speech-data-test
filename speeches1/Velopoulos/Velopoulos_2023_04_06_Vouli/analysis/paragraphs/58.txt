 Proposals for commissions of inquiry made by the Greek solution and not accepted.  To understand who they are. Cancellation of the Prespes agreement said all no, the fire in Mati to find all the moral and physical perpetrators said all no for the first half of SYRIZA, the 15, the 100 billion lost said all no.  Among them, the new democracy that is arguing with SYRIZA against economic figures. Amendments not supported by anyone, abolition of the fine for unvaccinated persons over 60 years of age.  No one supported. Exceptionally the appointments of polygamous teachers did not support any party's appearance in the media.  No one supported first home protection and loan repayment in case of transfer if no one supported lifting of work stoppage, financial inactivity and their compensation.
