Let's go to the other issue that suddenly became the incident with the policeman in the ASOEE. I didn't understand who was arguing about the shooting. Who disagrees on shooting in the air, not against people, police car trapped by known paracrats, by known little people who a hood can kill, beat up those that the police officer shoots in the air. What is the problem tell me you MPs who have one or two police officers that your leaders have 15, 15, 35, 35, 45, 55 police officers for their safety should not feel safe police officer. The policeman is a policeman.  If you want table workers to take them home you will shoot where you need to in the air and you have to shoot to defend yourself.  You're denying them the opportunity and I'm ashamed to say the obvious.
