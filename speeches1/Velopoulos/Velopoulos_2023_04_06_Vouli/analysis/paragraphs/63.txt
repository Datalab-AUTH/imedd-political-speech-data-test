We go on and on in the presence of our speeches by political leaders. Mitsotakis 76, Koutsoumpas 80, Tsipras 87, Varoufakis 114, the speaker 208.  Because I respect and honor the five and a half grand that I am paid by the Greek people, the bankrupt, that's why I'm here, that's why I'm here every day and I have business, I don't do public relations, I don't do politics. I won't say for our questions all the questions of the Greek solution are more than of the parties together.  In conclusion we say to the Greeks in the elections Vote sensibly Two things are opposite in making the right decision, haste and rage these were said by Thucydides the Great in the past, thousands of years ago, don't vote in haste, not in rage Vote sensibly.  After all, as Aristotle the Great said. Anyone can get angry, it's easy, but to get angry with the right person to the right degree for the right reason, at the right time in the right way.  This is not easy at all.
