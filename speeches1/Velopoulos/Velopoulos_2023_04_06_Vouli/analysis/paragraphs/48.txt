 Writing off all loans of Greeks horizontally to restart the economy, writing off debts to EFKA, tax authorities. And especially bank loan haircuts, Mr. Vezyropoulas, as you did in the first lie, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, he's not here, that is, the value of the life of the shipowner is superior to that of any ordinary citizen of the poor, the industrialist, Nikos from Keratsini, Stavros from Peristeri, George from Kordelio, from a village on the continent, from a village. Crete is richer.  This man's life is poorer than the rich man you are writing off debts. And I say that you are mocking the Greeks and you lie constantly and what bothers me the most is that you don't say what you have achieved and what the 3 parties have achieved.
