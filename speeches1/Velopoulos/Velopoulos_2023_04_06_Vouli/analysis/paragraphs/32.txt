Lord Beowulf, let us remember how this murder was done, the rapture. the deceit, the selfishness. The drying up of love Mr. Voitha to eradicate all this from Greece. That is why we must ask every gentleman, not God, every Greek who will go on 21/05/23 to think sensibly for our Greece, for our country, for our nation, for every Greek, individually a vote for the Greek solution is the only solution.  We're going to go into coalition now. We will speak truths. Why is it possible before elections are held.  Is it possible for all political ministers, MPs of all parties to talk and coalitions.
