Who disagree to tell me. One thing we'll say it all now here the fences don't end.  One problem they do not solve is the problem of illegal immigration.  Fences and if we were wrong when we said fence, we meant concrete anti-tank fence to have and that the time from Turkey for the Turks to be able to advance with tanks you push back, you take away the allowances, you don't say come 180. 000 as the government is doing now made a request for 180 thousand to come legally for 5, 6, 7, 8 years.
