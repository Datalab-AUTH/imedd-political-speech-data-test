This story, Minister, with ESRE is the black page of your democracy. The old democracy, but the democracy of repression, of silencing, of undemocratic selection.  You put an unlikely press president of your powerful own proposal of Mr. Mitsotakis.  It was personal because she wanted him to handle it the way he wanted to handle it and it's become a pistol of the new democracy.  Normal pistol of the new democracy.
