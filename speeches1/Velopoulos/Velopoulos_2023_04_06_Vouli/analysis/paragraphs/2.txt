 We have always criticised, in an elegant, elegant way and in a decent way, without any exaggerations.  The view of Parliament is once again disappointing, as there are always no Members of Parliament, of course. They all have time to go on the morning news channels to parade like political pots, but they don't come to the Greek parliament to perform their own duties for which they are paid by the Greek people.  I am ashamed because my proposal to Mr Tasoulas did not materialise.
