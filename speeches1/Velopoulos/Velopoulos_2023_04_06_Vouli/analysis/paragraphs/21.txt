President of the average is not controlled by anyone. And especially if he breaks the law or does something illegal here, he's not punished for creating a dictatorship, because he can decide whatever he wants and nobody controls it.  That's what you did with the multi-bill, the regulations on the unprosecuted and again the head of the independent authorities.  Do you understand what you are doing because you just own them and you are comfortable with the authorities throwing them out and unprosecuted and creating little dictatorships.
