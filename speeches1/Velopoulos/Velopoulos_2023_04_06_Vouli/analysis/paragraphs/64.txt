 We Greeks are for the hard stuff.  So we're going to be angry with all of them.  We will be late with all of them, but of course we will vote for a Greek solution, we vote correctly, we vote Greek for our Greece, for our homeland, we vote for a Greek solution. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I will. Will.
