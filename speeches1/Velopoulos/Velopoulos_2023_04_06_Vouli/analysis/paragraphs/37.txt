 Nothing had me saying that, because they can't. Because they are incompetent I tell him it's not possible, they can't, they don't have it and he tells me why they don't have it I say because quite simply for them, above everything is the party above Greece is their party above the Greeks is their party, unlike us who above all is Greece and the Greeks.  This is our qualitative difference. And so I say about the coming coalition government. You agree on everything. Let a politician or journalist come along and tell me that PASOK, New Democracy and SYRIZA disagree on all the major issues. On the fence, let's say they disagreed with SYRIZA in a democracy and the Syriza people from here and from the new democracy who disagree are shouting and protesting.  Let me tell you, I'll see you in nothing, because I have the statements here of Mrs.Gerovassili, who said that we will not tear down the fence here, but we will expand it. Statements by Mrs Gerovassilis.
