I read a 2020 Commission report on rule of law in Greece SYRIZA talks about rule of law SYRIZA now. A mockery of the tragic choices of SYRIZA, especially the conversion of bribery from a felony to a misdemeanor in 2020, the law of SYRIZA, the felony of bribery of anyone who was led to the public authority is a minister, is a deputy.  I say now I employee manager became a misdemeanor. Misdemeanor. Bribery.
