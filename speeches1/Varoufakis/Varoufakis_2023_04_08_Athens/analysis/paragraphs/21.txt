 Guess who.  Albert Aidan.    3 general axes axes that bring us together 3 general axes of our programme.  Liberation from exploitation, democracy everywhere, authentic humanism when I talk about liberation from exploitation, the first stage of course, is to break with the plunder, with the red loans, with the energy exchanges, with the total profiteering of the oligarchy, with the patriarchy.  This means immediately applicable solutions to the 100-day programme.  Day 25 alliance for rupture means no repeat of 2015.
