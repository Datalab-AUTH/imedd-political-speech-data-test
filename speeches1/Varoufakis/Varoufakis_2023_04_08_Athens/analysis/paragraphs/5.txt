 I take this opportunity to say that Litcha and I met on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk on Victory Street, under the Treasury, when as the red glove was there to basically to protest against me as I was entering as Finance Minister and instead of having a clash, since then our paths have been inseparable.  Corfu.
