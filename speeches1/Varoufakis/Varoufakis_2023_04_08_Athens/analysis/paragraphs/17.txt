 I read the oligarchy of private capital, whose colossal power cannot be effectively controlled, even in a democratic society.  This is because MPs are elected by political parties funded by businessmen.  Whose aim is to distance the elected deputies from the municipality with a capital D that elected them, as a result of which the representatives of the people do not defend the interests of the underprivileged, and even more so in the current circumstances, or the businessmen inevitably control the main sources of information and education.
