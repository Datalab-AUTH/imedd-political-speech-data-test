You come to Greece, in Greece, in Greece and you buy a 100 red loan from Hercules. 000 for 3 grand, you kill it for 20.  And you've got 17 grand and you've put it in the Cayman Islands.  Applauding Mr Tsipras for launching the secondary market for red loans.  You take a Greek government bond at four and a half percent 100.  Interest rate.  Four and a half percent when the German gives you two and a half.
