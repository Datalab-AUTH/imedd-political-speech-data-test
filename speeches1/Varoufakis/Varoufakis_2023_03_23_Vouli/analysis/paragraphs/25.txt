 I know that when you get the speech you'll say but here he is again, the one who closed the banks.  The banks, Mr. Staikoura, and you know that.  The European Central Bank shut it down just to keep the same oligarchs, the same bankers, along with some criminals like Mr. Paulson, who has taken over Piraeus Bank, who should be a common law criminal and should be in a super prison in the United States right now.  Mocking you now by holding.
