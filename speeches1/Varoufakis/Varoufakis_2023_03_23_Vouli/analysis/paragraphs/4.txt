 In 2008, the banks.  Hail Minister, in 2008 the banks, as they were collapsing, it was already revealed why they were collapsing, there was blatant fraud not only in Lehman Brothers, but in the entire banking sector and in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom.  There was predatory lending, so-called predatory lending, i.e. there was a mafia-like collusion between Moody's, Moody's.  So-called rating agencies and bankers, who were essentially trying to sell seaweed for silk ribbons to their clients.  There was a rash of control mechanisms.  And you could say neither for all these reasons we had the banking collapse, the rot of 2008.  Today.
