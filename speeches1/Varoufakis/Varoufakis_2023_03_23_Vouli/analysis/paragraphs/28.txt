 An article triumphing my triumphalism over the Greek economy confirms.  That what you say that the performance of the Greek economy is excellent, is that we have growth.  As you say, Mr. Staikura, greater than that of the strong economies of Europe.  First of all, anyone reading this should panic because the last time this was said was in 2005.  We're the ones who were all rejoicing here that we had growth rates higher than Germany.  We did have 5% real GDP, it was going up 5%, when it was going up by one and a half percent in Germany and you were happy here was Mr. and Mr. Alogoskoufis, you were talking about a shielded economy.
