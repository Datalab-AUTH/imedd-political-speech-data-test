 Piraeus Bank was closed down in 2015 to keep those in power in the banking system.  In order to continue to operate our Greece as a dystopian laboratory of austerity policies that we warned our comrades, our fellow citizens in France, in Germany, that what they are making here in this dystopian laboratory will be exported to you, any day now, so here is why what is happening in the streets of Paris is happening today.  Why the French people are on the streets.  And the same policy is being demonstrated, which has been expressed here since 2010.  It is burning the peoples of Europe and darkening the future of our children, our children in Germany, in France, in Italy, in Portugal, in Greece.  We.  On day 25 we are and remain committed to the peoples of Europe.  Disobedient insubordinate while you say yes to everything.
