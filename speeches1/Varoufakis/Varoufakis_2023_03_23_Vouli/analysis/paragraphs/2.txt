 Hearing about the evolving banking crisis.  See.  On the one hand inflation and on the other hand stagnation threatening the future.  And they put the question to the government.  How is it going and out comes Mr Staikouras, I heard him yesterday and he talked about a shielded economy and banks that are absolutely safe.  Like it hasn't been 15 years, not 15, 15 days since.  Crisis referee rots the 2007 crisis indicators 8 then another New Democracy government was talking about a shielded Greece and safe banks.  People out there I guess that goes for you too.  Ladies and gentlemen of the government it is certainly true for us they come and ask us, we have a new 2008 ahead of us with the banking crisis, with the dominoes falling.  Ladies and Gentlemen.
