 To the borrowers justice to those who paid off their loan and at the same time have you keep the surplus profits that are now going away and going to the Cayman Islands.  Every time you kill a red loan at auction your choice is not to do this.  The second institutional proposal of day 25.  It is the creation of a fiscal transaction system, which will be based on Taxis Net, which will allow free electronic transactions through Taxis Net.  What I once called the parallel payment system is what you can do in Greece, which should have been done by the European Central Bank, providing digital accounts to citizens.  We can start to do it ourselves free transactions, security of transactions.  Breaking the banking system's monopoly on payments.  the only loser of these 2 institutional proposals of our replacing Hercules with Odysseus and creating this system of financial transactional changes we call Demeter.  The only losers would be the funds and the bankers who hold you by the throat, who mock you, who mock you, who mock you, who you go to ostensibly pressure to be nice to them.  Be kinder to borrowers and really laugh in your face.  This is of course what they hear from us on day 25, Mr Staikoura, the bankers, your friends in the minutes, and they hate us and they hate me personally.  I personally love their hatred, I want to embrace it because I prefer it to the mockery they show in your face.
