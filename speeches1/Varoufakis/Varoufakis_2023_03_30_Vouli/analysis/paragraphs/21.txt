 You have a glorious field of glory to point your arrows at our real positions, as we do with you focus for example that we on day 25 insist on putting forward directly applicable proposals, like Odysseus instead of Hercules.  Public company managing private debts, such as the financial transaction system, Demetra.  Proposals that can be implemented tomorrow morning before socialism comes before Monday comes.  Tell us why this is wrong, why you think it is drastic and unpopular.  Make a serious criticism of what we say, not what we don't say.  Focus on what we reject on day 25.
