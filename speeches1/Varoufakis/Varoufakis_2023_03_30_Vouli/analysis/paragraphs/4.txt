 To hide behind a bill you have to pay that you have to pay before Parliament closes.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  This Parliament no longer has the legitimacy to legislate only one piece of legislation, it has the obligation and legitimacy to pass.  The amendment of day 25 to be given to 500 600. 000 young men and women the right to vote in these elections in their place of work, like the police, like the magistrates, like our soldiers.  The fact that you're not doing it proves that it's not just that a second ballot box has come up in July, but it's your plan because you know that the generation of temps, the young people and the young people out there are going to blackball you and you want to take away.  The vote prove me wrong, it's too easy.  Pass our amendment give young people the right to vote in workplaces.  You don't do it because you are afraid of the youth.  You fear the generation of the lazy.
