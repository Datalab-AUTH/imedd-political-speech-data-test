 And yes, Mr. Alexis Tsipras.  It's monstrosity and to demand to make progressive government so without a program remember the show.  And Mitsotakis.  The lack of self-reliance is not a problem of democracy, it may be a problem of the new democracy, but the lack of self-reliance when you have 30, 32, 35% is democracy.  Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers.  Members of the New Democracy.  Mr Mitsotakis, no government can, is it to be self-reliant really self-reliant, strong.  Even if you have a majority in Parliament.  When the overwhelming majority is against you.  When the majority in Parliament has been wrested from you through the rigged procedures of an electoral law of enhanced proportional representation, enhanced proportional representation, just as the CIA talks about enhanced interrogation, that's what the CIA calls torture, the Troika, the Troika process called enhanced surveillance, so enhanced proportional representation is the rape of democracy.  Friends of SYRIZA, Mr. Tsipras, if you are listening to us.
