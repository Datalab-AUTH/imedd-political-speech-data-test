 The 2 major parties, New Democracy and SYRIZA to devalue in practice the simple proportional representation, New Democracy directly and SYRIZA indirectly.  It's a risk of teratogenesis.  Who is Mr Mitsotakis.  Whoever wants it wants it claims his right to create a monster government.  Because yes, Mr Mitsotakis, it is a monstrosity to require self-reliance against 65% of the voters, to put those who abstained 75% of the voters.  You want self-reliance against the overwhelming majority of the Greek people.  This is a monster, this is monstrosity.
