 With respect to the popular sentiment for this great national mourning, bring a bill that is exclusively targeted at measures to support victims and the affected.  Not by fiddling with them, by inserting these 12 articles into a maze of 132 articles and provisions with gifts and buffers.  For the daydreamers.  But you cannot hold back even in the moment of mourning and devotion.  You have to make everything dirty.  Every good and appropriate thing to use.
