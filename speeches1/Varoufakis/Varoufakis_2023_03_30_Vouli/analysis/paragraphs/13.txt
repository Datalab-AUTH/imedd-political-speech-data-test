 No government, but no government that emerges like this without a programme, even with a simple proportional representation, without a progressive front of our people out there who will support a progressive, consistent, coherent government programme against the oligarchy.  Because only against the oligarchy can there be a truly progressive government programme only with such a progressive front, which is not built from Monday morning, after election Sunday until Wednesday afternoon.  Only one such.
