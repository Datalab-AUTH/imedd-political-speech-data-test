 With justice.  Education, health, information to be passed on to the social control of the entertainers.  we call upon all our political opponents.  Criticise these proposals harshly, focus on this vision and our plan for a democracy that for the first time penetrates both the state and the economy.  With the ultimate goal of each business being managed over time.  I'm not saying it's an easy thing to do today, but this is our vision.  A business run on the basis of one employee, one share, one vote.  With the right of every citizen to a basic income.  We challenge you and invite you to present your own vision to the one that makes the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture the only party with a governmental program instead of an anti-capitalist, green, self-managing and deeply democratic one.  Will.  As we approach the end of this Parliament, allow me, on behalf of day 25, to wish all and sundry.  To have a tough.  But a clean election campaign.  Because that is the only way to convince the citizens who are disappointed with our parliamentarianism out there that democracy has a chance to recover in these lands.  Thank you.  And thank you, Mr. President.
