 Your DNA.  It tells you that we are right in what we say.  What I have just said I am sure speaks to your soul in your Ooi.  Unfortunately your leadership while you were in government after the capitulation of July 15.  Your leadership has given land and water to the Greek trains, airports and other things to the oligarchs while you were in government, but even today.  Despite the outcry of the oligarchs from the people outside, especially the youth.  You continue to push the oligarchs, promising them that you will not re-privatise the trains.  You will not abolish the energy exchange all that you did, that is, in your four years you will not abolish Hercules.  All those false market abominations that make our country a serfdom today.
