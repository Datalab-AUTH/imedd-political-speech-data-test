 A semi-privatized EYDAP EYDATH in 2 pieces, in the private equity model and that's what they will do.  They will create 2 companies, one will have the infrastructure and no employees, the other will have employees and no infrastructure.  The company with the infrastructure will be made to borrow huge amounts of money from foreign funds, which they will put in their pockets and then they will make the company that has no infrastructure but has employees pay rent.  In the company that has infrastructure and has no employees and then you'll go to the employees and say, you have to reduce your wages because we have a lot of rent to pay in the company that has infrastructure and has no employees.
