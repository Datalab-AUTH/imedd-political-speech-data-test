 Of course I heard you say that it is not privatisation, as you had the audacity to tell us the other day that the concession of the children's hospitals to Mrs Marianna Vardinoyannis was not public privatisation and that is what you say.  The regulatory authority will simply supervise, it will be the arbiter of the benefits that will remain public you are not telling us.  Leave it to rot to put in a public regulator.  To regulate the public is as stupid as having a referee when you play solitaire alone that's what you're doing, but you're not stupid you're four-faced you're.
