 Today tomorrow you will vote against this plan or you will be shut down again and locked up in your foolish tactic of not voting.  You submit anti-constitutionality proposals here and you do not vote.  Admit here the foolishness of your leadership and that vote no on this bill will be demanded by the workers tomorrow and it is not bad to say that you made a mistake in the wrong tactics.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President.  This House.
