 It's a problem for this government that it can doodle.  Mitsotakis A E to tolerate A E, a public company, to tolerate the water to remain public without a problem.  It overturns ANYTHING in the narrative that private is always better than public.  Citizens are wondering, but didn't this narrative just collapse in Tempe?  It did not collapse with the privatization of the PPC with the energy exchange with Hercules.
