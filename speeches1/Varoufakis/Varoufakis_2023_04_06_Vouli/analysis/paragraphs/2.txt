 Take a look at this Irish fund based in Delaware with a bank account in Cayman Island.  As we speak, he's foreclosing.  After an auction of a house of earthquake victims in Arkalochori, while the so-called independent public revenue authority Adae has made seizures to the alleged.  Seized accounts that had relief funds for our earthquake victims.  Please contradict me.  The only alternative you have is to run out of here running with your tail between your legs in shame is your shame.  This will confiscate.  Account attachment by the tax authorities and simultaneous auctions by an Irish fund.  Earthquake-affected hearths.
