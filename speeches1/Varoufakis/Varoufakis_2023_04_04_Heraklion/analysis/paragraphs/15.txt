 It's science fiction.  What do the Irish, based in Delaware and with an account in Cayman Island, want the Irish to get houses demolished.  They're even knocked down, they want to take the showers.  The rubble that the mayor has no money to move.  I want them to get these too because you know why they want it.  Because the money is a lot.  Bean by bean fills the bag or the Irish in Cayman Island Why.
