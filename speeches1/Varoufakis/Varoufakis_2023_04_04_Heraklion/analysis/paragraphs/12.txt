 I was with fellow travelers in Arkalochori.  I don't need to tell you now what the word "arkalochori" means in Heraklion.  But it does matter.  If only for a moment to realize what is happening in Arkalochori, which is important because it is the tip of the iceberg of the misfortunes that have hit this country after the signing of the memoranda, especially the third and fourth.
