   Think about what a wind turbine means, never mind that there are not supposed to be wind turbines on land.  Wind turbines in a maritime country like ours should be floating like they are in Denmark.  There is not a single wind turbine on land in Denmark.  And yet.  Denmark produces 75% of its electricity from wind turbines at sea, how nice it would be if they were floating out there somewhere away from the fishing villages, away from the villages, out of sight and generating electricity for the people.  That would be bad, but no, they go and set up a wind turbine 150.  Measures.  Third hand third hand third hand not even second German who do not want the Germans come send her here.
