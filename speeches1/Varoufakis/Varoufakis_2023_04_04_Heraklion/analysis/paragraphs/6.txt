 I met George for the first time when.  Without a programme almost in February 2016 we came from Europe to Berlin to found DIEM 25 and the journey is long.  The second person that I want to introduce to you that you know, but you don't know until day 25 by now you may have heard about it, but we haven't officially announced it, is Marios Dionellis, the well-known and unexceptional journalist.  It will be a great honor.  It will adorn the ballot paper on Day 25.
