 Plevris to put forward his basic argument which says in essence that nothing changes, it was public and remains public, just by converting these structures into a legal entity under private law we have more flexibility, can get sponsorships, spend more money, invest more money in children's health in these oncology centres. Let me explain to you why things are not like that at all and why this is the worst form of privatisation.  Think about it, when you take a clinic or an oncology centre and you say to the management that you appoint directly as a minister-that's how it is-"get sponsorships to spend on top of the government grant"; think about it, the more successful the management is in finding sponsorships, the greater the dependence on those sponsorships in the future and the greater the dependence on those sponsorships, the greater the incentives for the next minister, after Mr.  Pleyris, to freeze the government grant or even reduce it and the greater the pressure on the next board to find sponsorships and the greater the dependence of the next and the next board on private potential sponsors.   You see, it's a vicious circle.
