 Ladies and gentlemen, we in MERA25 have a specific proposal that does not only concern this particular case.  You know we dislike bureaucracy, we dislike statism, we dislike the oligarchic capital, but we also dislike the capital that is not oligarchic, the private individuals who decide and order what will happen with the colleges, what will happen with the private clinics, with the legal entities under private law.  We have a concrete proposal on how to save this country from both the inefficiency and corruption of the private sector and the inefficiency and corruption of statism. Our proposal is based on the idea of consultative councils made up of a majority of elected citizens, bodies to which the management of public structures will be accountable, bodies which will appoint the management of public structures.  Here's how the best of the state we have could be combined with the civil society out there.  You choose the worst combination of private and public.
