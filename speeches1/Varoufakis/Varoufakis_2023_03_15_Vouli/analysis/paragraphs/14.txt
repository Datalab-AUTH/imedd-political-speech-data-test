 Your bill, ladies and gentlemen of the government, is a remnant of a dark era of this combination.  Ultimately, in the climate of mourning for the Tempi, with the youth out there having rejected both your privatisation and statism, what we have an obligation today - and we as MPA25 are trying to live up to this obligation - is to propose ways in which public structures, public goods are under the control of civil society.  You lack any legitimacy to legislate right now.  You are at the end of a four-year term where you have basically destroyed what you could of the good parts of the public sector, giving it to the worst parts of the oligarchic private sector.  Lack of legitimacy.  It's time to dissolve Parliament, hold elections, leave the government.
