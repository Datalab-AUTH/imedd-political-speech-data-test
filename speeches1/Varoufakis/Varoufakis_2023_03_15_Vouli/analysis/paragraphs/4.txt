 Clinical trials.  This dream that is happening in the United States.  In order to be able to get sponsorships from pharmaceutical companies or from individuals who have shares in pharmaceutical companies you have doctors who are forced, not to choose in the context of their own research, but are forced to convince the parents of the children of such a paediatric clinic or a clinic in general to participate in this kind of clinical trials, not of their own research projects, but of the pharmaceutical companies who are paying the dough to keep the clinic running, to be paid in the end, and to be able to continue to operate the clinic.
