 This is the result of break-up and privatisation.  And finally, when he saw that privatization of a public good, which is public even after privatization, to the extent that there are so-called externalities, that is, every passenger who gets on a train.  Helps to decongest the road network.  This is a social benefit which you do not measure when you treat rail as a different market from motorways.  And so you fall at the mercy of collusion between mafia big bankers like Goldman Sachs.  Remember the tolls that were sold under Simitis and with the toll motorway oligarchs, in other words, terna on one side and actor on the other.  It is the crows who create conditions of virtual plunder of the public good, which transport, not only railways, but.  The motorway.
