 Country Passousis pass state-owned foreign company Scratched because Fraport is state-owned and World and Efes are state-owned.  OSE was re-nationalised by the wrong state.  And when I was telling them that Efes is bankrupt.  It belongs completely.  You know this.  Completely in the Italian Ministry of Finance and has not a penny to put into upgrading our trains.  You know what they used to say to me.
