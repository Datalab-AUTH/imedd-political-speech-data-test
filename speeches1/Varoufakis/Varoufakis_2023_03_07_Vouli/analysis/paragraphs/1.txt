I begin with the deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Mera 25.  To families.  The friends.  The societies, the communities.  To all of us.  For losing so many people.  We Mera 25 ladies and gentlemen do not need any committee whatsoever to tell us what was wrong.  Our deputies.  Crito Arsenis and Kleon Gregoriadis.  They presented the conclusion of what was to blame before the tragedy happened 21/03/2022 from this podium.  Crito Arsenis.
