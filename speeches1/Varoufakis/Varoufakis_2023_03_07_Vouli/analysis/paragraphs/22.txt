 The same triptych of destruction, devaluation of the public sector, breaking up of the public network and privatisation of parts of it is being applied here in Parliament today.  You do it on water, you dare to bring a bill that gives Rae says regulation of the water market.  You have written on your old shoes, even the civil state, even the Council of State.  You insist on privatizing water as if we don't know that where water has been privatized, failure and disaster is a given.  Ask the people of Berlin who were forced to insist on revolution.  Nationalisation of the.  And it's not just the water you make.
