 Officers, we don't have an official opposition and you Syriza people are now sitting there and focusing and you're not a little bit ashamed of which stationmaster is your own.  Nothing new, of course, because you embraced the new democracy, you voted for the third and fourth memorandum, so.  As now in these three and a half years of this parliamentary term.
