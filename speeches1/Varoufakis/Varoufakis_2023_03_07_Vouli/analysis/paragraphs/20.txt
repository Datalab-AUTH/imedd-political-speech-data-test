 Ladies and gentlemen of the new democracy.  On this sad day.  We hide even more because we have a government that doesn't care.  The truth is only interested in the cover-up through hollow commissions.  Is it possible that you appointed a three-member committee at will, in which you even put the man to whom you had given the order to break up and privatise OSE?  The wolf guarding the sheep.  Hollow committees on the one hand for the cover-up and brutal repression in the streets and squares the day before yesterday Your hoodlum deltas ran over 4 5 lawyers of the alternative lawyers movement with their motorbikes.  Rabid riot police were hitting our block and I'm sure other blocks.
