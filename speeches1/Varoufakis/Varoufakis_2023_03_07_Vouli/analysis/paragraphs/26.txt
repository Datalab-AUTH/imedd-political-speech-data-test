 Together with them you gave the Greek to Latchi, the shipyards, the skerries, the train.  We didn't expect anything different.  As you set up that night of the referendum in the new democracy, calling illusions all those things that today the citizens out there have understood that not only are not illusions, but are prerequisites for a viable country.  For divestment of the goals from Greece, abolition of Hercules and the Energy Exchange, renationalization and immediate socialization of the Public Power Corporation, water, trains, health care.  Even now, Mr.Tzanakopoulos, I see you here, you are going to apologise for the privatisation of the trains.  You will apologise even on the basis that you have given in to the Troika.  Say it in practice and at the same time denounce not only the Troika but also the motorway cartels that go hand in hand with Ephes, Alstom and Aktor.  We are Christians to be transparent to the Greek people.
