 It is in your nature.    As it is your nature to do your best to keep young people from voting.  We have tabled an amendment.  The amendment which will allow young people working as hotel employees in the middle of the summer to vote at their place of work.  Please the Kuku√© and SYRIZA if you want to support this amendment, you don't think about it because you want young people not to vote, because you know that you will be blackballed as you deserve.  But ladies and gentlemen of the new democracy.  Whenever you hold the election.  From as many young people and as many as you deprive of the right to vote we will be there.  Day 25 other democratic forces, so that the ballot boxes express popular sentiment.  No tolerance for the ongoing oligarchic crime.  Not in season, because abstinence means tolerance.  Of wood not of wood.  So neither protest, nor anger, nor condemnation.
