 The shamina.  The Peloponnese on fire in 2007, Matti, North Evia, Attiki Odos.  The truth is, it's not the fault of the Troika and all that, it was just a bad climate.  The troika came and gave up, the cup overflowed.    Fortunately though I repeat, that's fine out there defending, you'll hit them again.  With your mats and your deltoids, there's no doubt.
