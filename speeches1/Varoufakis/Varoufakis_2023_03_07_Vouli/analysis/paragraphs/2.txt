 He invited you.  He pleaded, he used the words, I ask you to protect our rail workers and passengers.  3 months later Cleon Gregoriadis.  From the minutes of the House of Representatives, he said the following, a delegation from Mera 25 visited the Stasi depot in Sepolia.  I know this because I was in that echelon.  There you know what we learned that 30 workers are responsible for the entire line 2 Anthoupolis Greek and line 3 from Nice to Dukissis Plakentias.  Out of 64 workers there were 30 left.  Not only are they understaffed, but they are missing and tools which break down are not replaced.  And working maintenance workers are forced to make patents.  These people, the thief continued, in violation of all labor laws have been working 7 days in a row, they have only 2 light maintenance vehicles left now and these have been decommissioned.  Sooner or later this galley will have an accident and then.  As with the finding for the foreman Petros Yamalis who was killed by such a locomotiva and has not been released yet 7 months now these were said by Kleonas on 21/06/2022.  The conclusion that will come out will say that this poor 30 is to blame for killing the travelling public.  That's what you always do.
