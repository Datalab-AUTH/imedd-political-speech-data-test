 To describe how the daily movement of citizens will be neither a risk nor an adventure, but nothing more than a routine, because that is what it should be, as it should be in any serious state, as the Constitution itself ultimately requires.  Because, my friends, democracy does not exist as a process once in four years.  Democracy, I would say, is the contract.  And the terms of this contract are security and justice everywhere and for all.  These are the minimum, the formal obligations of a government to its citizens.  And if a government not only cannot secure them, but repeatedly becomes itself an agent of their undermining, then this is a dangerous government that must go. For this reason, our event today and every aspect of our plan that will be presented in the coming months is for us much more than a series of political proposals.  They are the foundations on which we will rebuild trusting relationships.
