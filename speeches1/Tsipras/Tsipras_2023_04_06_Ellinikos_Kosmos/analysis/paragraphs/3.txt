 In the shadow of not one sacrifice.  But of an unspeakable tragedy that could and should have been avoided.  In the face of such events, those of us who have found ourselves and hope to find ourselves again in positions of responsibility, those of us who ask for the vote of the people should - all of us - stand before the debt imposed by our conscience and our morality.  And this debt today is clear.  Let us never allow such a tragedy to happen again.  To do our utmost, at any cost, to make every citizen feel safe in their travels.  Consult experts, listen to employees, study best practices that exist internationally.
