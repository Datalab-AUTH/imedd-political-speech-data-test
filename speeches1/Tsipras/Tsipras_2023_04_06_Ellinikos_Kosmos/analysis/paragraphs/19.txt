So we proceed in three steps: First, with the establishment, implementation and operation of a digital Central Licensing System.  Interconnection of all bodies and services of the public and wider public sector involved in the licensing and approval procedures for public and private technical works, as well as all the control bodies and authorities. The entire approval and licensing process will now be handled electronically.  The system will also include the special categories of permits and approvals from bodies and services such as the Forestry Service, the Ephorates of Antiquities, the Council of Architecture, the Fire Brigade and others.
