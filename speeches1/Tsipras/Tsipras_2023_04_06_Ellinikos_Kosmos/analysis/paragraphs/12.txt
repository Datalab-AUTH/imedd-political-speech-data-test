So for these reasons, today I decided in this very interesting, very worthwhile conference of the Infrastructure Sector of SYRIZA on infrastructure security, not to make proposals and positions on technical issues, or to analyze the necessary prioritization of audits and inspections in critical public infrastructure.  I am sure that at all the round tables and in the statements of very distinguished speakers who have come to this conference today, these will be said, documented and recorded in detail in our positions and proposals. Today I want to take the debate much deeper and talk about the root of the evil in public administration and in the execution of public works and propose solutions.  Not only to make findings.  So let's get to the point.
