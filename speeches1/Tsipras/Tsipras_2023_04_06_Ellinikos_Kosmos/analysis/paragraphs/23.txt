 In short, we are creating a National Digital Infrastructure Registry, but in which all maintenance actions, all security certifications are recorded, so that we know at any time what the state of public infrastructure is and therefore what needs to be done to ensure the safety of its use. With these three interventions we ensure transparency in the project implementation process and gain control and the necessary knowledge of the security status of all public infrastructures. I am convinced that our plan for Transparency in the implementation of public projects and in the maintenance and operation of public infrastructure is a top institutional breakthrough, similar to other top institutional breakthroughs in the operation of the Public Administration.  Similar to other transparency and merit-based interventions.  It is a breakthrough that will give the necessary institutional tools of control to the Administration, but also will instil a different mentality in public officials.  And above all another relationship between public services and private individuals. A relationship that, if streamlined, will ensure public resources, speed in the implementation of projects and, most importantly, security for the citizen, which is what we are looking for. This is our plan, friends, this is a radical institutional breakthrough that we are determined to put into practice in the functioning of the administration to ensure transparency, quality, speed and above all the safety of public infrastructure.  With these thoughts, I want to thank you, to congratulate you for this conference.  And of course I pledge that we will take into account all the views that will be presented here today to do everything possible to avoid in the future a similar tragedy like the one we experienced a few days ago with the 57 of our fellow citizens who were unjustly lost in Tempe. Thank you very much.
