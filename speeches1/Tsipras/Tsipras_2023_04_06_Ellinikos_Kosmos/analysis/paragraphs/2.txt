But we are still here today in a country that is mourning.  Not even 40 days have passed since this tragic event, the tragic accident in Tempe that unjustly cut short the lives of 57 of our fellow human beings, including many young children.  And we are here today in a country that is mourning, in a society that is still wondering.  And with a government that continues to arrogantly ignore responsibility.  We are here today, in the shadow of Tempi.
