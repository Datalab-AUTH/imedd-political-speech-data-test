 Shedding light where today there is shadow, or there is darkness. At the heart of our proposal is a new Transparency for public works.  A new Transparency for infrastructure projects as a whole.  All in the light.  No more delays and under-the-table transactions.  No more project swamps.  No more darkness that means oxygen to corruption.  We want oxygen to transparency, not corruption.
