Unfortunately, it seems that not all politicians feel this debt and not all political forces.  Some continue to live with the stress of the image.  With the obsession of communication and propaganda, even in the most difficult moments.  Some people don't seem to understand that people are not looking for ministers to pretend to be train drivers.  But for prime ministers who will stop pretending to be clueless. It is therefore our duty to talk seriously about the essence of the problem.  Talk about immediate and radical solutions.  Not to pull out of the chest wishful thinking.
