 That is why it is urgent to restore today a sense of security and justice everywhere.  For the security that every citizen who lives, works and travels in this country must feel.  For the justice that must govern the operation of the state, the management of the Greek taxpayer's money on the path of transparency and the defence of the public interest. So, in this logic, the proposal that we are putting forward today for the operation of critical sectors of the administration and critical infrastructure, introduces another logic in the operation of the state itself.  The logic of transparency.  Transparency in the licensing and execution of public works, in the operation of control mechanisms, in the establishment and compliance with specifications, in the application of minimum safe operation rates for each public infrastructure.
