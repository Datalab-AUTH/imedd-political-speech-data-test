We say that our goal is to increase wages. Is it a realistic goal to raise the basic wage to 880 euros and to introduce an annual indexation so that every year if inflation goes up, the wage goes up?   Is it a realistic goal to increase after 14 years, by 10% as much as inflation, the salary of civil servants? We say that, yes, it is a realistic goal and it can be done. The economy can afford it, the public funds can afford it. And not only is it a realistic goal because it will relieve thousands of families, but also because it will revitalise the market and give new opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises, the middle class and professionals.
