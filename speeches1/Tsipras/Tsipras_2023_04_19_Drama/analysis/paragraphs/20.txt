Someone shouted "pensions". Let me also say about pensions, let me also say about your pain. Is it justice that in these four years they have taken 7 billion from pensioners, the 13th pension which they cut and abolished, while promising to keep it, and not giving the retroactive payments decided by the Council of State?  Is it justice not to comply with the decisions of the judiciary on pensioners? The CoE decided.
