We have had and still have the thousands of unemployed young people looking for hope and a way out. But of course, we also had the repeated tragedies - let's not forget that - 36,000 of our fellow citizens died during the pandemic. Some people were celebrating at the beginning that we were supposedly the best country. And in the end, we ended up having the worst number of deaths of our fellow citizens in proportion to our population in the whole western world. And of course we also had the unspeakable tragedy that made us all say "enough is enough", with this dramatic accident, the tragedy of Tempe.  So everything that we have lived through these four years and everything that we are living through, makes what we call political change imperative. So I want to send a message from here, from your beautiful city, from Drama: On May 21, this drama that the Greek people are living must end.
