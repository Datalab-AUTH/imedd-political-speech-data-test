  That is why every time I speak, and I will do so from here today, from Drama, I invite Mr. Mitsotakis, since he says so much that the dilemma of the ballot box is "Tsipras or Mitsotakis", he should not be so afraid to meet me and confront me. To discuss the big problems of the country, to let the citizens know what each one stands for, what each one believes, what each one has a plan.   So, I want to tell you our plan today as briefly as I can. In four axes, in four phrases. What does a vote for SYRIZA mean? A vote for SYRIZA means: Wage increase. Price reduction. Debt settlement.
