And today, of course, all those people, who at that time were talking big and pretending to be super-patriots, are nowadays praising our policy and they are right to do so.   But I ask myself, where are those of our fellow citizens who were then carried away, where are they to see the false words, the big words, to judge and compare?   So, citizens of Drama, I want to say in a nutshell that this Prime Minister, who in all critical matters knew nothing, turns out to be a Prime Minister who must be judged untranslatable. Since he did not know, he does not know, to be judged unelectable by the vote of the Greek people in the elections of May 21. To find out which country he ruled and where he led it.
