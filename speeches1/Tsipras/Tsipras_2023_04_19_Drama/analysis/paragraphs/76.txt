  And of course, because the Armed Forces of our country are also a state, we must give the men and women of the Armed Forces the respect, dignity and pay that their vital role in protecting the homeland demands.   And while I was talking about the Armed Forces, let me also remember something that concerns our national issues in a broader sense and that has seen the light of day again today. A year ago, if you remember, we were all surprised to see this Turkish advertising campaign for the Aegean Sea, which was called "Turkaegean". The unprepared Mitsotakis government then told us again that an official was to blame - every time an official is to blame. One official was to blame for the Tempi, one official was also to blame for the "Turkaegean".  And of course he promised us that he would do everything to stop this campaign and to revoke the "Turkaegean" trademark. This year, not only has this trademark not been withdrawn, but Turkey is regularly advertising the "Turkish-Gaek" all over the world. After the American press, yesterday we saw this campaign in the French Le Monde!
