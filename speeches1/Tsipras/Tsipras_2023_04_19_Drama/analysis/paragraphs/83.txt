We want to take a fresh look at the county's health and safety structures. The General Hospital is in a very poor state and immediate measures will be required to staff and upgrade its services. Also, we will not allow the two University Schools of Drama, the School of Forestry and Natural Environment and the School of Agricultural Biotechnology and Oenology, to be closed down. On the contrary, by abolishing the minimum admission base and supplementing their staff, these schools will be upgraded and students will come and the students will, as you know, give a different breath of life to the city as well. Finally, the frequency of industrial accidents in the Marble Quarries requires the creation of a Quarry Inspection Office based in Drama, with the aim and task of protecting the safety and life of workers.
