   So is this justice? Is it fair that civil servants have not seen a raise for 14 whole years and, at the same time, the blue party army enjoys astronomical salaries, that the managers in all the public utilities have tripled and have pay rises?  Is it justice for the economy, for society, for the country, to abolish the 8-hour week, to abolish unpaid overtime, to abolish all labour protection?  Is there any kind of justice, or perspective, when the prices I described earlier on electricity, at the supermarket, have gone to God and income is wiped out in the first three weeks of the month? At the same time, look, the now privatized PPC and the energy providers have made billions in excess profits over the years.  So I don't think that's justice.
