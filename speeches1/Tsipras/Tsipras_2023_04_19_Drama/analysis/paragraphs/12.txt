I don't want to make light of the situation, because the situation is dramatic. And I want to say that in addition to this harsh reality, we also have the regularity of labour insecurity, we have black labour and the jungle regime. We had things that I don't believe can happen in a European democracy in 2023.  We had this miserable abuse of the rule of law with the wiretapping, with the surveillance of half the political system in the office next door to Mr. Mitsotakis.
