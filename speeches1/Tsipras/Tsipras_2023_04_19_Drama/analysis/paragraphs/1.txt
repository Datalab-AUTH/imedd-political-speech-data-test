Hello! Thank you very much for the welcome, I am very happy to be here in Drama. After a very long time I am here in Drama and I am happy every time I am here, in your beautiful city.  This time my joy is greater, because I am here a few days before a great, glorious day that we all look forward to. We had the Feast of Tabernacles a few days ago, but we will have another glorious day, a resurrection day for our people: May 21! 33 days from today!
