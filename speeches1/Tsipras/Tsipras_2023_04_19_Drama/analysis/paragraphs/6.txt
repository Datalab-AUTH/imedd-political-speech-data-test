However, I want to say a few words about this harsh reality that we have all been living these four years.  In these four years we have seen incomes shrink, we have seen electricity, fuel and supermarket prices soar. We have seen obscenity legitimised. We have seen corruption being legitimised, the so-called "Patsis" - Patsis was a member of the ruling party - who did what: He was a crow and he was going to hit the auctions, taking people's houses. So we see corruption being legalised, we see looting being legalised, we see the invasion of public funds being legalised with closed tenders and direct awards. We see the humiliation of the middle class, the insecurity of the middle class being consolidated.  Do you remember what they were saying?
