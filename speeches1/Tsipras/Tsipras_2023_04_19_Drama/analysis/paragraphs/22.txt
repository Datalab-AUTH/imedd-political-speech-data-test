What is being attempted in the country in these four years is a generous redistribution of income. From the middle to the powerful. And now, a huge redistribution of wealth is expected. How is income redistribution done? Keeping indirect taxes, that is Value Added Tax, VAT, as well as high and Special Consumption Tax, at high prices, while inflation has exceeded 10, 12, food is now 14%.  What's wrong with that? There is a state obscenity, so to speak.
