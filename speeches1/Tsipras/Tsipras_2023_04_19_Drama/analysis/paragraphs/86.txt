And let me tell you something else: The difference between us and '15 is two words: And we know and we can. Why I say this: Because we have learned from our mistakes. We know how something can be done. And we know what is not being done. So, you don't have to give your strength for things that can't be won. But we know which ones are won and how they are won. And we can because for the first time, I repeat, we will be able to implement our programme without the constraints of the memoranda and the Troika.
