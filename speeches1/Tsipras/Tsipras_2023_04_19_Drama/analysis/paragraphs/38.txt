We handed over a country on our northern border that is not called Macedonia as it was called before, but North Macedonia. And Greek warplanes guarding its airspace. What would this country be today if we did not perform our patriotic duty? It would be a country like Libya in the south, a Libya on our northern border where third countries, especially Turkey, would play a central role.   And imagine at the moment when even the Nordic countries want to join NATO, what kind of pressure would be put on whichever government would be in power today, that country to join NATO with its constitutional name, which was then "Macedonia".   That's what we did back then, when the "vasta Sch√§uble" told us that we were supposedly trading Macedonia for pensions.
