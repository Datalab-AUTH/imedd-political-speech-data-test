And we see today a reality that is crushing us. And the average citizen, I believe, regardless of what he voted for in '19, regardless of his political beliefs, believes one thing, feels one thing, speaks one thing, he says: That's it. So much for corruption, so much for accuracy, so much for insecurity, so much for family rule, so much for the viciousness of the regime, so much for injustice. So that is why we believe that this "so far" can be made out of anger and indignation, a political dynamic of change, through the victory of SYRIZA.  I want, citizens of Drama, friends, to describe, as much as I can, the situation we are experiencing. Although I think that since we all experience them, descriptions are superfluous.
