Is it realistic to give? We say it is realistic.   Look, friends, let me tell you something: We governed in the most difficult time the economy and the country has ever faced since the post-war period. With the country bankrupt, broken, we were forced to clean up the mess left by other governments, not by us. We didn't create this state, the state with buffet, with corruption, with corruption, with corruption. We did not create this national debt. We have been in the most difficult times for the Greek economy and the country.
