 And we will do everything we can, armed with the truth and with arguments and with sober political discourse, not with toxicity, not with communication politics, not with propaganda, not with slogans, but with arguments, we will do everything possible to end it. And it will end if citizens all realize the power they have in their hands.  Because the weapon of our political opponents, do you know what it is? It is not the weapon of our opponents that they are honest, but that they are all the same, dishonest. It is not the weapon of our political opponents that they have done well, but that they can't do better, it doesn't change anything.  Well, we have to convince the citizens, and especially the young people who have a lot of power in their hands, the power of the vote, that they are not all the same. That we have been judged, that we are not all dishonest in politics, that we didn't all get into politics to make fortunes, that we don't all have off-shore, that we don't all live lavishly. And above all, to convince them that things can change. Not to make miracles, because miracles don't happen.
