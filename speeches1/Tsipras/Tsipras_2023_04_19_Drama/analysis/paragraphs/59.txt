Because with the protection of the first home, of professional housing and agricultural land, with transparency, taxation and control over the action and transactions of funds, a framework can be put in place. The 120 instalments and the cancellation of part of the nominal value of the debt can be introduced, as we did for the debts to the Insurance Funds of freelancers in 2018.   And of course, I want to tell you, and it has a value both symbolic and substantial, that this plan that we presented about 20 days ago, for housing protection and regulations, to put a framework in place for the operation of funds and to have a big write-off of the face value of the debt based on our experience, because you know, funds come in and buy a debt for a house that is in mortgage at 20% of the value. And they go to sell it at auction to get 80%, 90%, 100%. This is called obscenity.
