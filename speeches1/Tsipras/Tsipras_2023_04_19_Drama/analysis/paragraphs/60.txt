So I want to say that it has a symbolic and substantial value, that this plan that we presented a few days ago, has the signature of the politician who put her name on the protection of the first home during the period of the memoranda, Lucas Katseli.   I must also tell you that it is realistic and we will achieve it, just as it is realistic and we will also achieve it to have a public pillar in the banking system, the National Bank, which we do not want to leave workers on the street, as happened here with Olympus Bank, but we want it to support the real economy, small and medium-sized enterprises.   Is a new NHS also, friends, a realistic goal? Dignity pay for people standing on the front line? I know you are hurting, that's why I say that, we are hurting all over Greece. Because everything that has been standing still in the NHS has been dismantled over these four years. I know them very well.
