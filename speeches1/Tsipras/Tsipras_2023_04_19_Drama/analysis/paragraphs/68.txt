And that's why I also say that since we have succeeded in these difficult circumstances, isn't it realistic to succeed now that the country is out of the memoranda, that there will be no constraints, that we will have the freedom to follow our own policy?   So, when people tell us that Syriza wants a second chance, I tell them: You are wrong, we don't want a second chance, we want the first chance to govern on the basis of our programme. To govern on the basis of our plan and not on the constraints of the Troika and the memoranda. And you know, they won't then be able to, if we're going to govern without coercion, they won't then be able to beg and say "hold it, Schäuble", there will be no Schäuble to hold.
