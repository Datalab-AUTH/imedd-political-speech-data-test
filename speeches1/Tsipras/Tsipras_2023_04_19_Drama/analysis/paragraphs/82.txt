The construction of the Egnatia Railway, which will connect the ports of Thessaloniki, Kavala and Alexandroupolis, leaves out two major urban centres, Serres and Drama. We are committed to a redesign of the layout based on technical and scientific criteria, so that the Egnatia Railway meets the needs of your region. At the same time, we have to look at the health structures from the beginning, what someone in the audience said to me, that you have to pay a lot of money every time you go to Thessaloniki, to a hospital in Thessaloniki. This is unthinkable, it is unacceptable.
