Mitsotakis, he managed to register two trademarks: -Turkaegean to advertise Turkey.   -The spoon for his government.   But we, I will say it again, in 2015 we took over a country on our northern border that everyone called "Macedonia" and today everyone calls it "North Macedonia". In 2019 we handed over the Macedonian solution, taking back our name, our symbols, our history.   In 2019 they took over the Aegean from us. In 2023, we warn them, we will not receive a Turkish army - we will not tolerate a Turkish army.   This history of incompetence, of uselessness, which has been presented to us as excellence, ends definitively on May 21.
