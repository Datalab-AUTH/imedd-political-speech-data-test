Drama, friends, we believe that it can and must cease to be a poor relative of the Greek territory. This is our goal, this is our commitment. we can implement it with your contribution and your help. Citizens of Drama, friends, in general I have tried to present to you our "wants", I have tried to present to you our plan, our vision. I believe that these are our "wants", today they are also the "wants" of every citizen who is sensible and sensitive. But often, in the cities and neighbourhoods I visit, I am called upon to answer a question. They tell me: Okay, we know what you want and we're sure you're telling the truth, that's what you want to do. But can you? Can you stand up to big interests, to ruthless profiteers, to decades of ills that are considered the norm, and indeed the stereotype has been created that this norm is not changing?
