  So Greece has to get rid of this regime before it is too late and before the country is driven to new economic and social tragedies.   There is, I believe, not a single Greek who does not understand that the frightening widening of inequalities, corruption, deliberate ignorance, incompetence and familism, partisanship and contempt for the majority cannot herald anything positive, nothing good.   Opposition to these policies is building up in our society. Outrage at scandals, at corruption, at injustice.  It is this opposition, this indignation, this anger, that we say must become a force for change. Power of justice.   And with the vote on 21 May we can do it.
