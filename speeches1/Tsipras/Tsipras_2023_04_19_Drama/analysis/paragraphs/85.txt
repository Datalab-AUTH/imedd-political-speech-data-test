And I want to reverse the question to you today: what do you say? Can we?  Well, I'm going to surprise you and prove you wrong: Alone, we cannot.  With you we can! Only if you, and all of you, all of us, together, are on the front line then yes, we can. So the answer is not "yes, we can", the answer is "you can". You can bring SYRIZA to the first place in the May 21 elections, you can, with your vote and your struggle, give strength, a driving force in our effort to bring justice everywhere.
