 There are no impregnable castles for us. Castles are to be conquered. I am sure that Drama, 33 days from today, will give a strong message about what it needs, what it seeks, what I feel wherever I am, in any city, in any neighbourhood, what I understand that people want today: A meaningful change in their lives, a big change.  And of course, it's not just the change of government that will bring this about. The prerequisite is not a change of government, but a change of policies. So we want this milestone, the 21st of May, to give a perspective of hope for the country. To bring with the vote of the Greek people in the country, the political change, the victory of SYRIZA in the elections, which is a prerequisite for political change and the formation of a progressive coalition government on the next day of the elections, to bring back what?
