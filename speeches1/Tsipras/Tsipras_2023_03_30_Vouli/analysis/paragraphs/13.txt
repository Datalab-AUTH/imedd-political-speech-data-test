However, you were not ashamed and did not hesitate to put on a show in front of the cameras for the non-existent telecommunications in Larissa, in front of a local control panel that the minister wanted to call it telecommunications, but the worker himself told the truth and said it many times, contradicting in a humiliating way in a live broadcast the minister himself.  Just as you were not ashamed and did not hesitate in an alleged show of force to remove the president of the OSE, but in his place to put a man who was an external adviser to the OSE on issues of signalling telecommunications, that is, the one that did not exist at the scene of the accident.  It was non-existent from 2019 and in four years, because you are a four-year government, it was never restored. Do you know to the average citizen what this sequence of events says.  It says that you first share the clothes of the state and then you share the responsibilities for this state, but your state, the executive state, or whatever you call it each time.
