 This in my opinion is disrespectful.  It's disrespectful to the people we lost and their relatives.  But I would say that it reflects even in terms of symbolism four years of governance in one moment.  Even worse, I would say that in these four years of one crisis after another, we have a government that baptizes the great wounds in the body of Greek society as inevitable, as imported.  And even worse, the unjust loss of fifty-seven of our fellow human beings, including many young children, as a "sacrifice" and the crises that came as an "opportunity".  And the question is: Sacrifice for whom.  Opportunity for whom.  For whom so many people, including young children, were sacrificed.  And for whom were all these crises that we have gone through in recent years, the pandemic, the energy crisis, the poverty crisis.  An opportunity for the few to amass their wealth and an opportunity for more buffets, favours and strengthening of the party state.
