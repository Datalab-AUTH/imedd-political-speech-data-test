 Why the fatal stationmaster was illegally appointed.  Why the minister with a photographic ministerial decision came afterwards five days after the appointment to legalize it.  Why were unqualified and untrained stationmasters placed in critical positions, for which the Regulatory Authority asks to be recalled from positions of responsibility today.  Why in the summer of 2019 there were one thousand two hundred permanent employees in OSE, twenty-five stationmasters in Larissa and today there are only seven hundred and fifty in OSE and only ten stationmasters in Larissa.  Why the GSM-R system, which had been fully delivered and staff fully trained in its use by 2019, four years later is still not operational.
