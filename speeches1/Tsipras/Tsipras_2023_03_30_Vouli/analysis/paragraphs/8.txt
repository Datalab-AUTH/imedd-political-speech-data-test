 The easy excuse for Mr.  Mitsotakis, who should be here today, should be in Parliament - I don't know if the fact that he has announced the date of the elections means that he will not be back in Parliament - not only in the accident, four years now in all the difficult things, is that he has no responsibility, is that he does not know the crucial facts, he did not know.  He didn't know that outside of intensive care units, intubated patients die.  He did not know that his nephew set up a parastatal inside the Maximos building to monitor half of the political system.  He didn't know that his minister had appointed Mr.  Lignadi.
