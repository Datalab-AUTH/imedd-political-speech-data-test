 The truth is, therefore, the obligation of all of us.  That is why, as far as we are concerned, we have tried - and I think you have all seen this from the beginning - not to raise our finger in the critical hours of mourning in particular, not to raise our voice, but we have tried from the beginning to put the real causes, the strategic mistakes and omissions in the public debate.  We have not made the accident an arena for debate, but we have taken on our duty to do what is necessary as a state to prevent such horrors from happening again.  And now we intervene so that anger does not become a force for levelling, but becomes a force for truth and justice.
