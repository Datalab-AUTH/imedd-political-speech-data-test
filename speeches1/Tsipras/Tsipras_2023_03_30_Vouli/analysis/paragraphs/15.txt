 Greek society can no longer tolerate this tactic of cover-up and the only way we have to proceed collectively, I would say as a political system, is the way of truth, to answer the "why" and then go to the "how".  How we will have safe transport, how systems and public infrastructure should work, how we will set up control and oversight mechanisms, how the life of each and every person will count first and foremost.  But let's first answer the "why" before we get to the "how".  I have the feeling that for a month now there is no desire to answer the "why".  For a month now, almost everything has gone unanswered.  And the government has to answer these crucial "why" and as long as it does not answer them, its choice to go without answers to these crucial "why" in the election ahead of us, obliges all of us, those of us who will be in the next Parliament - many of the MPs of New Democracy, the ruling party today, will not be, will not be over sixty with any result, that is what the simple proportional representation defines - but those of us who will be in the next Parliament have an obligation to answer.  And we have an obligation to answer not only to the people we have lost, but I repeat to the whole Greek society the "why".
