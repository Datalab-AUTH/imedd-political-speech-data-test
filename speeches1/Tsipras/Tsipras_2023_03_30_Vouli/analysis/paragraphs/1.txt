I asked to speak on this bill today, not obviously to compete in toxicity and divisive political discourse with government ministers who have been on this House these two days, but because I think today in this bill we are called upon primarily to talk about a great wound, the great wound that opened a month ago in Tempe. We are called upon to speak with respect and sensitivity, because this wound is still open.  It is not closed for the fifty-seven families who lost their people, but it is not closed for any of us, I believe, for the whole of Greek society.  The need for respect and sensitivity becomes a hundred times more urgent when the universal mourning, as the days pass, turns into a universal anger and a universal demand for truth and justice.  This is what the grieving families are demanding today, this is what the young people who have been demonstrating for days in all the cities of our country, especially in the big cities, facing the chemicals and tear gas, this is what I believe the whole of Greek society is demanding.
