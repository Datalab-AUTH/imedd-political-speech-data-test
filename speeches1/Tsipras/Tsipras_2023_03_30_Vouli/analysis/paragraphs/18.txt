 Why did the Minister not respond to the continuous and repeated letters of the workers, who were asking for safety and predicting the fatality.  Because the OSE-TRAINOSE contract, which initially provided for the obligation for 600 million investments by the Italian company and the obligation of the State to proceed with the safety projects, was finally brought to this Chamber and passed by the parliamentary majority, but without either the 600 million or the obligation for the safety projects. In these "why", ladies and gentlemen, lies the truth.  And we have a responsibility to answer these "why" questions.  Because if we do not answer them, there can be neither justice for today nor security for tomorrow.  If we don't answer them, we will be hiding behind the long-standing pathologies of a state that you created, maintained, shared and exploited in all possible ways, in order to finally reach the last rung of the ladder, the ladder of evil, when you decided to baptize its inefficiency as executive, its inefficiency as excellence, its family rule, its bureaucracy, its bribery, its corruption and its protection, the dismantling of every public structure on the altar of speculation and obscenity. But here we are, I think the last red line has been crossed.
