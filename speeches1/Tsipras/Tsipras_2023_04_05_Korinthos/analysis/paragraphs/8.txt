They will the pensioners that supposedly they should not appeal, because what they get those who appealed will get the others and especially the gifts and supplementary pensions are not taken by anyone, add up the 4 years how much it costs to cut the thirteenth and the non-reimbursement of retroactive payments is 7 billion euros.  7 billion less pensioner cheated middle class.
