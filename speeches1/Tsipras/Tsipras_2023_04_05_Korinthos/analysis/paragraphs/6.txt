 Here's the world of impaired perception I saw the other day.  How they tried to set up an amateur way.  Another tribal camera show with the restart of the railroad a month after the tragic accident of the temps and they got to the point of dressing up as alleged passengers.  The executives of New Democracy, who joined the people who were in this fiasco show at the Larissa station to show that there is supposedly a TV station, while it was an antiquated console, the same people pretend to be passengers and tell them how safe we feel for so stupidly passing citizens, I don't know if these tips.  We give them American Communicators.  I don't know if they pass Greek citizens off as Americans to chicken shit expression.  I want to remember.  An action of a not sociologist, but a great American politician blog.
