 Mass for fascism is the yeast against intolerance.  The battle against misanthropy is not won by decrees, and not only by decrees that are perforated and unconstitutional.  It is won through a daily struggle, it is won in the spaces of everyday life, where we have to create a network of solidarity and support for the weakest, a network of solidarity and support for the different and that we want a pluralistic society, a democratic society, a society where everyone is equal, so.  Our struggle for justice is a struggle that has perspective, comes from far away and will go far away.  This place has always been a place where the conquests of the people lead to more justice and more democracy.  On the 21st of May we strike.
