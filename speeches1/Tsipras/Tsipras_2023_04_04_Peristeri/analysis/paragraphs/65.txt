 I want to report today.  And in the cases of our fellow citizens, more than 70. 000 borrowers.  Who took out mortgages in Swiss francs.  And they found themselves with exorbitant charges after the unlocking of the exchange rate, charges up to 3 times the amount they borrowed.  Justice for these citizens means legislation to protect their first home and to settle their debt in a sustainable way, taking into account the exchange rate at the time they received the loan and the amount they have already repaid.
