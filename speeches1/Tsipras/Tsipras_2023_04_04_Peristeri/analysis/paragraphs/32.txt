 We are creating a Deputy Ministry of Finance.  With exclusive responsibility for the management of private debt and housing policy.  We do this so that there is speed and efficiency in taking immediate action.  Bringing together responsibilities for the implementation of comprehensive and integrated policies to address this horizontal problem for society.
