 Second, let's see who's concerned.  We are talking about any natural person.  With or without bankruptcy capacity who has become permanently and generally insolvent and is in default of payment of arrears.  Therefore, any citizen who has found himself in such an unfortunate situation.  He has the right to request the adjustment of his debts and thus immediately protect his first home, his business premises and his agricultural land from forced liquidation.  The conditions are simple and self-evident, with no loopholes for exclusions.
