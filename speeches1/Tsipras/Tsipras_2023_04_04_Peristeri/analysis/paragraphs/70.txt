 This proposal, this plan.  The first legislative intervention of the country's new progressive government.  This is our goal.  And against this proposal against this goal we call on all citizens, all institutions and all progressive forces to take a stand.  We want and we can turn the page on May 29 and bring justice back to this land.  The suffocating society needs it, the middle class that has been deceived.  The weak who are seeing the last 4 years become increasingly weak justice.  So be well everywhere.
