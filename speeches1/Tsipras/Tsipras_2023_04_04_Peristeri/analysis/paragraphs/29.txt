 From scratch to get to the proposal we will present today.  We already have a lot of work behind us.  I recall that in April 21 we put forward the framework for a permanent and comprehensive private debt management plan.  With protection of the main residence and other critical assets to replace the government's bankruptcy law.  The proposal concerns exceptional measures to regulate the pandemic debt, but also a permanent framework structured around 3 main pillars: businesses, households and public debt.  I also recall that last July.
