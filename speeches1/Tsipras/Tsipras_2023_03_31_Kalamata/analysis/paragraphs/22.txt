 They care about themselves, they care about the interests with which they are intertwined, they care about state officials.  They care about the appropriation of public funds, they care about the cover-up but not for the many, not for the citizens of this country.  We lived the drama of the pandemic.  Tens of thousands of people who could have been saved perished.   We are told that the pandemic is a global phenomenon.  But what they didn't tell us is why Greece was in the first place in terms of deaths in population ratio in the whole western world. Why they didn't strengthen the NHS and its people also they didn't tell us.  Why, instead of strengthening the NHS and its people, they have dismantled the NHS and are organising the invasion of the NHS by speculation.  We have lived and we are still living today, the energy crisis, the crisis of price stability.
