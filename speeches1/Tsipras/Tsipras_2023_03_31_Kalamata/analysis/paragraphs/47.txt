 So our plan is to raise wages, lower prices, regulate debts and have an efficient state.  And it seeks to support the middle class by redressing the injustices against it.  It seeks to support the forces of production so that Greece can produce more wealth, but distributed to the whole of Greek society, without leaving those who produce the wealth on the sidelines.  We aim to change the production model.  Invest in human capital, in highly qualified young scientists.  Humane and modern working conditions and pay for all workers. We aim to boost healthy entrepreneurship and investment in strategic sectors of the economy.
