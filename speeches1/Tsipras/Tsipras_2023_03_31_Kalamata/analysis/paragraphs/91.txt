 Above all, no one is holding us, no one has us in their pocket, nothing is holding us, only the vision and the program of justice.   That's the only thing that keeps us.  Only our voters, only the ordinary people.  The problems of the people we want to solve.  So for all these reasons, I believe that we can and we want to and we will succeed.  We will achieve this great victory.  We will bring the much-needed change to the country. On May 22, a new day will dawn for the country.
