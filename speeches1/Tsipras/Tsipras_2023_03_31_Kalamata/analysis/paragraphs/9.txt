Because one month after this unspeakable tragedy, dramatic questions still hover over Greek society: why the telecommunications centre in Larissa, which was destroyed by a fire in July 2019, remains almost 4 years old.  If only this had worked, the tragedy would have been avoided.  Why they broke the law to appoint the fatal stationmaster.  Why did the Minister, with a photographic ministerial decision, come afterwards, five days after the appointment, to make him permanent?  Why were unqualified and untrained station masters placed in critical positions.  Because in the summer of '19 there were 1. 200 permanent employees in OSE and especially in Larissa 25 stationmasters and today there are only 750 employees in OSE and only 10 stationmasters in Larissa.  Because the GSM-R system, which had been fully delivered, which enables telecommunications between trains and stations, had been fully delivered and staff fully trained to use it by 2019, 4 years later it is still not operational.
