 What they told you all these years, do you remember.  That it was SYRIZA who butchered you.  13 consecutive reductions made by the Samaras government, they forgot about them.  And what did they say to you at the end, when we resisted the terrible pressures of the Troika and the institutions and did not cut a single euro?  That we swapped pensions for Macedonia, that's what they said, that's what their miserable propaganda said.  When we took the decision to defend our national interest, when we took the decision to close a major wound in our foreign policy. And today, with everything that is happening around us, the war in Ukraine, the pressures that even the Scandinavian countries want to join NATO, what would happen today if we did not solve this issue in a fair and privileged way for the country?  Why was our ancient cultural heritage recognized, why are Greek F-16s flying over the airspace of our neighbours today?
