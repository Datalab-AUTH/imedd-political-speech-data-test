 But we will win this difficult battle, the battle for change with justice in our country.   And we will win it together with the people, without their strength, you know, no project can succeed. Because, I say it many times, no matter what city in the country I find myself in, change is all of you, change is each of us.  Change is the worker, the unemployed, the young, the small and medium-sized, the farmer, the pensioner, who is demanding a better tomorrow.  Change is the people who produce and create with their hands, their minds, their entrepreneurship, their sensitivity.   The change is all those who with responsibility and determination will go to the polls on May 21, to say the big NO to the regime that has dynastized Greece for the last four years and to say the big YES to SYRIZA Progressive Alliance, for a progressive government that will change the country.
