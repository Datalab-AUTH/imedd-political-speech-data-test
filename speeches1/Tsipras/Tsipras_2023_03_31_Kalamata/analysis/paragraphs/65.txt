 But we want to create conditions of justice for mothers too.  And that for us means: Increase and conversion of the child benefit into a mother's allowance and granting it to the mother from the birth of the child until the age of 24, regardless of her studies. Justice for mothers, it means special maternity leave for self-employed women, freelancers and farmers and above all it means, and this is for young couples, nurseries for all children This means justice for young couples and especially young women, young mothers.  But justice for young couples means more than that.  It means affordable housing with low rents through the creation of a housing bank and the control of Airbnb.  Means doubling the rent allowance.
