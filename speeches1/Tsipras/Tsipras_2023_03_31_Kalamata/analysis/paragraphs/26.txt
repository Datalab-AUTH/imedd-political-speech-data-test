This is, unfortunately, the Greece of Mr.  Mitsotakis.  Greece of inexactness, corruption, anarchy, family rule, Greece of institutional collapse, Greece of injustice.  And this Greece does not deserve us.  Whatever we are, whatever we believe, we don't deserve.  Whether we are left-wing, centrist or right-wing, this Greece does not deserve us.  I said it this morning in Argos.
