 They are the ones we want to support, they are the ones we trust, they are the ones we will give space to.  With them we will break the abscess of the dependence of the judiciary on the executive.  With them we will restore the sense of justice, the sense of trust of citizens in the institutions. This is our vision, citizens of Kalamata, for Greece.  To become a proper European rule of law, the citizen to know that he can find his right.  Where injustice will not be the rule, but justice.  And this will reflect every aspect of life and everyday life, in every single sector and in every single place.  Because you know, inequalities do not only exist between social groups, but also between the centre and the periphery.  Widening geographical disparities.
