 Increase in the number of admissions to universities with the abolition of the Minimum Base and free access to low-demand schools. I want to leave last in this attempt to explain our motto, what justice in the state means, because it is also timely after what we have seen in front of us lately.  Justice in the state means: Replacing the so-called executive state with a democratic, efficient and just state.  With meritocracy and transparency structures.  With a drastic limitation of secondments and direct assignments.  Above all, it means an end to the party-appointed inappropriate station masters, the golden boys, the blue ones in the Public Organizations with the fat salaries.
