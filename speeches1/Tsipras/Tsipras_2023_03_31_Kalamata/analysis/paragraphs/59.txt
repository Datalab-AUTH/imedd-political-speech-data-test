 This is not tolerable, it cannot be tolerated by Banks that are alive, because the Greek taxpayer has given his blood to be alive.  With three recapitalisations and the so-called deferred tax.  So, what we are clearly saying that we are going to introduce is an extraordinary tax for the banks in order to raise the money needed to support consumers who currently have a variable rate loan. And at the same time we will legislate to implement substantial regulations - a breathing space for borrowers.   We will also not allow the full privatisation of the National Bank.  Because we aim to transform the National Bank into what its name says: National Bank.  Public pillar of the banking system.  So we will prevent harmonized practices, we will direct financial instruments to the real economy, on the basis of the national development strategy, we will implement a public interest oriented policy for the management of red loans, and we will establish a specific regulatory framework for the transparency of banking transactions and for the operation of the so-called Claims Management Companies, the so-called servicers who are currently chasing citizens to eat their marrow and to make auctions. Because fairness in the economy, my friends, means that everyone should have access to bank finance, not just the big and powerful.  Today, 96% of businesses in our country, small and medium-sized enterprises, cannot even pass through a banking institution.
