 We want a state next to the citizen, at the service of the citizen.  That engenders trust and security.  We also want a Greek Police that fights crime and not collaborates with crime.  That is why we will proceed immediately to reorganize, democratize and cleanse the Greek Police from sworn officers. And we want a transparent and democratic NSA that deals with national security and the fight against organised crime.  And not for half the political system to listen.  We want an NSA to pursue Greekmafia, not to be run by Greekmafia as has been the case for the last 4 years with Mr.  Mitsotakis.
