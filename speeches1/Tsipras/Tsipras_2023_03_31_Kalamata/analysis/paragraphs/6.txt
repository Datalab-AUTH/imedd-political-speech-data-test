 All the ugliness of the state, which was advertised as an executive, supposedly, met in the valley of Tempe with dramatic consequences.   The dismantling of the public sector and every structure for the protection of people, the insistence on blurred agreements for the speculation of big interests, partisanship, corruption, bribery, bribe-taking, the indifference not only to the everyday life of ordinary people, but also to life itself. This unspeakable tragedy is not a matter for electoral exploitation.  And that's why you will have seen that we, unlike what was done at that time in other times when we had dramatic events again, did not attempt to make a toxic discourse on the death of 57 people.  We are different we are not the same, we are of another quality we are.  This is not a matter for electoral exploitation.
