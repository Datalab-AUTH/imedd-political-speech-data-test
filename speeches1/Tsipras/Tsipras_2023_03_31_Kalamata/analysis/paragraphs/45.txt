 Our national plan seeks to put the country back on the path of European normality.  Note the irony, those who were demonstrating saying "we are staying in Europe" are the ones who have led the country today miles away from what Europe means.  Why Europe means above all the rule of law. So what we want to do is to make Greece, to make Greece a normal European country again.  Fighting glaring inequalities.  With a slogan that I think you will also like, because it's catchy, short, simple and to the point.
