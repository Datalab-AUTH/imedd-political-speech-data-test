 We have those people, with vision and with experience, they may not come from political firesides like most of our political opponents, they may not be princes, but they are people of real society, of work and creation. But that's why they can understand, they can feel society.  They do not live elsewhere.  We don't live elsewhere, we live here.  We live in this society and in this society we are only accountable.  No one else.
