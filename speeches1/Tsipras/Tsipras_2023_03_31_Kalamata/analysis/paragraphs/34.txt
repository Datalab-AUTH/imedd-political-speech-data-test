 That's why the day after the elections, regardless of which party we belong to, regardless of what ideas we have, we have to see what day will dawn on us.  If this government and this Prime Minister are given a mandate to renew their mandate, those who broke the rule of law with the wiretaps, those who destroyed the state itself with the buffets, those who organized this great plundering of wealth redistribution, what else will they do if they are completely unaccountable for another 4 years? It is therefore a national obligation and duty to fight together to keep society standing.  Let us all fight together for a great political change that will mean a change in our daily life, a change in our lives.  With more justice and prosperity for all.  And I believe that this Greece that is hurting us, we must and we can change it.  To defeat the perpetrators of economic and national decline.
