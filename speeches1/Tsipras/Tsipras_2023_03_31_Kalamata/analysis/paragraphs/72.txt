 Finally, justice in the state means control of all public spending, including arms spending. And I say this from here in Kalamata, where for 4 years now, New Democracy has achieved the following terrible thing: Tripling the cost of the Kalamata Air Training Center, it went up three times more than when we planned it.  So I say this to make it clear: We will not tolerate games with the defense of the country.  We will actively support the personnel of the Armed Forces, we will actively support the Greek Civilian Industry and we will control all the armament programs decided in the last three years.  Euro to euro.  Every euro of the Greek taxpayer for the defense of the country will strengthen the defense of the country and especially will strengthen the personnel of the Armed Forces, those who hold Thermopylae.
