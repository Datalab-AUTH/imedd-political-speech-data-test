 Mitsotakis has as his electoral goal self-reliance, and indeed identifies it with stability.  We, although we were the government at the time, knowingly gave up the privileges of enhanced proportional representation and it was we who enacted a law that leads to partnerships.  Why we believe in partnerships.  We believe that stability requires democratic consensus, and governments of the broadest popular support.   And not the arrogance and the authoritarianism and the uncontrollability of self-reliance.  After all, it was self-reliance that led us to bankruptcy.  Autonomous governments led us into bankruptcy.
