Thank you very much for the welcome.  It seems, it is destined from this stadium, from this city, from Kalamata, to take the first step towards the great victory, the first step towards the elections of May 21, which will bring political change and justice.  This is the message we are sending here today from Kalamata.  The message of determination and the message of hope.  The message that the progressive government that the country needs will become a reality in a few weeks from today.  With a clean front, with a clean political record, with clean proposals, with clean hands, we claim the vote of the Greek people to change the country.
