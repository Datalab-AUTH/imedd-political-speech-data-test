 Mitsotakis your city announces it, 4 years did nothing.  Well, and this will be a priority and we will make it a reality.  These are our commitments for your country.  And with these commitments, I believe that we will put a stone in the way of justice for your city and for your place and for Messinia.  Citizens of Kalamata and Messinia, I have attempted in this first, as things stand, meeting after the announcement of the date of the elections, to unfold our plan, to talk about our programme, about our commitments and to specify what justice means in every sector, in every aspect of everyday life, of our lives, but also what it means for your country.
