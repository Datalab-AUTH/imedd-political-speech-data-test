We will put an end to those obstacles that block the way, block young people, lock the doors of universities to thousands of young people and have led almost all the universities in the region to decline.  We will change, yes.  We will abolish the university police.  Why we want to appoint teachers in schools and not police officers.  Police officers will return to the neighbourhoods to protect against organised crime.
