And, of course, we will put an end to the downward spiral, the downward slide, the dismantling, the privatisation of the NHS.  Because without a strong NHS, there can be no sense of security in Greek society.  We will also put an end to the institutional devaluation of people of culture and the downgrading of their degrees.  The institutionalisation of the violation of the confidentiality of communications.  In violation of rights. But what's about ending the negative effects of the laws that have been passed over these four years, what's about what we're going to repeal, is only the first chapter in our plan.  Because the next, many more chapters are not about what to stop, what to permanently remove from our lives, but about what to create.  They have to do with what we build, they have to do with what we build.  And what we want to build is step by step to make our vision of justice everywhere a reality.  And let me tell you today, as succinctly as I can, what this vision that we have, what our vision means.  what justice means everywhere, what justice means in our everyday life, what can change in our lives. First of all, justice in society for us means and we will put it into practice from the very first days of the progressive government: immediate and drastic measures to fight against inexactness, to put an end to obscenity.
