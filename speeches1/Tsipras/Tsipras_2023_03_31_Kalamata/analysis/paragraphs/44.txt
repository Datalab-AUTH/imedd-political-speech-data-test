So today, from here, from Kalamata, which as I said at the beginning of my speech is significant, from here we started the great battle, the great political march for the great victory in 2015, from here we start today.  So from here, from Kalamata, I want to invite you all together to co-sign this national plan that the country needs, a national plan for the uplift and regeneration of our country.  And this plan has two words: JUSTICE EVERYWHERE.  It is the plan for the reconstruction of the state, it is the plan for the recovery of the economy, it is the plan for the strengthening of social protection, but also for the necessary breathing space for democracy itself.
