 We aim to protect the right to work, the right to housing, the right of every young person to quality education, the right of every pensioner to a decent pension, the right of every citizen to decent health care. Our national plan provides that as the first act of justice from the first days of progressive governance, we will abolish all those laws and regulations that put a barrier to the freedoms and rights of the citizen and remove any barrier to the impunity of the privileged.  We aim to immediately put an end to:The jungle labour regime. The plundering of the first home. On the criminal immunity of bank executives. Tax immunity for companies speculating in electricity, oil and essentials.
