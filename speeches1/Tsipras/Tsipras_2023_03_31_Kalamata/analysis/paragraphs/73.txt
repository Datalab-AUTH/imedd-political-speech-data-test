 All this, friends, is crucial, but justice everywhere without justice in justice, there can be no justice in justice.   And this is very critical. And justice in the judiciary means: strengthening its officials, but above all, its independence.  With a comprehensive plan to restore the relationship of trust between the judiciary and citizens.  Justice in Justice means speeding up the administration of justice, digitising it and improving its infrastructure.  But it also means cutting the umbilical cord between the judiciary and the executive. A few days ago in an interview with a television station, I was asked: "You don't trust the Supreme Court prosecutor, does that mean you don't trust the judiciary?".  And I replied: just as politics is not Tsipras, just as journalism is not Pretenderis - he was next to me - justice is not one man, justice is not the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court.  There are dozens, hundreds, of honest judges out there.
