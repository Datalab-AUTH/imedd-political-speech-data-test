 This is only the only way to change, for a long-lasting government with an unprecedented level of popular support.  It is also the only path to political and social stability.  The path of unity of our people in the common effort for the common good.  The right wing invokes the fact that the leaderships of the democratic parties refuse this prospect.  And this becomes an argument to convince not that a government working together for change is a negative development, but that it is an impossible development.  We answer: Why everyone declares what they declare, as they declare it, before the elections, trying to gain as much popular influence as possible, is understandable.  The election is a competitive process.  And that's fine.
