 Our ballot papers are renewed compared to 2019 by about 50%, and for the first time they implement an innovation: for the first time in the country they are 50% men, 50% women.  That is, for the first time we have gender equality on our ballots.  I am convinced, I may be unfair to the comrades in this Central Committee, but I am convinced that this will be passed on to the citizens' vote, that the vote will have the flavour of a woman.
