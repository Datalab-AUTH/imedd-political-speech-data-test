 I believe that this is perhaps the only time that the opposition has so thoroughly delved into programmatic positions.  Four years now, I remind you how many special presentations we have made, the last one, I think, was a very successful presentation on a critical issue, private debt and the auctions of first homes, commercial housing and agricultural land.  However, despite the fact that after the approval of the programme in principle, which we will do today, there should be immediate further elaboration, so that we can present publicly in a special event to the Greek people and in a way that is easy to understand and in a way that is easy to understand, this government programme.  I believe that this will be our great weapon in the electoral battle.  Therefore, in addition to the approval in principle, we should also authorize some comrades to proceed in consultation with the Political Secretariat, the Executive Bureau, in this elaboration.
