 So, yes, it is an opportunity for us.  And I would say that this is not the second chance, this is the first chance to govern under normal conditions, without memoranda and the Troika over our heads.  The opportunity to finally put into practice all those policies and the programme aimed at improving people's lives.  In democracy without asterisks.  To transparency, to an efficient and fair state and to justice everywhere, which is not only our motto, it is also our soul.
