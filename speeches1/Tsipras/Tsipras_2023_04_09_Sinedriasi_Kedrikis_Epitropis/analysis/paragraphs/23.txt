 Let me ask myself: If the result that we are asking for comes about, if the conditions are formed with a victory for Syriza and therefore the conditions are formed not only politically, morally, but also in terms of numbers that will give the possibility of forming a government of progressive forces, which leadership, which democratic party will be the one that will decide to ignore this will?  And I wonder again: Which leadership of which democratic party will be the one to decide to ignore this will of the people for the great political change?  Which leadership of which political party will be the one that will decide to bear the cost for the country, but also the cost for itself, of a series of electoral contests that New Democracy is seeking, but which will certainly not be positive for the Greek people.
