 But the ballot papers that we are asked to approve today, I believe, however, are the mirror of our relationship with society.  They reflect both "we want" and "we can" and of course they reflect what we proclaim and believe.  But also our commitment to ideas, principles and values, as well as the colourfulness that an electoral battle requires.  And the restless spirit of the young, but also the stability and wisdom of the old.  The multicultural origin of political origins, but above all the multicolour of social origins.
