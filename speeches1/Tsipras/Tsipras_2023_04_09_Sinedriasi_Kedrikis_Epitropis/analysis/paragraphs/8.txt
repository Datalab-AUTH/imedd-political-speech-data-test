 We are not similar in ideas, nor in social references, nor in our conceptions of the state, nor in the ethos and style of power, and certainly not in the interests we represent.  And make it clear once again in all directions: Under no circumstances are we going to enter this arena of toxicity and division that Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy is seeking.  No slander and no provocation will distract us from our commitment to the big issues, to life, to security, to the reality that the vast majority of society is experiencing today.
