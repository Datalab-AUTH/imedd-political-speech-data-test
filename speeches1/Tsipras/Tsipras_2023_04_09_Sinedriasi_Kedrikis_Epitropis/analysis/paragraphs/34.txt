 An opportunity we deserve, not of course to return to power for power's sake.  Or much more to get some payback from our political opponents.  I said in an interview that we don't feel that history owes us, we owe history.  What we owe to history and what is the opportunity.  We owe it to history to govern this country under normal conditions.  Not with a knife to the throat.
