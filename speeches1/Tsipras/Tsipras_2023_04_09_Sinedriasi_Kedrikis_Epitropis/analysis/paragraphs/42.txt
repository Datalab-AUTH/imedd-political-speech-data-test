 And what they seek is the party's vote, the SYRIZA ballot paper to go to the ballot box, they seek more than the cross in their own name.  So let's talk, comrades, with the people, but also listen to the people.  To overcome the fences of the mainstream media and bring to the people, to all social groups, to all neighbourhoods, to all homes, the views and arguments of the party concerning their lives.  To try with the voice of reason, with calm and composure, to try to bring together all those streams of opposition, of anger, of indignation.  To unite them by convincing them that SYRIZA today is the only way out.  Because only if we bring them together will we be able to build this river, the river of change.
