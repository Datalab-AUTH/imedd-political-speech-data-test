 So, with these thoughts, I would like to conclude my presentation by saying that we now have the full knowledge of the problems facing Greek society, we have the plan, the programme, the solutions that are needed for the problems we face.  We have the vision, we know the changes and reforms needed to bring back a sense of justice, security and prosperity to the country.  We have the people who will bring about change.  We have the experience, the ideas, the strength from the roots of the Left and its struggles and the struggles of the democratic party, we have the experience to win this electoral battle.  But above all, we have the truth, the right, the determination, the programme, the people to win this battle.  And we will win this battle.  We will bring back justice everywhere in this land.
