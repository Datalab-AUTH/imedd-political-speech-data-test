 It is our duty in the elections of May 21 - but we must take care of it now - that no polling station on any outlying island, in any remote village, not only in the cities, is left without an electoral representative of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance.  And you know, this is not only a guarantee for the safeguarding of the process, it is also a message.  Our presence at every polling station is a message of victory on election day.  Our second task is, in the run-up to the elections, to demand not only the vote but also something necessary to get out the vote, to organise our campaign: To claim the financial support of our members, our friends, the people, to achieve victory and change.  Because SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, comrades, is the only party that does not owe anyone.  And it is not fed by vested interests.  It relies solely on the contribution of its members and supporters.  Our campaign should therefore be funded by our friends and supporters, not by hidden sponsors.  We have no hidden sponsors.
