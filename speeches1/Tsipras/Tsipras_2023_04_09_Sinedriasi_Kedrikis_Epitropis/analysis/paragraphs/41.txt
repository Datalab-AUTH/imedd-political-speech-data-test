 But this, this knowledge, confronts all of us here, all of us, all the members of the Central Committee, with difficult tasks.  The task of putting the whole party, down to the last village, down to the last outlying island, in position and in battle formation.  The task of organizing this battle and leaving nothing to chance.  The duty to get out of the offices and the closeness of manifestos, to recall a good song, and get out into society, where society lives and breathes, where citizens breathe, where we all find ourselves where the fruit of change and progressive government is bound.  The task, too, is to show through the electoral battle that our candidates have a difference from others: They are competing on rules for their votes, but they are not competitors, but competitors.
