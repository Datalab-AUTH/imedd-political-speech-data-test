 So the reality has to do with this generalized feeling of insecurity and injustice that prevails throughout Greek society, in every aspect of it.  So this harsh reality and these big problems that Greek society has today are looking for solutions.  And these are the problems we have to deal with in this run-up to the elections.  For these problems we need to highlight the solutions that we have been working on all along.  We will tackle these problems with a plan, determination and a will for major reform, reform and change.  And believe me, citizens are hungry to hear solutions to their problems, not statements.  We all know who Mitsotakis and his government are.  Citizens want to hear solutions.  No statements or easy excuses.
