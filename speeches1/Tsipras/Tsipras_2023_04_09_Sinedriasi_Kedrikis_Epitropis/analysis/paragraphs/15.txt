 I believe that the tragic accident of Tempe - and today we are 40 days away from this tragic accident and we must say here today that we are not forgetting our fellow citizens, the young children who were unjustly lost, who took the train to go to their destination and never arrived - the tragedy of Tempe, well, I have the feeling that it has changed the way Greek society stands against the political system as a whole.  Easy propaganda is no longer easy to digest.  The whole governmental narrative of the regime has been thrown into the dustbin at once.  The so-called executive state that turned out in practice to be a broken state, the so-called excellent people who turned out to be useless, the so-called modernists who turned out to be anachronistic, plunged us into the oldest times of partisanship, family rule, favouritism and anarchy.  And above all, I think that this tragic accident has shown how false this whole mechanism of powerful propaganda is.  How rigged and hypocritical is the chief of staff of the staff state, who supposedly knew nothing and is not responsible for anything.  Everybody else in this country is responsible, we all have one responsibility, 10 million responsibilities, except one: The Prime Minister.
