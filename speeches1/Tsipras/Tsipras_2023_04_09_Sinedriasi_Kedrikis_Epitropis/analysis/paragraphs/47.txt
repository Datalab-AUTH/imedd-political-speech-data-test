 So, it is crucial and decisive that we decide here today to make the economic dash towards the elections and put it into practice.  Comrades, I would like to remind you, as I come to the end of my speech, that in addition to the battle of the national elections, we will soon be facing another electoral battle, the local government battle, in October.  And at the local government level, we are also preparing for this battle.  In many municipalities there are already processes for the emergence of suitable Combinations and the most suitable as leaders of these Combinations, mostly Progressive Cooperation Combinations.  We monitor these processes and encourage them.
