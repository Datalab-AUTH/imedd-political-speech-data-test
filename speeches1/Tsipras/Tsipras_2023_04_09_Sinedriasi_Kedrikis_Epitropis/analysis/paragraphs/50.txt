 In the Municipality of Piraeus, we have the pleasure to be able to decide today to support a proven fighter of the Left and of the Local Government, as he was the Deputy Governor of Piraeus and the islands for five years: our comrade, George Gavrilis.  And to wish good strength and success to the "Port of Agony".  In the Municipality of Patras, we can today have the pleasure to announce our support to the President of the Technical Chamber of the region, Vassilis Aivalis, in a broad electoral list of cooperation of progressive forces.  In the Municipality of Peristeri, we have the pleasure today to announce our support to one of the most successful local government leaders, the current Mayor-Patriarch of Local Government, Andreas Pachaturidis.  In Larissa, we have the pleasure and honour to support a comrade, who is equally successful, for many years mayor, the current mayor of Larissa, Apostolos Kalogiannis.  Finally, we can announce our support for the Municipality of Agrinio, to the reputable and experienced lawyer, Dimitris Trapeziotis.
