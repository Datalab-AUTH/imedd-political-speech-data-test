 Our goal is to promote winning ballots and broad progressive cooperation, taking into account, of course, in each case, the local characteristics and the particularities of each municipality.  But today, given that we will probably not meet again until the elections, today we are in a position in this Central Committee to decide our support for a number of large municipalities.  As our statute provides, moreover, that for large municipalities the decision is a decision of this body.  In the Municipality of Athens, I believe that we are in a position to announce, and I am very happy about this, our support to an effort that has already begun to form a broader rallying front with a single goal: Change in the Municipality of Athens.  The "long walk" of suffering and family rule must end at some point.  He tired us all.
