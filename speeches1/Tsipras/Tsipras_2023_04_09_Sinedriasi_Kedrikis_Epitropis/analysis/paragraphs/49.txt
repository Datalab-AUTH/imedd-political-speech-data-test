 The desire of the well-known international basketball player of Panathinaikos, formerly of AEK Athens, Nikos Pappas, to lead such an effort is, I believe, a very positive development.  In the next period, we will therefore encourage and contribute to the realization of such a development with the maximum possible rallying of political and self-governing forces, so that we can achieve together, the trifecta of change for the Municipality of Athens.  And it will be a buzzer beater, as they say in basketball parlance.
