 So today we approve our ballot papers.  I want to tell you, just so you know, that it was a pleasure and a headache, the ballots.  A pleasant headache, because we had to make difficult choices between very important and strong candidates.  And we may have wronged some comrades, in the sense that it is very difficult to choose between equivalent candidates.
