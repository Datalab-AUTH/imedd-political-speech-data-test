 And I don't mean whether we can win the elections, which of course is the key to tomorrow, but whether we can create such correlations and such conditions so that we win not just one election, but that justice, transparency and meritocracy gain ground every day.  To put into practice step by step what we call an effective and just state.  Our response here, I believe, should not simply be, yes we can, but should be something more: today we are the only ones who can lead such an effort for change, not only on election day, but change that will be profound and touch the everyday lives of citizens.  Why.
