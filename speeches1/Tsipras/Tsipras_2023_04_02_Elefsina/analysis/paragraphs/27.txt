 We have the right to have for the first time in the country's history a government of cooperation of all progressive forces.  All the.  Labour.  They can be much more stable if they are governments on a programmatic basis of like parties, much more stable than governments of arrogance and self-reliance.  They bankrupted us.  But there is a precondition for us to have on May 22nd such a long-lasting government, stable on a progressive programmatic basis.  The precondition is the victory of SYRIZA in the elections of 20.  Polished and treacherous government I will say it in a catchphrase house 4 things means wage increase, price reduction, debt regulation and a fair safe and efficient state next to the citizen these 4 things I would like to call on you all to give this battle.  Victory is huge.  The Greek women and Greeks deserve this victory, we deserve a better Greece and we will achieve it well.
