I am very happy that it is a rainy day here today, but your presence signals that the twenty-first of May is not a sunny day for our country.  Honey all day long for our country after 4 years of patience comes the time to say enough is enough, with injustice enough, with obscenity as much as pet degradation of rights as much as here, with a booty state that they have transformed as much as here with the degradation of our lives.  I'm in a region that has been experiencing injustice for years.  West Attica is the backyard of Attica.  And especially Elefsina, an area with very important productive potential, has suffered for years the injustice, but also the.  The environmental degradation and I know that we were here in 2017 to set the terms of a development plan for your region and your sales with the regional conference.  Unfortunately, from 2019 until today, nothing has been implemented from what was planned and I am here today, apart from what I will tell you about the central political scene, to say that for us justice means that there are no second-class cities or regions.  For us justice.
