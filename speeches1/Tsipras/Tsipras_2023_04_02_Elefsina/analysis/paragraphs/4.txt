 Our pensioners were told that we would keep the thirteenth pension that we had established in 19 that for 800. 000 pensioners were whole and they said crumbs were committed.  They will keep it as soon as they were elected, they abolished it, I didn't keep it for 4 years, 4 billion euros were taken away from pensioners if you include the retroactive payments that I promised to give and they didn't give 7 billion euros, they took away from pensioners.  This was the great deception.  To the middle class and pensioners.  And what was the plan of the Mitsotakis government.  The plan was a great redistribution of wealth from the many to the few from the middle class, to the powerful and how is this great redistribution of wealth achieved through the maintenance of high indirect taxation, mainly VAT and excise tax, when inflation has gone up to 10 to 15%?  So what do we do?  I'll tell you In simple words.
