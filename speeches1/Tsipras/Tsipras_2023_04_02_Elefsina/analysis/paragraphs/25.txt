 There's a value to this battle, you know, it's going to be a crucial battle.  It will be given home to the home man, the man, because our opponents' strategy has been 4 years of media supremacy to create the image that everything is going well.  We were sinking everything, it was going well, we had Moses the Greek, the problems now gone and Moses gone and Cheetahs.  If there the campaign in those of self-gratification not going well, I know I'm going well, it's catching their strategy now.  Not that everything is going well, that everyone is the same, it's that they can't change things.  So this is the reality.  No, and we're not all.  The same is seen by our look for words.
