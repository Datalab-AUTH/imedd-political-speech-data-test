The traditions of the labour movement are very important here in the region and I want to address especially today to the workers but also to what is called the middle class and pensioners I see many here so I want to say that the biggest deception that was done by the government of the New Democracy was the deception of the middle class and pensioners.  And the greatest degradation was that done to the worker with the jungle labor laws that effectively abolished labor laws.  They introduced the eight-hour period, introduced unpaid overtime, dismantled the labour inspection body.
