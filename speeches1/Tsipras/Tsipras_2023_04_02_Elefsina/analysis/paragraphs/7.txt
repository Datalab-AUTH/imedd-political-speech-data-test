 The phrase.  It's better to be governed by a left that does what it can than a right that does what it wants and I think.  I think this phrase all of the things in our country.  We governed in the most difficult conditions the country has known since the post-independence period and then a bankrupt country.  And we did everything we could to get the country out of the mire, to get it out of debt, to give it a perspective.  We could and they did.  We took the country out of the memoranda, we left 37 billion in the public coffers, we regulated the public debt and then came a right-wing that wanted to do what it wanted in complete impunity, in complete impunity, in arrogance.  Having a sense of uncontrollability that no one is controlling them and no one will control them and what they did, they violated everything.  Every democratic rule, even the rules of the Constitution that half of the political system watched from inside the Maximou mansion, Ministers, Chiefs of Armed Forces, party leaders, MPs, MEPs, they believed and believe, they continue to believe that this state belongs to them, that it is a hereditary right, that Greece and even the reign of family rule everywhere made the state a spoil.
