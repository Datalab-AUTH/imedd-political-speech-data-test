 That SYRIZA is now coming to put taxes on the citizens, we put taxes on the citizens, we found a country bankrupt and they ruled with the Troika, we took it out of the hole, we left a debt of 356 million billion euros.  Do you know how much reached today 400 billion euros.  We left the private debt 47 billion euros lower than it is today, increased the public debt by 44 billion euros and 40 billion euros.  The private debt.  Big question, where did that money go.
