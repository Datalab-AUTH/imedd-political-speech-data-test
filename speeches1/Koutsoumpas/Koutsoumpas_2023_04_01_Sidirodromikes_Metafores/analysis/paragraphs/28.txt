 The social character of rail transport is not possible if the construction of the works, the production of lines and rolling stock, the energy industry, and the construction of the works are not social in nature.  The social character of rail transport is not possible if its "competitors", air, sea and road transport, do not have a social character. 	That is why the KKE is not fighting the battle against the policy of liberalisation and commercialisation, under the banner of yesterday, of the return to the state monopoly of the dictatorship of capital, but under the banner of their socialisation, with the working class, the people at the helm of power. Universal, safe, safe, quality and cheap transport and public transport for the people can only be guaranteed by the new social system, socialism.  On the ground of social property, transport ceases to be a commodity and is enshrined as a social right.
