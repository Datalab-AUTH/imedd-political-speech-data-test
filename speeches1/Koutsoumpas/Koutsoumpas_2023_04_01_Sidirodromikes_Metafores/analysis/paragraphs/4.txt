As if they have not read the reports of the European Union, where only in 2021, in one year, 1. 339 major rail accidents with 683 fatalities, 97 of which involved train collisions... They continue to bombard us with all manner of cover-ups of the truth:  That a 'bad privatisation' with unreliable investors has taken place, that 'proper implementation of EU policy' will save us, or some general and abstract 're-nationalisation'.  Talk about the cigarette case for the root of the problem.
