 This is why the single scientific central planning of production and the economy in general can be implemented in this way.  Only in this framework, the unified state transport body will be able to plan, develop and implement an integrated system of combined transport, based on the expanded satisfaction of all working people's needs. 	First and foremost, the possibility of a unified nationwide planning of the economy, based on the needs of the working people, will be directly reflected in the planning and priorities of the transport networks.  This is the only way to put an effective end to the current reality of the development and exploitation of transport networks according to the needs of one or the other part of capital at the expense of society. 	The social ownership of land and the criterion of balanced development can allow the location of all the necessary technical infrastructure works: from the appropriate lines, maintenance facilities and stations, according to scientific criteria and not on the basis of contradictions or the increase in profit of one or the other.  	The central planning of the economy, on the basis of social ownership of the concentrated means of production, will give priority to mass fixed-track transport for the continental part of the country. 	Transport planning will be based on the interconnected and complementary action of all modes of transport.  Aiming at fast and cheap movement of people and goods, energy saving and environmental protection, planned development to eliminate regional asymmetry, full control of the defence and security of a truly workers-people's state.   	The elimination of competition between groups will allow the best way and the best transport mix to be calculated each time.
