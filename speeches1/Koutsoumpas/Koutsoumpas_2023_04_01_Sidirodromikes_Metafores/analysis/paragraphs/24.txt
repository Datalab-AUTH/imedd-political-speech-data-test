 SYRIZA continues to talk about the safety nets that existed until 2019 and were abolished by the Mitsotakis government and promotes as a salutary solution "the use of the Recovery Fund to rebuild a public transport network and renegotiate contracts".  The president of PASOK speaks openly about a return to the public sector, consolidation, and then privatisation with new conditions.  Varoufakis explained in his earlier interviews that he was in favour of private entry into OSE, because the Greek state did not have the capacity for investment... And in more recent ones, that he disagreed with the choice of the Italian company because it could not invest either... He needed, in other words, a different kind of successful privatisation.  None of them question the basic framework of EU commercialisation and liberalisation.  The tragedy of 2023 is therefore the essential result of the EU - Greek bourgeoisie policy on rail transport - freight, which all bourgeois governments have been implementing, with miraculous precision, throughout the previous period.  That is why the views on the supposed Greek specificity, or on the neoliberal dissonance of Greek railways against the "European reality" that is friendly to trains, simply lack seriousness.
