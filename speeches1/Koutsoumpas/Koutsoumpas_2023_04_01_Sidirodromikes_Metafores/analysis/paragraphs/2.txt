 Friends and friends, For a month now, the government and the parties of the system have continued their provocative attempt to cover up the real culprits and the causes of the crime.  The government and SYRIZA, continue to provoke, with the miserable ping-pong about the responsibility rates of the current and the previous government.  Ministers continue to promote the outrageous narrative that everything is the stationmaster's fault.  SYRIZA and PASOK executives claim that the deep examination of the issue leads to a diffusion of responsibility and that the only responsible party is the Mitsotakis government.  They call on us to exonerate the rest of the guilty so that their obvious, timeless responsibilities, which life itself dramatically highlights, do not spread.
