 (an existing subsidiary of OSE) and the remaining activities of OSE in the provision of railway services.  Initially, TRAINOSE remains a subsidiary of the OSE Group.  Finally, in 2008, TRAINOSE becomes independent from OSE.  Finally, the independence of TRAINOSE is completed with the latest legislation of the PASOK government, which annuls the last remaining link between the two companies, giving the rolling stock of OSE to the ownership of TRAINOSE and replacing the hitherto existing system of renting the rolling stock from TRAINOSE. 	The next act of the drama was the 2010 PASOK law on railways, which was the last link in a long chain of reforms that as a whole constitute the liberalisation of rail transport.  This law implements the completion of the separation of OSE and TRAINOSE, the separation of infrastructure and operation, and provides for an extensive operational restructuring of the railway undertakings.  The government of SYRIZA, then, was the one that proceeded with the sale of TRAINOSE to Italian Railways, while then, during the government of the Southwest, the process of absorption of the rolling stock maintenance company from TRAINOSE was completed.
