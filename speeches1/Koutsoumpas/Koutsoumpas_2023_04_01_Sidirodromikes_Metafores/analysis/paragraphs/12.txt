 	The next essential step in promoting liberalisation was a set of European directives that built on and extended Directive 440/91.  These are Directives 12/2001, 13/2001 and 14/2001 which were condensed and became known as the EU's first railway package.  This is followed by a second set of directives, Directives 49/2004, 50/2004 and 51/2004, known as the European Commission's second railway package, which introduces full liberalisation of all rail freight transport in the EU from the beginning of 2007.  It is thus a milestone in the history of rail liberalisation in the EU, at least for freight transport.  Next step, the third railway package of 2007.
