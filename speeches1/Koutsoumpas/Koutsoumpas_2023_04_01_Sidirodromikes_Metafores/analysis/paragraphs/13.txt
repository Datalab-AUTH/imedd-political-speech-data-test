 It introduces the liberalisation of international passenger transport from 2010.  The culmination of all this, most recently came the 2012 directive on the "creation of a single European railway area", which essentially unifies the previous directives. 	In our country, the long-standing policy for the liberalisation of railways in Greece follows the corresponding policy of the EU, the main aim of which is to create a single market for railway activities, in which the monopolistic groups of the EU can invest without any hindrance.   	However, the creation of a single rail market required the separation of transport operations from the rail infrastructure.  This is the key element of the European liberalisation policy: the separation of rail infrastructure from transport work.  This is the only way to ensure that the infrastructure can be used by other companies, the only way to pave the way for the penetration of groups into rail transport.  The consequences of this policy are, as is constantly being demonstrated, tragic for the working people. Liberalisation has two main, complementary axes, separation and full commercialisation.  Segregation means that many different firms compete and operate on the same network.  The "mess" of understanding between OSE, and Hellenic Train did not succeed.  It worked.
