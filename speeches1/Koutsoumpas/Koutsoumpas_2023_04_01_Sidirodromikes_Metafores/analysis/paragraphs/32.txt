The necessary construction projects, large and small scale, to be implemented and planned in cooperation with the single state construction agency.  This is our proposal.  Thus achieving maximum economy of human and other resources, minimising costs and impact on the natural environment, sharing infrastructure.  In absolute contrast to the current, literally murderous reality, where the competition between groups for the implementation of projects even leads to the halting of projects that could play a catalytic role in security.  The development of the railways, from rails to wagons, engines and control and telecommand systems, will rely on the productive capacities of manufacturing, especially heavy industry.  And at the same time, they will contribute to the development of new technical solutions and new production capabilities.  The dialectical development of the transport industry and the transport and metal production industry, within the framework of the scientific central plan and labour control, leads at the same time to a minimisation of social costs and at the same time to an increase in the productive potential of the respective industry.  The metal industry, will produce rails and metals for rolling stock.  The transport industry will produce wagons.  The electronics industry will produce remote management systems.
