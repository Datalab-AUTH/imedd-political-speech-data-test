	We call on all of you to join with the KKE to organize the great popular counter-offensive against the real opponent of the Greek people and youth, the ruling class, its state, the governments and the parties that serve it.  To convict all political accomplices for the crime of Tempi, all accomplices for the theft of our income, the levelling of our rights, the constant crimes concerning our health and safety.  To condemn those who ruled and are ruling the country and to strengthen the KKE, the only real popular opposition. 	To gain the life we deserve we must lose capital.  There is no other way out than the path of subversion.
