 And all this, with the aim of achieving maximum social savings.  The anarchy of the capitalist market, the different interests of each section of capital, is unable both to design and to work out such a solution, which is the only one that can come much closer to the socially optimal. 		Transport can only function as a whole with this character, only with the parallel domination of social property, central planning and workers' control over the whole of the centralised means of production. A prerequisite for the realisation of transport development objectives is the planning of the relevant infrastructure - ports, airports, railway stations, roads - and the transport industry.  The same applies to telecommunications, the processing of raw materials, the industrial manufacturing sectors, particularly in the production of machinery. 	The scientific central planning and the criterion of satisfying the needs of the people translates into absolute priority in safety measures, for the staff and for the passengers transported.  The system in which the KKE will be present in power, in governance, does not value human lives in euros.  Labour governance implements all the necessary measures, intrinsic safety measures, staff training measures, technical measures and solutions to ensure the minimisation of accidents, based on the capabilities of our time.   	Several people wonder if all this can be done.
