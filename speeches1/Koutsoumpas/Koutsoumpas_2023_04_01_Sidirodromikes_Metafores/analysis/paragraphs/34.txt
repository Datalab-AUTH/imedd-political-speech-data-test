 The study of the historical experience of the first attempt at socialist construction in the previous century, with great limitations, of course, compared to the present level of development of the relevant technology and infrastructure, helps us to answer.  For example, the achievements concerning the restoration of the damaged railway lines from the First World War and the civil war, the conversion of the main lines to electrification, the development of new types of traction engines and communication systems, the rapid development of the network before the second five-year plan of central planning in the then Soviet Union was completed, are not even questioned by serious bourgeois analysts.  	The serious effort to upgrade transport safety also.  This obviously does not mean that there were no accidents, breakdowns, handling errors and material failures in the Soviet Union or in other countries.  Particularly in the first years of socialist construction and in the last decades of their existence, under the negative influence of the prevalence of "socialism with market" and other mistakes and weaknesses, which finally opened the way to the victory of the counter-revolution, marking a major setback.  However, its superiority over capitalism is reflected in the frequency and severity of accidents, in relation to the length and number of railway lines and the volume of transport work.   		There is the counterargument of possible "withholding of evidence".
