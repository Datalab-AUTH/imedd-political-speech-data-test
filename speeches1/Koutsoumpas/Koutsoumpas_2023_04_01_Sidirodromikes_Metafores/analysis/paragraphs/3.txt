 Even though the repeated complaints warning of the risk of a major accident in rail transport have come to light.  The repeated complaints of the KKE in the Parliament, the announcements of PAME trade unionists, the out-of-court notices of unions are well known and we do not need to repeat them.  	What if the tragic deficiencies in personnel, infrastructure, the necessary training, the organization and the effective implementation of regulations, the necessary coordination of those responsible, the operation of a telecommand and light signaling system... The parties and the parrots of the system, continue the serial of mockery and distortion of the truth.  	And what have we not heard all these days. 	That "these things only happen in backward Greece and not in Europe".  That "the situation was very good until the current government took over" and vice versa, that "the only positive steps were taken by the government of the Southwest".
