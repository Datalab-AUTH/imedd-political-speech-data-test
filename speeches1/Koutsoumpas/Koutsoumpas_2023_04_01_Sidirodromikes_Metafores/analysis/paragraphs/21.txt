Friends The liberalisation of rail transport is literally a recipe for increased risk, for railway workers and passengers alike.  In a system of great complexity, high sensitivity and many risks, many different firms are active, each of which, aiming for the greatest possible profit, aims to pass on the costs to the others.  It aims to increase its profit margins as much as possible.  Here we have to take into account the competition from groups that have invested in major roads and an upgrade of rail transport can have a negative impact on their profitability.  All the parameters concerning the prevention and mitigation of the consequences of major accidents are put on the cost-benefit scale for each group and for the capital state.  Decisions are made on the basis of capitalist profitability: On the number of recruitments, the pace and hours of work, the level of wages and the effective training of workers.  Based on the commitments and guidelines of the EU, and the strategy of capital, the bourgeois state chooses which investments to prioritise and how much money to allocate.
