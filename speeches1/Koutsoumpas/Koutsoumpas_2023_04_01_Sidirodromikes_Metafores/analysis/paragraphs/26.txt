 No one should be trapped again by the offer of phony salvation solutions, by a supposedly "more progressive government" the next day.  We will not be saved by a better privatisation, a supposedly stricter public control, nor by a "re-nationalisation without compensation".  As long as transport is a commodity and the railway companies operate within the capitalist economy, the situation cannot change radically, essentially.  	Even if the transport enterprises are owned by the capitalist state, they will operate for profit and in the strategic interests of the ruling class.  They will squeeze their workers, they will waste passengers, they will take security measures only on the basis of cost-benefit ratio for the company and the state.  Their very monopolistic nature says that if they don't do this, they will become loss-making, they will be damaging to working taxpayers and they will not be able to implement necessary projects. Even if we were to return to the era of the state monopoly, it would borrow, purchase equipment and contract out projects to groups, according to the laws of the capitalist market.
