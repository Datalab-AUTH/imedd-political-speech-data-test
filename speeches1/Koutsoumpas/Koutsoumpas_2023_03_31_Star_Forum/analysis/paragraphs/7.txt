 In fact, this stability, this help to the system given by the various parties, has even been the envy of some French magazines lately.  If you saw, which even wrote where we will find a Tsipras to raise the retirement age to 67 without opening his nostrils.

In the debate from this podium, although I think that contrary to what the New Democracy is saying, he knows very well what he wrote and this magazine and that's why he's proud that the magazine, when it called him a good reformer.  Skinner on the pensioners' stuff, although he was obviously mocking him for it, this is some praise.
