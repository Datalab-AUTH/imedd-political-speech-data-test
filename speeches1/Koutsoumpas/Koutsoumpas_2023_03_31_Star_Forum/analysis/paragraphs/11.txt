Another such investment is the announcement of the construction of student halls of residence at the university through PPPs.  So the people have to pay for the construction of the dormitories, but also pay rent for their children's dormitories, while there is a need for truly free education for all students.  Such an investment is the redevelopment of the Panhellenic Exhibition of Lamia of the area that hosts us today, in which we are located, which could certainly be exploited for the benefit of the people of the Greek people with modern facilities, recreational areas, but in the end it is only given to business groups.  Such an investment is the millions that will be given for the various roads.  The modern roads, so advertised.

For the builders, for the contractors and then he pays them in gold again to use them with the tolls, while the surrounding villages here in the plain of Spercheios drown with the first rain.  We know what he's pulling.
