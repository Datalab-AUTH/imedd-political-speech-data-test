 The differences in the proposals of the other parties are of which pocket the people will pay again.  The KKE does not just have differences, but it stands, and we say this to you frankly with our hand on our heart and looking you in the eye, it stands against the interests, the great interests of large economic business centres, of the governments they support and of their parties, the Communist, Greece has no commitments either to the domestic or to the international elites.  We believe that the KKE is a real guarantee for the development of mass decisive struggles, for the defence of our people outside and inside the Parliament, so that the various big groups, those who have the money, those who squeeze the people, and not the people again, pay the bills.  Why the vote for the KKE Remain in the KKE will not turn into support either.  Nor will it tolerate any unpopular government, whatever its composition, whatever the parties that make it up, because in this way the KKE assumes its responsibility towards the people, because progress means fighting for the right of the many, it means confrontation with this corrupt system and not a passport to government chairs after the elections, in the context of which the truly progressive today is in the claim.  The contemporary needs of the new generation of workers, the self-employed, farmers, women, scientists, artists.
