 On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of STAR Central Greece.  I would like to convey to all of you to all the employees of the station.  To the whole region here the warm wishes of the Communist Party of Greece for a good continuation with health and strength in all your efforts for the KKE, information is a basic people's right and in this regional television can play a special role, both to identify and highlight the important problems faced by the people's families in the region, as well as the promotion of the struggles of the workers' demands in many and important workplaces in sectors of the region of the workers of various sectors, and the promotion of the struggles of the workers of the region. For all these reasons, the KKE has always supported the just demands of journalists and other media workers, so that they can contribute without restrictions and exclusions to informing our people about all the issues that concern them in the region, but mainly in the whole of Greece, of course.  Your initiative to organise this very interesting conference coincided with the announcement of the date of the elections by the Prime Minister the day before yesterday.  A communication.
