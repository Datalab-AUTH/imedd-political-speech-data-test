 For example, the village, but other villages here in the plain of Lamia, but also further up, some time ago we were there and we saw the malpractices of the investors who have devastated the area.  Creating a lake in the villages, so that the water from the streams comes back in case of flooding in every downpour with huge damage to crops, livestock, houses, property, even endangering the lives of the inhabitants.  It is the criminal policy.  We believe in the cost-benefit that led us to the predictable crime of Tempe, which filled the Greek people and youth with sincere sadness and unimaginable anger.  And here in our region, leading to some of the biggest mobilizations ever in Lamia and elsewhere.  Throughout the country.
