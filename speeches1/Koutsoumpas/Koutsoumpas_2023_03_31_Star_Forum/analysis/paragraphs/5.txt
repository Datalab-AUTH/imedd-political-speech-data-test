 I would like to say that Mr Mitsotakis accompanied it with the well-known blackmailing dilemma of ungovernability or stability, saying that stability will be ensured by his own party.  The self-reliance of his own party.  Of course, our people have experienced this stability in the last four years with the criminal management of the pandemic and with the dangerous involvement of Greece in the war raging on the territory of Ukraine and with the energy crisis and with the accuracy that eats away at their income.  All these things, no matter how much the government of the New Democracy calls them imported in a somewhat convenient way, are the direct results of a policy in which the government of the New Democracy and all previous governments have had a hand and have implemented up to their eyeballs.  The same dilemma is also served in different versions.
