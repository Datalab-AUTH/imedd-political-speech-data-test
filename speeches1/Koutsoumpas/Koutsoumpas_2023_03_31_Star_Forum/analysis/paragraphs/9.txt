 Politically, of course, we mean today that this common up and down direction is expressed both in the unpopular preconditions of the Recovery Fund and in the European Union's directions for the liberalisation of energy, railways, water, we will say water, water finally with dangerous NATO war plans and adventurism with the attack on people's homes to support the bankers at a time when a new economic capitalist crisis is brewing internationally and much more about it.  And we all believe that they want to get the support or at least the tolerance of the people, in a policy that is ultimately the one that accumulates even more instability, insecurity for the working people themselves, for pensioners, for young people, for young people, for young women.  And this is also reflected in the specific issues that concern the people and youth of the region, which are of course linked and determined by the general policies that are followed.  After the visit of the Prime Minister and the election event that was set up with the help of the regional and local administration, it seems that the people of the region have nothing to expect from the billions that were advertised in this fiesta.  With the Prime Minister's announcements.
