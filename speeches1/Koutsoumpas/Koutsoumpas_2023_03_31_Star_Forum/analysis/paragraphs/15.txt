  The serious decrease in population in several areas of Central Greece and especially here in Fthiotida, is the result of the abandonment by the state, especially of these rural areas, an area which instead of producing quality cheap agricultural products, in order to solve the food problem of the population, is wiping out farmers and livestock farmers.  In order for a young person to stay here, to be active professionally, to start a family, to live in his place, it is necessary to have the necessary state assistance to cope with all these adversities.  We need public hospitals fully staffed, equipped and not in the current state of the hospitals of Lamia and Livadia.  The rest needs health centres, rural clinics, schools for its children, development of cultural and sports infrastructure, projects to protect its life and property from natural and other hazards.  The KKE was and is with the people of North Evia in the catastrophic fire of 2021 ignited by the state government policy.  We are fighting for 100% compensation against the false promises in the so-called reconstruction plan that is tailor-made for big interests.
