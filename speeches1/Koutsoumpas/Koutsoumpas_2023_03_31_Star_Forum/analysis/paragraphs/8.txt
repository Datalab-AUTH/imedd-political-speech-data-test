 Of course, we also hear the leader of PASOK, Mr. Androulakis, in the last few days, I don't know whether he will repeat it in the future and here in front of you, proposing his own solution for stability, which is a coalition government, either of the new Republic, PASOK or SYRIZA PASOK, simply with another person as prime minister, apart from Messrs. Mitsotakis and Tsipras.  This proposal is perhaps revealing because it proves that finally everyone in this place can go with everyone, since despite their individual differences, it unites an agreement on major issues in the strategic direction that will ultimately determine the next government's anti-people's policy, because unfortunately they all follow the same anti-people's path.  With other drivers, with other station masters, but on the same unpopular route, which is why they constantly derail trains or lead them into deadly collisions.
