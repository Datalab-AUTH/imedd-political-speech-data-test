 Indeed, the emotional charge is great.  As today in a few hours we bid farewell to a precious companion and friend Tasos Chronas who passed away the day before yesterday.  Who, as you all know, you know, we know for many decades from any position, either as a doctor in the hospital.  And director of the Radiology Clinic, either as a municipal councillor of the Municipality of Lamia, or as a regional councillor of the region of Sterea, or as a member of the KKE, a candidate for the party for many four years.
