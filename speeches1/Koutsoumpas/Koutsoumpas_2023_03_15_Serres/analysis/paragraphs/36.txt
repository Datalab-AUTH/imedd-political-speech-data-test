 All these years the governance of the new Republic has had a divine gift.  We would say, you had an opposition like SYRIZA that voted for half of its bills and a PASOK that voted for 70% of these bills of New Democracy.  So it had an opposition that you don't exactly call it an opposition, because you'd be doing it an injustice.  How can one characterize the we'll account after remembering where SYRIZA is in Pallini A letting the new democracy continue to dismantle the public health system and strengthen in 1000 two ways, the private sector.    How can one characterize the attitude towards anti-worker laws, when in the most emblematic law, that of Hadjidakis, SYRIZA voted for the half of the man, thus legitimizing all the anti-worker content of the law?   Also, how can one forget his attitude towards the new framework law on universities, which he may have voted against in Parliament, but his members, his organisations all over Greece, are still leading the way in its implementation, and nominating candidates to these notorious councils that are one of the key elements of the business operation of the university that this reactionary law passed, not to mention its attitude towards the struggles to put obstacles in the way of the New Democracy government's policy.  Did anyone see him anywhere, either here in Serres, but all over Greece, did anyone see PASOK, whose members in the trade union movement here, for example, in the Labour Centre, up to now.
