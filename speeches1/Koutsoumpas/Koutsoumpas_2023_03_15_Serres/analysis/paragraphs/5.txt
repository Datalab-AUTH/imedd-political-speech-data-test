 The only hope is the struggles to change something.  These days we have only had a small taste of what the united people and youth can do when they take the situation into their own hands, when they organise themselves, when they discuss collectively in the streets of struggle, when they decide their demands, their slogans, their forms of struggle, when they create their own organs of struggle.  Where there are no.  When they walk side by side with the communists who, as always, this time we are in the front line, feeling our responsibility in these critical hours.  It's already a great victory.
