 The deepest and broadest concept of freedom and democracy can take shape, all discrimination, all coercion and above all the exploitation of man by man will be abolished.  The only coercion will be the prohibition of exploitation in this power.  It will unleash the unprecedented potential that exists in production.  It exploits the great advantages of our country, the rich soils, the exceptional climatic conditions, the significant mineral wealth, the potential for real green energy from all domestic energy sources, the rich experience of the workers, the scientific achievements, the whole economy, every space, every infrastructure.  Every productive activity will converge through the central plan to a basic law, that is, the satisfaction of modern social needs and not the satisfaction of profit for a few.  Such governance will break the shackles of the country's international unequal relations and agreements.  It will liberate the country, it will free it from the delusion of the European Union and NATO.
