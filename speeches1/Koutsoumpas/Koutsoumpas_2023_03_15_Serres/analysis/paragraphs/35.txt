 The government of the New Democracy is indeed worse than the previous government of SYRIZA.  Like SYRIZA's, it was worse than the previous government of New Democracy and PASOK, from whom it took over.  And so it goes on and on, one worse than the other, because it is getting worse and worse for the working class, for our people, this rotten system.  All these will.  Gall for.
