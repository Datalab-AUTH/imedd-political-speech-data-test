 The hope of being made of the greatest materials of our history and our fighting surrender because each and every Mr. Y does not see each and every one of us simply as a vote at the ballot box, but as a fighter that together we will bring.  The world in the seed of our dreams in the seed of people for our children, for generations to come.  Gal turns.  Every crime, to dawn a world without wars, without barbarism, a world in which our modern needs will have been matched by their profits and will have won, so we will all together, all generations together, open the way to the great, the beautiful.  The shocking socialism, because it will.
