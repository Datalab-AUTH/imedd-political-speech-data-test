 It is no coincidence that the slogan chosen by the students, the workers here in Serres, in Serres, in Serres, in Serres, in Terres, the students, on the altar of profit, lives are lost because.  In both cases, in all cases, the hunt for profit, the logic of cost-benefit that cuts security measures, protection measures, maintenance of infrastructure by the state is what leads to tragedies for them, no matter how much the government of the New Democracy and the other parties that ruled want to muddy the waters somewhat, to throw the ball of responsibility to each other.  Or in a supposedly general systemic pathogenicity, disguising the real control, they will not succeed.  The culprit is the same person who has murdered dozens of delivery workers because they were working without protection measures and in highly intensive conditions.  The culprit is the same in both the picomex and the Farm and the Samina Express.  Both in Mati and Mandra.
