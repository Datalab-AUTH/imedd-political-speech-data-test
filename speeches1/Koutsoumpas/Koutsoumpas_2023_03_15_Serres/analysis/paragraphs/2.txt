 We welcome first of all the magnificent mobilisations of the workers of our people, especially the youth, who these days have flooded the streets and squares of cities all over Greece.  We call on them to do the same tomorrow in the big pan-worker nationwide strike to deaden the workplaces, to close schools and colleges, to make the strike meetings and the days and catch a big inflated to submit.  We said it and we do it.
