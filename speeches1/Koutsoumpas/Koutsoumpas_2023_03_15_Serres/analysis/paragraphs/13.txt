 The ball of responsibility.  And yet in Greece 2 0 to recall the name of the development plan of the New Democracy in Greece of the digital transition of green growth, where in a few.   I know with one click, the state can grab the house of the poor people with its electronic auctions.  These auctions voted by SYRIZA and continued by New Democracy, you see, in Greece there is a state, there are laws, there is class justice to make strikes illegal for security measures. On the railways, chasing trade unionists fighting for workers' rights, even arresting high school students for claiming to live a better life than the one they have prepared for them.  The same is true for other social strata, for farmers for example.  And here in Serres, because they dared to claim to stay on their land in their fields, but when it comes to the hundreds of workers who lose their lives, they put all the blame, at most, on some engine driver or some other worker who may have real responsibilities.  But in order for the big employers and the state as a whole.  Friends, compa√±eras and comrades.  So it's not the bad time, the bad time, the country, but those who ruled and are ruling this country, but us.  And in fact they ruled by implementing to the letter the policy, the directives of the European Union, which they are now trying to leave out of the frame, lying that this is not happening in Europe, in the European Union.  They are made and produced.
