 Easy or disillusioned those who thought that within a few days the anger would subside.  The mobilisations will fade away and the issue will be forgotten, since, as they say, for better or worse, life goes on.  Those who have tried to bring the mobilisations to their own measures have failed.  To give them the content that they would like these mobilisations to have.  Either to talk in general about the bad country, as if we are all to blame and the victims of this policy together, or to talk only about the responsibilities of a minister, a government. As if the problem only started in the last few years.  Those who have tried to set up provocations to terrorize with dismissals, with arrests even of young children, to suppress the mobilizations with state violence, have also failed.  Nothing you want to catch from them.
