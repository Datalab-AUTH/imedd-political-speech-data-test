 Thousands of demonstrators led by young people overflowing the streets in the squares, adopting radical slogans, demanding the necessary and the obvious.  That's why their needle is only stuck in one sorry.  Along with apologies, apologies and crocodile tears, they cry lest the people lose confidence in this barbaric system.  This is their pain.  Do not lose confidence in the parties that serve this system.  New Democracy and SYRIZA have brought out of the closet the boogeyman of political instability.  You've heard it.
