 Especially those who used to trust SYRIZA, who really had the expectation that a government of the so-called Left could really mean the end of the memoranda and their measures, that a government that talks the talk and slaps its hand on the table twice can change things radically.  We tell them that today they can think about all these issues better.  Because others have got today, like most of them, to think when, in good faith, many of them told us that if the button in such a supposedly progressive government, perhaps it would guarantee the course and the progressive choices, that the intentions of SYRIZA and its own leadership when it addressed us the call of 2012 or 2015, that perhaps they were telling us happened.  Think of them we say.
