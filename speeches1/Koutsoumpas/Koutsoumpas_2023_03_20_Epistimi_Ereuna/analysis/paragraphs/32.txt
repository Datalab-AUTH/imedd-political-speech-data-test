 We must end this rotten and unjust society as soon as possible.  	With the KKE we can do it.  Because the KKE has the only realistic plan, positions and proposals for today, which at the same time show where our struggle must go in order to give everyone a better life.  Because the KKE is the only party that has no commitment to the big business groups and therefore will not fold in the face of difficulties, in the face of repression.  	Dear friends, compa√±eras and comrades, The KKE is fighting with all its forces for the emergence of a power that will have nothing to do with the previous ones, a government that will not be one of the same, that will not have to manage exploitation and injustice.
