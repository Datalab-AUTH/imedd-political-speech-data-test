  It is the postdoctoral researchers who present themselves as external collaborators and cannot actually be appointed.  So, the term post-doc has now become a nice and neat way of saying unappointed and constantly wandering researcher.  	These are the highly skilled research workers who, in the name of mobility, of understaffing the funding with the project, go on a constant hunt for funding to cover the fixed costs of their research and their salary.  	It is the young researchers who are taking their first steps in the effort to develop knowledge, i.e., the PhD candidates who work on their theses dedicated to science, but most of the time under bad conditions, while, one would expect governments to ensure full support for their efforts, since they will be the skilled scientific workforce that will staff the university, research and the various sectors of the economy.  Instead, their categorisation as the third cycle of studies, combined with the abolition of permanent employment in universities and student welfare, gradually enabled the state to waive the obligation to cover the research and living expenses of doctoral candidates.  Of course, they should now feel lucky that they can chase, apart from underpaid and uninsured scholarships, industrial PhDs, giving companies rights and a say in the design of their scientific work, with all the risks that entails.   	And you, through your experience, can both confirm and enrich substantially and scientifically a more general truth: The developments of recent years in every field, but also in scientific research, confirm that the "medicine" used for one problem becomes "poison" for another, proving that no proposal of bourgeois management can cancel the laws and contradictions of the capitalist path of development, which in any case are paid for by the workers themselves.  The first study involving more than 7.
