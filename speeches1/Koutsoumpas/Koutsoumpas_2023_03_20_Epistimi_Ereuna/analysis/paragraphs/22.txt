	This is why the truly new and innovative in science and research can only be sought in that phrase of Brecht's about the purpose of science: the liberation of humanity from barbarism and toil.  	This is why the real innovative cannot be found in the definition of innovation given by the bourgeoisie think tanks and the various imperialist organisations, namely, that innovation is that which "accelerates the practical benefits of research for business".  	So that's why the real news is that the development of research should be planned without the institutions seeking resources from the market, by strengthening research teams in direct contact with the problems in sectors, production units and services.  		So that's why progress is not about reducing life expectancy, increasing infant mortality, dismantling public health services and at the same time locking up drugs and vaccines with patents.  	It is not progress to have successive refugee flows, entire peoples being bloodied, critical infrastructure of countries being destroyed by bombing and young researchers wasting their energies developing augmented reality applications for NATO's killing machine.  	See this example: In a NATO competition last year, contestants were asked to record, categorize and identify unmanned aerial systems, drones, as they flew in a defined area, based on data from available sensors.  Two laboratories - of the National Centre for Research and Technological Development - took 1st and 3rd place.  		Is this technology going to be used to defend our sovereign rights.  Let us consider what this means for science, the direction of research, the results it produces.  Who works hard for them and who wins.
