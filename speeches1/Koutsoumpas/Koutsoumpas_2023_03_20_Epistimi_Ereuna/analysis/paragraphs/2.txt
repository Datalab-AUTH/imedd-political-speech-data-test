	There is no need to analyse in this event the reasons why it is unthinkable in our time for trains to run in blindness, regardless of any existing human errors and negligence.  You understand this better than we do and can confirm and document it. 		And unfortunately we cannot be optimistic that we will not have more such crimes in the future, which today - and long before - are predicted.  One only has to look at the situation in the seismic armouring of schools and buildings, the condition of the ships that operate the coastal routes, the lack of flood protection works, even though we have paid for it so many times, the lack of preventive measures for the possibility of a large-scale industrial accident in industrial areas and so on. 	But we are optimistic that this situation can and will change and the only way for this to happen is for the promising struggle of the workers and especially the youth, pupils and students throughout the country to continue, to become even more massive, to acquire even more radical goals.  All those people who made grief and anger a mood to finally change something.  All those who went on strike, closed schools and colleges, defied terrorism, repression and those who say more or less that this is how the far right is strengthened - if that is possible.  - and took to the streets, shouting "it's their profits or our lives".
