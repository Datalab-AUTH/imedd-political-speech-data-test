 Competition and a toxic climate between colleagues, categorisation and discrimination based on "who brings money into the shop", privileged specialisations, the use of the "who brings money into the shop" principle, the use of the "who brings money into the shop" principle, the use of the "who brings money into the shop" principle, the use of the "who brings money into the shop" principle. χ.  those that are close to the market by definition... And poor relatives, such as the humanities, for which a role is also sought in the market context.  For the moment, it seems that digitisation in the name of an artificial interdisciplinarity is preferred.  	That is why, dear friends, compañeras and comrades, it is the call of the KKE that ensures unity, coherence based on the general characteristics of a significant number of academics and researchers. 	They are university teachers and researchers who are concerned about the present and the future of university education, who love their subject and do not accept that the market determines their interests and scientific questions, and who are called upon to answer with their research work.  Those who are evaluated by the capitalist system on the basis of the funding they bring to the university and research centres without caring about the quality of their work and the impact of their publications.  Those who teach in universities, called upon to fill the large gaps, when the ratio of faculty to students is 1/67, and as a solution to this, governments prefer the lanza to be made up of contract teachers and academic scholars in the name of gaining teaching experience, with the shocking scholarship - allowance of 2. EUR 000 for 6 months of employment.
