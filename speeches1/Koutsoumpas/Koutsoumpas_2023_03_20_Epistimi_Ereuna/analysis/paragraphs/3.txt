	We, for our part, commit ourselves to give our best as KKE and KNE to ensure that the crime is not forgotten, to impose measures to protect our lives and the lives of our children.  	There and only there will we deposit whatever strength the people and the youth give us in the political battles ahead of us in the coming period, while the parties of the bourgeois administration with shared roles will promote the next steps of this criminal policy. 	In these circumstances, we choose to discuss with you what is truly new and innovative in science and research, not to be distracted by very timely and ultimately human - very human - developments.  Instead, we seek to see together a great truth of our time.  A truth that says that the man of scientific intellectual work can, through the successive developments and the daily research and teaching toil, see himself and his anxieties in the political proposal of the KKE.
