	The second study emphasises the lag in research development, identifying that today there are less impactful discoveries, less innovative, using indicators of the impact of publications in the global research community and translating these into innovation for production. But who shapes the boundaries.  Because there is no longer the same intensity in radical discoveries that there once was. 	The study, while sound in terms of methodology and presentation of results, fails to provide comprehensive and convincing conclusions. 	Indicatively, he concludes that one possible explanation for the slowdown in innovation is that there are many more researchers today than in the middle of the last century.  It also stresses that the number of large collaborating research teams, often from several countries, has increased, which is conducive to producing piecemeal rather than radical results.  	But this should naturally give more momentum to the development of research, given that more people are collaborating in the production of new knowledge by more advanced means, in terms of greater socialisation of work.  	They even go so far as to blame the accumulation of knowledge for this, that all the great discoveries have been made and now there is little to be found.  	Another possible reason - they say - is that scientists today are obliged - as knowledge has advanced so much - to learn a much larger volume of things than in the past, leaving them little time to push the frontiers of their science.  The need for over-specialisation per scientific field has similar consequences. 	Friends, Allow us to raise some concerns in relation to the above-mentioned surveys.
