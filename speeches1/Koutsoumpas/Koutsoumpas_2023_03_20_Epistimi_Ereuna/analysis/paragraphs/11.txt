 This inherent failure of the system, the apologists of the capitalist mode of production have dubbed it the "skills gap".  With this novel term, they attempt to blame the (individual) choices of students and the operation of the universities.  They hide that in this system there will never be suitable jobs for everyone.  But they reveal something very important: That "businesses" are built by workers, not by "investors", that their capital is worthless without the right workers.
