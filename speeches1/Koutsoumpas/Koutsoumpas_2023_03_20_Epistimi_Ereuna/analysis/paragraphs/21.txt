 Does this stemming of the dynamic of scientific research lie in the capitalist conditions of organisation, in conditions where labour is more socialised?  	How many times have we heard, in the race for funding, research groups hiding their results while others are forced to stop promising studies to meet needs because they were not responding to the market and their development became financially unviable?  	But there is another aspect that concerns the overall intellectual constitution of the scientific potential.  	Is the need to fit more things into the scientist's mind - as the study identifies - the result of a policy that puts emphasis on developing scientists with specific skills, downgrading the global understanding of the laws governing each scientific subject?  	How can imagination, and therefore science fiction, be developed if there is no corresponding preparation from school onwards?
