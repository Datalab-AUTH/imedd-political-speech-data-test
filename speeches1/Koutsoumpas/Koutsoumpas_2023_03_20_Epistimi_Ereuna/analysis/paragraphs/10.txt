 From the very first moment we pointed out that this development is directly related to the commercialisation of education and research, so that universities and research institutions produce commercial value in direct connection with businesses.  It is also related to the decoupling of degree-profession, in order to serve the 4 Maastricht principles and to "free" future graduates from the shackles of access to a profession with stable employment relationships, in the name of flexibility, lifelong learning and wanderlust.  Finally, it is related to the increasingly pressing need for increased qualifications, which is the result of scientific development, the development of productive forces and the development of the economy.  	A need, however, that the anarchic way of development of the capitalist economy cannot meet, leading young graduates, the most dynamic part of the scientific potential, to unemployment, underemployment, emigration. 	The recent report by the National Authority for Higher Education (NEAE) was revealing: official unemployment among young graduates is 17%, higher than for the general population, and the highest in the EU.
