	Friends, the peoples have not said their last word.  The working class both in our country and internationally shows that it has metal.  The totality of developments shows that possibilities are being formed so that popular discontent is not trapped in false and blackmailing dilemmas.  It shows that the ruling class is not omnipotent and its power can be tested by cracks and shocks.  	Without disregarding the negative correlation of forces, the mass workers' - people's mobilisations in a number of countries, despite their still weak orientation, confirm that the people are not "given", nor will popular movements always be used as a "stepping stone" for the up and down of more or less the same kind of governments.  The bourgeois staffs in the EU and in Greece know that the disastrous consequences for the people of the implementation of capital's strategy will be seen much more strongly in the coming period.  That is why they seek as stable as possible governments "for the next day", governments that will seek to deal effectively with any radical mood that can lead to a revival of the labour movement.  They are worried about social explosions, the possible rise of radicalism, the dynamics that the struggles of the workers can gain by having a stronger KKE on their side.  The goal of this "governmental stability", which for the people means great instability and insecurity, is served by both the New Democracy and the other parties, SYRIZA, PASOK, but also MERA 25, regardless of the way each of them pursues it.  	Besides, the recent tragedies and the latest "Polakiada" highlight the scenarios of at least a national bourgeois understanding that are written more and more often by the two main pillars of the bourgeois political system with the various statements of prominent members of the Southwest, Syriza and PASOK about the possibility of a governmental cooperation.
