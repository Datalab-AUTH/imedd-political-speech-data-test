600 postdoctoral researchers from all over the world, attempted to answer why, while there is a lot of skilled potential and more PhD holders than before, there is a difficulty in attracting such potential from universities and research centres around the world.  The study concludes that working conditions and the lack of incentives to progress are to blame.  Singles out the extensive anxiety and uncertainty about their career path.   Half of respondents said their satisfaction with their job had deteriorated in the past year and 56% had a negative view of their career prospects.  Less than half would recommend a scientific career to their younger selves.  A quarter (24%) of respondents said they had been discriminated against or harassed during their current postdoctoral term.
