	 SPEECH BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE KKEKE PARTY DEMETRIS KOUTSOUMPAS AT THE EVENT ON: "WITH THE KKE FOR THE REALLY NEW AND INNOVATIVE IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH "Friends, comrades, compa√±eras and comrades We finally meet today for this event that we had planned before the crime in Tempe, an event that we had to postpone. 	When we talk about a predetermined crime, it does not mean that one knows exactly when and where it will happen.  But we know with certainty that it will happen, as long as human life and safety is weighed in the balance of cost-benefit for each investor and for the investor state.  This is the situation that the current government of the Southwest and all previous governments of SYRIZA and PASOK have created in the railways. 		As long as modern security devices, developed through the painstaking work of you and your colleagues, are treated across the country and around the world by investors as an extra expense that does not usually bring immediate financial benefits.
