 Marxism is a science, not a dogma, and that is why it "breathes" when it tries to respond to new challenges.  	So with the KKE.  To give new life, continuity and endurance to the struggles and youthful quests.  To inspire today's and tomorrow's scientists to put their knowledge at the service of societal needs.   For that day to come when every man will think scientifically and every science will think humanly.  	A strong JKE then.  "To make the darkness shine".  For the great, the beautiful, the shocking.
