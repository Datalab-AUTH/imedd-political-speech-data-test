 The issue of housing for the Roma, as for the entire Greek people.  It cannot be solved today by parties like SYRIZA that made electronic auctions of first homes and turned the mobilizations to prevent them into a personal offense that gave red loans to funds to the crows that opened the auctions for debts over 500 €.  It cannot be solved by parties like the New Democracy, which has retained and exploited all the legislative initiatives before SYRIZA and even extended them by opening up auctions for debts of €1 and above.  It cannot be solved by piecemeal measures that are reminiscent of rave logic, he explained, with the most typical example being the Roma loans that were given about 20 years ago to Roma families, but because they were unable to repay them, they are now threatened with auctions and their return to the camps again.  The KKE stands as a whole on the side of the thousands of working people who, because of this anti-people's policy, are on the blacklists of auctions; it stands against all Greek governments, the bourgeois state, the banks and the construction companies, the residents themselves and the.  Commodity they exploit.  The housing needs of our people as an object only of profitability, leading to the threat of auctioning even the first house.
