 For example, the state that considers the cost of critical infrastructure as goods for the life of the people, such as the railways with the tragedy of the Tempi River that we recently experienced, such as water, such as public health and so much more.  It is the state itself that considers all the necessary and substantial measures that can contribute to the solution of the complex issue of the social integration of the Roma to be costly.  A state hostile to what is necessary to decisively improve the lives of the majority of our people is at the same time becoming too.  You see friendly and effective.  Only to serve to serve the profits of a few big business groups.  Friends and friends.
