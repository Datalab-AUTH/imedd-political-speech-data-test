 On the occasion of the International Roma Day which is tomorrow 8 April, our thoughts are with the thousands of Roma who live under miserable conditions in the dozens of camps where they live without electricity, without drinking water, without any infrastructure, without any state care for the protection of the health of all these people.  Our mind and thought.  It is found simultaneously in the thousands of bio-framers.
