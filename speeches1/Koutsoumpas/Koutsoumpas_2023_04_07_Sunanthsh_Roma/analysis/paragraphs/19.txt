 On the occasion of the case with the Nazi Kasidiaris party, the government and various other parrots are shedding their crocodile tears you see on the channels when it is they themselves who tolerate and pave the ground with their policies to racism, to Nazism, to fascism, when it is the governments of New Democracy and Syriza who are responsible for the delay.  In the Golden Dawn trial, for example, which if it had been completed, there would have been no question of the participation of such Nazi criminals in the elections.  And now they are trying to prevent it with dangerous provisions, even giving them the title of anti-systemic, when it turns out that such pieces are flesh of the flesh of the system.  It is the people themselves who, through their struggle, must send such pieces to the dustbin of history along with their rotten reactionary and deeply systemic ideology.  We are the party that speaks openly and clearly to all the Greek people.  We do not want and do not develop clientelism for a few votes, as they shamelessly do, for example.  Urban political parties of all shades are also an example of how they treat the Roma and how they themselves are an obstacle to their social integration.  Friends and friends.
