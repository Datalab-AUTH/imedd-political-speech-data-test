 The responsibilities of all those who governed and govern this country for the large school drop-out rate of Roma students are the same and timeless, as there is no state care to ensure that the educational process is not interrupted.  A complex issue, of course, as many times its continuation is undermined by choices or, if you like, by wrong perceptions of the family itself.  But when we are talking about a real social issue that is identified, when everyone is arguing that the educational process is one of the crucial issues to solve, so that other generations are not lost, then.  The responsibility lies with the state itself because it is necessary to staff the school units with more teachers, so that there is the possibility of personalized assistance, to staff them with other necessary personnel such as social workers, psychologists, the connection of the school unit with the Roma community in each region.  And ensuring close cooperation with the family itself.  These are necessary to be ensured for all pupils, of course, let alone for the Roma, who have increased needs, increased demands of course.  These sound like luxuries.
