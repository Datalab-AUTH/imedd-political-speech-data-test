 We call upon you in the coming elections and in the struggle to strengthen the KKE, a force that you will find next to you and the next day the force that can really look you in the eye.  The power that can be expressed by every working people to express and defend their own right to condemn and punish governments and parties that have brought us to this point, but above all to open the way for a better life, for us, for our children.  And this goal can be fulfilled with the people at the forefront.  And not a spectator, with working people's power, a genuine people's government with the people and the Communist, Greece as the protagonists in the governance of the country.  Thank you.
