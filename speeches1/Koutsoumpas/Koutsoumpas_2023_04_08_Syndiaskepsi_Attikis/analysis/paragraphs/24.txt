	Here we should remember that the last time SYRIZA addressed the KKE with reference to a "post-election" Monday was during the July 2015 referendum when Tsipras and his other allies mocked the Greek people for sincerely asking them to vote NO.  	And the KKE was exposing this maltreatment by Tsipras.  Then in Parliament Mr.  Tsipras had even told us that on Sunday "we will vote the same ballot paper".  In order to get the paid answer that the OXI said by the KKE does not have the same content as its own OXI, the deception of the Greek people.  In fact, we replied to him at the time: "You, Mr.  Tsipras, we don't know where you will be next Monday".
