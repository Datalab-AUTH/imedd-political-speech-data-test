 	The whole of the previous period was marked by the mass, popular and youthful outbreak, which had many qualitative characteristics and strong elements of militancy, collectivity, solidarity, greater confidence - in comparison to the past - in the value of organised struggle.  It frustrated the initial attempt of the government and other parties to impose silence in the name of mourning for the Tempi or to defuse anger and indignation through silent and painless protests. 	The multifarious and shocking mobilizations and strikes, the slogans, the coordination, the calls of the trade unions, the student associations, the student coordinations, other bodies of the mass popular movement, are an example of the inexhaustible power of organization and common struggle that literally shattered the propaganda of various mechanisms that spoke of some general and abstract "collectives" that were in motion or of some "spontaneous movements" that came out of nowhere. 	Certainly the crime in Tempe was the one that made the glass overflow in this period, since it came to be added to a set of other acute working people's problems, such as the criminal management of the pandemic with thousands of dead, the continuous accidents at work, the victims and consequences of major natural disasters (fires, floods, earthquakes) and many others. 	It has been proven once again that with all the bourgeois governments we have known, the state of the brutal dictatorship of capital treats the needs and protection of the people as a "cost" that must be neglected, because it harms profits and the notorious "strength of the Greek economy".  It has been shown that even the exploitation of scientific and technological achievements is based on class-based economic and political criteria.
