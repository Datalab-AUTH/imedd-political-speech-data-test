 	We were able to put it all together: And internal party operation and discussion within all the organs and organizations of the KKE and the KNE and action in the mass workers' - people's movement and ideological - political intervention in the Parliament and among the people, even in a prolonged election period.  We keep this as a legacy and we continue.  	It has been rightly pointed out that in the 43 days remaining until the elections, a great pan-alliance will be needed from everyone and up to the last minute.  This battle is all of ours.  Executives and members of the Party and the KNE, friends and supporters, we give all our efforts to reach as wide as possible. 	This job needs drawing, paper and pencil from all of us.
