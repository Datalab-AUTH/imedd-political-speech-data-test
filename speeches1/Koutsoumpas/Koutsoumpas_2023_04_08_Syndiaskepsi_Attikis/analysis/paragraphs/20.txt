Third: The importance of the steady intervention of the political vanguard on the ground of the deadlocks and contradictions of the capitalist system itself was confirmed, as practically happened with the warnings, revelations, demands of the Party (questions and interventions of the parliamentary group, the KKE deputies in the Parliament, the announcement of the Desk of Railway Workers, the faction that supports the Party and PAME to the railway workers and others), which exposed the fact that everyone knew, everyone knew and that it was a predetermined crime with the responsibility of all the governments, ND, PASOK, SYRIZA, which moved to the EU strategy of liberalising markets, to the pursuit of capitalist competition and profit, both for the private monopoly enterprises and for the state monopolies, all emblematic positions of the notorious Maastricht Treaty created by the current EU. Fourth: It was ensured from the very first moment that there was an objective assessment of the situation, pioneering action to express and formulate militant moods, without any tendency to wait, with the direct participation of our cadres, taking and holding the initiative of movements in the movement. Fifth: The role and the need to elaborate pertinent and penetrating slogans that, especially in such conditions of great mass movement, accumulated anger and indignation, guide and orientate the action of broader forces, but also escalate the struggle and are the ones that have brought us forward to a great extent. Sixth: We worked and acted with great diversity, elements of initiative were manifested that strengthened the popular and youth action itself, while at the same time the ability to trust and act together with workers, popular and youth forces that do not have the same class, militant experience, nor did they have such a similar orientation until then, was judged. Seventh: We sought and to a large extent succeeded in guiding the political party intervention and action of the Party and KNE members in unions, associations, coordinating committees, other bodies, combining mobilizations, rallies, rallies, work stoppages, strikes, party events, meetings, conferences, tours, pickets, from the very first day. Eighth: Our intervention was in a unified direction, but also with the appropriate elaboration of arguments, in order to strengthen the political confrontation with the government of the Southwest, but also to have an open and clear front also with SYRIZA, the other bourgeois parties and opportunism, to reveal what is really and why, where the responsibilities are due, but also what is the need of the perspective that the movement must walk in order to answer the genuine popular question "how to get rid of this situation once and for all".  We have thus confronted both the provocative attempt by mechanisms of the system to slander the Party, and the attempt to integrate and disorient the mobilisations within the limits of simply rearranging the bourgeois political system and any governmental rotation. Ninth: Our intervention as a whole has contributed to incriminating the exploitative system that kills, capitalist profit as the obstacle to the satisfaction of the modern needs of the people.  It was illuminated - perhaps more than ever before - that the profits of capital are the dead of the working class and our people.  An effort was made to weaken the apotheosis of the market, which often accompanied criticism of the state, by showing that the state is the entrepreneurs' state, that the defence of their profits is state policy.
