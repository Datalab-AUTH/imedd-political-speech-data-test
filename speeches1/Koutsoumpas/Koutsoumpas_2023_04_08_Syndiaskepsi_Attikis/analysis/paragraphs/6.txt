	Comrades, With the announcement of the elections, the dilemma of stability has intensified once again.  	But we know very well that for the people, stability is to be able to live on the basis of modern needs and possibilities:- to have salaries, pensions that correspond to these modern needs.  - To have the right to stable work with rights.  - Universal and free access to high quality health, education and sport services that are not commodities.  - Right to rest and recreation, culture and culture.  - Cheap, safe and modern transport.  - Living in a peaceful environment in solidarity with the peoples of the region; Utilizing the achievements of science and technology, which are the creation of the world of work, to meet all these modern needs and not turning them into additional fetters and tools to intensify the exploitation of the many under the stranglehold of capitalist ownership and the profits of the few.
