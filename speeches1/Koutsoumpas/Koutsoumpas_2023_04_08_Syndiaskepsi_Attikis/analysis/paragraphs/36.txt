 Comrades, I wasn't going to say anything in the speech, but I would like to say a word about Varoufakis and Mera25, since he asked us to criticise his positions.  This is exactly what we do.  Because with its very positions it falsifies any notion of radicalism.  This is exactly what it does when, through various neologisms and especially by making debt the main or only cause of crises and people's problems, it seeks to oil the capitalist mode of production itself, a symptom of which is the high state and private debts.  However, the full frontal attack of capitalism is unified and is manifested in the indebted countries, such as Greece, and in the countries with lower debts, such as Germany, or others, where people are mobilizing en masse everywhere.  This is exactly what it does when it cultivates illusions about a supposedly democratic and pro-people "transformation of the EU".
