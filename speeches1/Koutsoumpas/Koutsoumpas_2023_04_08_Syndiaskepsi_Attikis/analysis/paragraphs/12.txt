 Besides, that is why the representative of SYRIZA said in the most resounding way that "in the big issues they have no differences with the Southwest".  Moreover, a number of bourgeois economic staffs, international rating agencies etc. seem not to be worried about the composition of the next bourgeois coalition government, because it will be such whether it is formed on May 21 or July 2.  	They already see that neither in the first election nor in the second election will anyone get self-reliance, it will probably just be a repeated double series of blackmailing the popular vote.  	In any case, the bourgeois staffs, domestic, European and international, are not dramatically worried, since they know that with any government of cooperation, the unpopular program of the next day is already written by themselves.  	What the rating agencies are looking at is not the possible "colour" or the composition of the government, but the fact that there will be a continuation of the policies and the improvement of Greece's fiscal path.  This is what an authoritative urban newspaper wrote on Sunday in a report on how the notorious "rating agencies" view the upcoming elections. 	Some people, mainly from SYRIZA, accuse our Party of saying that we are saying these things, when we are not, that SYRIZA and ND are "day and night".
