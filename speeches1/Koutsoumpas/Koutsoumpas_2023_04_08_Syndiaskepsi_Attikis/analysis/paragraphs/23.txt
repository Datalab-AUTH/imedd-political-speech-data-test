	The workers, the youth know that the KKE has never lied to them.  They know that he will not betray or change the vote and the support they will entrust to him.  This appreciation for our action, positions and attitude must and can become an act of strengthening the KKE everywhere. 	We have repeatedly made it clear that we will not betray this vote of support by giving tolerance or even more so support to any unpopular government, no matter how much it appears in the mask of "progressiveness".  	We know that the pressure, the propaganda, as we go towards the day of the elections will be intensified by the parrots of the system and underground, by spreading rumours, by attacking the Party with all kinds of attacks.
