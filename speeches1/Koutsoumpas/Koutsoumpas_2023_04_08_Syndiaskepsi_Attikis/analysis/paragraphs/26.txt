	SYRIZA is in no way legitimate to ask for our tolerance, "in order for Mitsotakis to leave, as he says".  Why:- It is SYRIZA that sowed the disillusionment in 2015-2019, sent people who participated in the struggles and the movement home, who stained values and ideals in the name of the "first time Left" and finally it was the one that willingly managed the affairs of capital and led to the vindication of the policy of ND-PASOK and the conservatization of parts of the people. - It was SYRIZA that was the best support of the Mitsotakis government, with the "we will settle accounts later", the proposals for "ministers of common acceptance" (which are now being reheated with statements by various members of the government), which voted for more than 50% of the amendments, especially the most emblematic ones. - It was SYRIZA that laundered the liberal ND, accusing Mitsotakis of "leading it astray from its principles and values" - It is SYRIZA that is reclaiming the unpopular baton from ND, to take it even further, because any next government will be worse.  Because it only makes the system of exploitation, the profit of the few and the hostile state of the people worse.
