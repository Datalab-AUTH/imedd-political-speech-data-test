 Comrades, After the elections, the unpopular course that will be followed by the government of any composition is predetermined.  	The programmes of the other parties have already been written with their agreement and signatures from the Recovery Fund preconditions, the hunt for the so-called investment grade, the framework of the notorious fiscal stability, the six-monthly EU assessments.  Overall from the commitments they all have to the objectives of the capital, the EU and NATO imperatives.  	And they're all on the same page.
