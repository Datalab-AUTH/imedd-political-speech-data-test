	They are trying to get away from what their own people are saying by claiming that the KKE supposedly does not care who the next government will be and that it says only strong KKE.  	But they know very well, because we have answered this repeatedly, that we obviously care who the next government will be, precisely because we aspire to be, as always, at the forefront of the people's struggles against the unpopular policies that it will implement. 	But what we are clearly saying is that this should not be the criterion by which the people will go to vote, because whatever the government's shape is, the agenda is predetermined.  - They are the unpopular preconditions of the Recovery Fund.  - It is the EU's guidelines for the "liberalisation" of energy, railways, water, other critical sectors of the economy. - It is the dangerous NATO plans.  - It is the attack on people's homes to prop up the banks, at a time when a new capitalist crisis is brewing.  And much more.
