	With our tool "Rizospastis" we are constantly aware of how the debate evolves from day to day, we catch and immediately exploit new arguments and examples that make our work more evident, convincing and relevant. 	This effort requires patience and art.  We communicate every day with people who come into contact with the Party for the first time and it is logical that they have doubts, reservations, concerns and even disagreements.  They recognise the Party's pioneering action, they agree with our positions on a number of issues, but this does not mean that they know and agree with our programmatic elaborations.  	This is a people we treat with confidence, it is a people who in the majority of the past period, in one way or another, took part in militant processes and our contact with them does not have the elections on the horizon, but looks much further ahead, sees the next ballot box. 	We are fully aware that concerns and doubts do not go away once and for all, but when a person takes the decision to join the struggle, meets the communists, this is the first and big step.  With patience, faith and endurance, we give all our strength tirelessly.  WE'LL MAKE IT TO THE TOP FOR KKKE.  PANDU.
