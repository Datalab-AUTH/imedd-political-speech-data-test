 In the two years since the last Conference for the 21st Congress, we have gone through difficult and to some extent unprecedented situations.  From a great pandemic, which we have faced with a struggle, leading from the very first moment, with the slogan "under the masks, we have a voice". 	We passed through the fire of the outbreak of an imperialist war in our neighbourhood, which is constantly escalating and which from the very first moment the KKE redirected the movement not to choose the camp of imperialist thieves, but to see with its class glasses the need to organise its own struggle against the war plans of NATO and the government, which involve our country in dangerous developments. 	We have gone through natural disasters, an upsurge in foreclosures of first homes, worsening energy poverty, the price of consumer goods, workplace accidents at workplaces with large-scale mobilisations, such as at COSCO, but also for working class rights, as in e-food and elsewhere, and from large mobilisations of artists, teachers, pupils, students, from large strikes and rallies, culminating in the mobilisations for the predictable crime in Tempe, where 57 of our fellow human beings, most of them young people, perished.  	In all this we have stepped forward.  We shouted "only the people save the people".  During these two years the Panspoudashtiki emerged as the leading force in the Universities, the correlation in many trade unions and Labour Centres in Athens, Piraeus, Lavrion and Piraeus was improved.  Also in the teachers' associations of Attica, in most public hospitals of Attica and elsewhere.
