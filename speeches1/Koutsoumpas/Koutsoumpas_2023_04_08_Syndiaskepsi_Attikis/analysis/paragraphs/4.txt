 In order to exhaust every possibility, so that no one of those we know, of those we met in the previous period in the struggles, of those who today are worried about their choice at the ballot box, that we do not discuss specifically the need to strengthen the Party. 	The experience of all of us shows that the most effective way is meetings in homes, in cafes, in event venues and other suitable places depending on the subject, the participants, which are conducive to discussion.  And when they are well organised, each meeting leads to many more, new possibilities are born. 	We take the lead and intervene in the great popular problems that will continue during this period, organizing as a Party thematic events to communicate as widely as possible with new people, but also organizing the struggle within the movement for the development of mass struggles. 	Ensuring that any initiatives are disseminated very widely, with appropriate means of communication.  Organizing all the workplaces, Education, Health, neighborhoods, squares and parks of Attica, with well-organized tours, meetings, speeches.
