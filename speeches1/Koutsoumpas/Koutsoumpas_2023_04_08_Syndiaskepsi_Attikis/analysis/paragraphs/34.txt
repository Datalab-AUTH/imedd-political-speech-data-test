Comrades, Let us not underestimate the following: Because they find it difficult to have a public debate, the forces of SYRIZA are sneakily and underground sowing the following inimitable: "The KKE - they say - as it seems, will be strengthened in the elections anyway, so cast your vote for SYRIZA to come out on top, in case Mitsotakis leaves.".  But we won't allow them to have their way.
