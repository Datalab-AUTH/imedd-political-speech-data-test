 	On the contrary, what "stability", "social cohesion" and all the other things that the other bourgeois parties invoke, the people know from their own experience:- With the constant waves of inexpensiveness plaguing the popular families, such as for example the prices of food and energy-fuel which are constantly rising. - With the firmly fixed wages and the "steady" implementation of the law of Vroutsis-Ahtsioglou that abolishes collective bargaining agreements and three-year terms, determines wages based on the competitiveness of capital, while any drip-feed increases are wiped out and do not give any real breathing space.  While the minimum wage in purchasing power is still below its 2011 level.  It is this law that the salary is determined by the Minister and despite the pre-election fanfare on both sides from the Southwest and Syriza, no one makes a sound that he will abolish it. 	The people know this stability with the steady pace of loans that are constantly reddening and the people's housing being served on the plate of the ravens of the banks and the funds and the rents have become unaffordable with 80% of the salary going to accommodation and food.  	With the policy of ND, SYRIZA and other parties, not only is the legislative framework in favour of banks, crows and electronic auctions not only not affected, but is more shielded.  Even state subsidies for the most vulnerable, lead to the people paying, in all ways and from all pockets, to ensure that the banks profit.  And all this, at a time when the ECB's interest rate hike is creating a new generation of people's red loans.  This explains the fact that everyone else repeatedly rejects the KKE's proposals for a ban on auctions and for substantial relief for the people, including the cancellation of interest and a large part of the debt to the banks.
