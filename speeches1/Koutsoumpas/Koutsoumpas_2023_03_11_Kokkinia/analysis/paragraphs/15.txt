 Just as we did not remain silent as long as we saw and denounced these things in Parliament, we were in front of the workers' struggles for these just demands. 	In the sadness caused by the collision of the two trains, we were filled with anger and stubbornness.  We told the Greek people and the Greek youth that "now is the time for voice and struggle".

We made it our duty to reveal the causes of the crime in the eyes of all workers and youth, against the government propaganda, its parrots in the media, who give a graphic but repulsive macabre recital.  But also in the silencing that SYRIZA is finally doing, adding to the government's narrative of "individual error".
