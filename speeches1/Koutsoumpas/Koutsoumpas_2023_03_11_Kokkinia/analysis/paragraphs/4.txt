 Every man cannot help but feel his stomach tighten, precisely because he knows that this is a predestined crime. 	It's not the bad time, it's not the bad country, it's not the bad moment.  It's the hunt for profit that dominates and murders everywhere, it's the fault of those who rule and govern this country. 	The KKE will give all its forces in the workplaces, in the factories, in the neighbourhoods, in the schools and in the schools, in order to "get the knife to the bone" this time.  We will not let this pass.
