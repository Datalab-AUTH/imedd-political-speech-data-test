  A city that since the 1920s has been tied body and soul to the KKE, as its own history reveals.  The Smyrnians, the Pontians, the Armenians and refugees from other regions, were the first yeast of people who, with their customs and traditions from their lands, despite all the miserable conditions, with only their solidarity as a weapon, managed to create a city that, whenever the people decided to do so, made history. 	Here, where thousands of families uprooted from Asia Minor, the majority of them widows and orphans, desperate not only with what they had already lived through, but also with what they had to face.  It was only through solidarity between them that they managed to build shacks and shanties to live - to survive more properly - on top of each other.  And when the rainy weather flooded the settlement, it was their solidarity with each other that saved the households.
