 The KKE is ready from today to contribute, to take part in such a governance, such a genuine power of the people.  Because it has a programme that focuses only on people and their needs.  A power that gets rid of the drones that live off the labour of the many.  And that is why it will not be stingy in returning the wealth produced by the many to the many.
