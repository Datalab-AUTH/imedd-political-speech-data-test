	In the unions, the associations and the schools, in the working-class neighbourhoods of Piraeus and all over the country, the members of the KKE and the KNE gave all their strength to continue the popular mobilizations that express the anger of the people and the youth.  This is how we arrived at the overwhelming participation of workers, people and youth in the strike last Wednesday all over Greece.  So we continue.  The popular river of anger and rage expressed shows that nothing has been decided yet. 	Comrades, The slogan of our Party, "only the people save the people, walking on the road of subversion with a strong KKE" is reborn and strengthened today.  	This is expressed in all the last days with the concern for the families of the victims in Tempe, with the solidarity that filled the squares with volunteer blood donors for the injured of the accident in Tempe, as before with the overwhelming support for the neighbouring peoples of Syria and Turkey, who were affected by the catastrophic earthquake, mourning tens of thousands of dead.
