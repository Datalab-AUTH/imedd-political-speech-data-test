 For all the honoured dead of our fighting people.  And for the unborn children of Kokkinia and the whole world. 	We'll make it, we'll win.  We will all together, all generations together, pave the way for the great, the beautiful, the thrilling, socialism.  	Honor and glory to the 100 years of life and struggle of Kokkinia, the dreams that will finally take revenge.  	For our best days are not yet lived.
