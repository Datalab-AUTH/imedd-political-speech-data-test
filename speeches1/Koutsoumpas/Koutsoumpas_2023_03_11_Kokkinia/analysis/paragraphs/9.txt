 Who was the first to declare that it is a time for mourning and not for talking about responsibility.  "We'll settle up later", the well-known despicable slogan he used in the pandemic, in Versions 2.  It is logical, of course, since as a government he has backed the "liberalization", the privatization of transport, and it was he who sold TRAINOSE to the Italian monopoly, for a plate of lentils and without terms and conditions of basic safety and protection of passengers.  And they don't have a chip on their shoulder.  The world has taken notice of them too.  How they try to justify themselves.  We are told that they were forced to privatise supposedly because of the commitments and the memoranda.  But it's interesting to see what they do, as the official opposition, now that they are not "forced", not "pressured", as they say.  We have and say: In the pandemic: "We'll settle up later".  In the fires in the North.
