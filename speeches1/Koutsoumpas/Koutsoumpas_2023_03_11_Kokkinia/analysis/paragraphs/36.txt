 In the face of these challenges of the present era, the KKE assumes the great responsibility to lead the working-people's majority, to contribute as a vanguard to the overthrow of the present correlation. 	This path was illuminated by the heroic struggle of the Cosco workers, when against gods and demons, they fought for their right and made an international monopoly retreat.  This way is illuminated by the interventions of the unions and mass organizations of the working-class neighborhoods of Piraeus, which are stepping forward to prevent people from being squeezed out by the auctions.  This is the direction that must be strengthened everywhere, in every workplace, so that everywhere "the people can save the people".  So that the exploiters of the people, the big business groups, the governments and their parties can get a raw deal. 	The KKE assumes the great responsibility, not only to be in front of the struggles to repel new anti-people's measures, to extract conquests, to hear the truth against the mud and the mire of the dominant propaganda.  But above all, for the people to realise the great power they have to determine developments in their favour.  As it is, to some extent these days.
