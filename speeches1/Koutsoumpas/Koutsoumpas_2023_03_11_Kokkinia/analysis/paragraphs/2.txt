kke. gr Speech by Dimitris Koutsoumbas, General Secretary of the KKE at the event for the 100th anniversary of Kokkinia Comrades and Compa√±eras Friends Here, from the Kokkinia of refugees, of Mantra, of the blockade, of the heroic Battle, but also from the Kokkinia that wants its children to live humanly and not "to live by chance", we call for battle, struggle, a call for solidarity and strengthening of the KKE everywhere. 	From here and in all the working people's neighbourhoods of Piraeus, in the port, in the factories, in the offices, in the shops, in the hospitals, in the schools, everywhere, where the heart of the working class, of the popular strata, of the youth beats, we send a strong message in every direction: The KKE will not allow the crime in Tempe to be covered up, the policy that exterminates, murders and kills. 	Besides, the Redness of memory and struggle, 100 years now, a century in total, has proven that it DOES NOT KNOW.
