	Comrades, Today a basic conclusion can be strengthened in broader working-people's forces: We are facing a hostile state for the people.  A state that considers the needs of the people as a cost and appears selectively incapable of solving the problems of the people.  But it is at the same time capable and highly efficient to electronically bid on people's homes and at the same time manually maintain the security systems on trains as if we were a hundred years ago.  This is their notorious "digital modernised state".  This same state appears to be able to monitor and electronically record all citizens, to undermine strikes and suppress demonstrations, while at the same time it appears incapable of protecting us from the consequences of earthquakes, fires, floods and large-scale accidents.  	Because this state counts human life as a cost.  The capitalists' state can change the engine driver, but not the owner, who drives it on the rails of the EU and the capitalist track, as long as it is not overthrown by the determined people themselves.
