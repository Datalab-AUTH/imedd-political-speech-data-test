 I had also mentioned the motto Zas, alone and all of us.  On May 10 first power US Student.  On the twenty-first of May all together with heart and mind for Mr. Epsilon.  We can do it much stronger in the few weeks that remain, we give all our strength, we use every hour, every minute in class, during the break, during reading, during the afternoon walk, so that our call reaches everywhere.  To every student, to every young man and woman, to every child of the people's families.  Good strength, good health, good health, good luck in the race.
