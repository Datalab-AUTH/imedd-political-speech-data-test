 This slogan encapsulates the dilemma facing the youth and the answer must be given every day in the struggle, but also in all the ballot boxes that will be set up in the coming period.  You students will have an additional important opportunity to do so in the student elections on 10 May.  You have the opportunity to make the pan-school a top power again.  This ballot box, which will be set up a few days before the parliamentary elections, will be the first big poll of the youth and they are afraid of you for that.  The government has set up a diversionary game to avoid the debate.
