 They have valuable supporters.  Of course, those your government has ruled and those who also profess to be willing to be ruled again by the so-called small parties or political puppets who have historically been shown to be of great ultimate service to this wretched system.  What to say about PASOK.  His greatest contribution to the youth is that his attitude confirms that the new democracy and SYRIZA, despite their differences, have a common programme for the next day.  New Democracy wants to be in coalition with PASOK.  SYRIZA also wants to be in coalition with PASOK.  PASOK declares that it can co-govern with both of them and no one can finally answer us.  Why they cannot co-govern and new democracy with SYRIZA.
