 In 2011 the minimum wage was 751 €.  12 years have passed since then.  We have lived through a great economic capitalist crisis, we have certainly lived through capitalist growth and on April 2023 an increase came into effect that brings the minimum wage to 29 € higher than in 2011 at the same time that the accuracy has shot up, not the increase, the decrease is in terms of purchasing power.  Today such mockery.
