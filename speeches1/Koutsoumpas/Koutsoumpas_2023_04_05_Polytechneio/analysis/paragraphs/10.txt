 The referendum of no that was held by Mr.Tsipras and his cohorts the other day ended up being this huge NO a yes in 2015 with the logic that there is supposedly a lesser evil being shattered once again.  In France, workers strike and demonstrate in their millions against the anti-insurance reform of the Macron government.  We recall that Macron's election was hailed a year ago by the New Democracy as SYRIZA, PASOK as a victory for democracy, while in the past he was supported by Varoufakis, who even wrote passionately about him in the British Guardian.  And how it treats youth and workers.
