 Result of the commercialisation of housing with tuition fees generalised to postgraduate degrees.  By paying for a pile of materials and other necessities for studies.  Is it not this policy that has downgraded the value of degrees that has turned the acquisition of scientific knowledge into a pile of various supposed qualifications and skills, breaking down the coherence and constitution of curricula, reinforcing the categorisation of departments and degrees.  Thus we are led to a degree for the frame that does not ensure the possibility of practicing the corresponding profession, where graduates have to certify their knowledge every now and then and even in institutions that are not even educational.  The result of the above is the directions for the detachment of teaching competence from the degrees, but also the non-registration of the degrees of dozens of university departments.
