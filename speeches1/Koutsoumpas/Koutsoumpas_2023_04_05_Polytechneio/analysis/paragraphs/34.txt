 Surely this way is not abstinence either.  Of course, not only is the system not afraid of this, but it is even more so for that part of the youth that cannot be convinced at this stage, it prefers to keep these young people aside, both on election day and of course every day.  Let us not forget, let us not forget that the new democracy.  It has been governing well for 4 years with a strong majority in Parliament.  Although the turnout in the last election was over 42%.  If they were afraid of abstention, they would not be indifferent to the calls we have made to them again and again to give a solution so that they can go to vote from the place where they work, the thousands of young people who are already working.  Why the season has opened as seasonal workers in tourism sweatshops.
