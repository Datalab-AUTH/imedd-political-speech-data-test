But where they've really taken it up a notch is in trying to convince us that they're going to meet the need of young people for cheap, quality housing.  The notorious My House programme, for which applications have started, will involve at best 10. 000 people, all and sundry.  Young people paid up to 850 â‚¬.  But even this minimum is pushed at the same time into the clutches of the banks, with loans that they will have to repay for the rest of their lives, given from the money of the governors from the workers' own money that for years the OAED withheld from their wages, without implementing any construction program.  New homes give 500 million to bankers to grant a part of the loan interest-free.  But really, what will all these people be asked to pay for the remaining part of the loan, which will be paid off in a few months?  Those who have a mortgage loan from the increase in interest rates are now required to pay up to 3 additional instalments per year.
