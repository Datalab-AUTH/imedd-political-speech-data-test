 So that the parties that will make up the next anti-people's government are as weak as possible, so that such a government will tremble when it tries to pass an anti-people's bill and so that the people themselves, the youth themselves, are as strong as possible, but also so that a different path, a different perspective, is finally opened.  For the benefit of the many.  Such a perspective is only given by the KKE's power proposal.  We say it clearly, we are ready when the working class, the people, the youth, decide and choose to take our responsibility in a working people's government where the protagonists will be the workers themselves.  The youth itself and not the political staff of the social parasites of the capitalists in such a power of the workers, the people will not be spectators, just with one vote every 4 years democracy will not stop outside the gates of the factories or the entrances of the department stores and the various companies, every production unit, every university.  Every neighbourhood will be a beehive not only of creativity but also of democracy.
