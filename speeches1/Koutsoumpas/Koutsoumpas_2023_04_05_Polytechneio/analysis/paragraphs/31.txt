Really, this progressive sympathy with the President of Mexico, Mr Varoufakis' Obrador.  How exactly it goes.  You see in the International Front of Realist Throwing there in the middle of the day 25 fits the bourgeois government of Mexico, the government that is painted with the blood on its hands painted with the blood of Mexican and migrant workers.  A few days have passed.  Since at least 39 migrants in that country were burned alive because the police left them locked in their cells when a fire broke out in the detention centre where they were being held.
