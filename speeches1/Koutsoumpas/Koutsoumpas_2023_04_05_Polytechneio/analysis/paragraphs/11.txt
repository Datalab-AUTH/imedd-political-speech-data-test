 The longtime dove of democracy, as they called him here in Athens, but Germany is also shaken by the biggest demonstrations and strikes of the last decades, demanding the signing of collective agreements with substantial increases above inflation.  Against which government are these strikes directed?  Against the so-called progressive government of CP5 and the Greens, something like what SYRIZA wants to do here with PASOK and other democratic forces.  In Finland we have seen a repetition of the much-praised work of the left-wing government, with its policy, which, among other things, put this country in NATO.  Only the day before yesterday this became the main factor in strengthening the right, which came first in Sunday's elections, and the far right, which came second everywhere.  It turns out that the implementation of right-wing anti-people's policies in the name of progress and the left is ultimately the best sponsor of both the frustration of the.  So it doesn't change anything as much as the far right itself.  But it is also a revelation of the forces that identify themselves as progressive in order to hide their strategic convergence.  In the big, important ones with the so-called conservative political forces, moreover.  This common policy also appears on the university campuses.  You know it well and you all live it every day.
