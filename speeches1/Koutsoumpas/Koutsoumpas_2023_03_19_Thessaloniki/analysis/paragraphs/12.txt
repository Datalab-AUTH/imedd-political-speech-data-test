 The people should be powerful with the KKE much stronger and they should be weak, dazed and frightened against it. Only in this way will the way be opened for better days for the new generation, for our people.  Their system is afraid of the anti-systemic vote in the KKE, but the new generation is satisfied with their system. That's why, right now, a lot of young red votes.  Those young people who vote for the first time, to vote antisystemic, against the system of profit and exploitation, to vote for the KKE. Our people and especially the young generation have a great opportunity this year.
