Friends, compañeras and compañeros,In this "evil country", as in all the others, there is a very big contradiction.  On the one hand there is a people, millions of workers capable of producing, creating, highly skilled and experienced, capable of. There is a new generation coming up with momentum, fighting for their education, eager to create and grow, to exploit new technologies and what humanity has created, and on the other side, there are a handful of people, along with their governments, who are trying to limit all this power, to put the brakes on it, to subjugate it within the framework of their profit, who see young people and young people only as the necessary accessories and tools to achieve the coveted capitalist development, who see the rights of youth, of young workers, as an obstacle to their profits. That's why many feel suffocated within these boundaries.  This is why many young people today see their knowledge and skills not rewarded with decent wages, hours and working conditions.  That's why many can't even work in their field, in what they studied or spend many years practicing it.
