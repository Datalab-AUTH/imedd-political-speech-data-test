 And "let's not forget. "The struggles of the youth must grow stronger now that the clouds are thickening over the capitalist economy, that the cannons of the big banks are bursting one after the other, that precision and inflation have swallowed the new increase - mockery announced by the government in the minimum wage before it is even given. Not to mention the bad time passes that have become a joke among young people.  But this is their growth and it prepares them for their next crisis. Friends, the KKE proposal speaks of a state radically different from the current hostile state that our people have faced all these years.  For a state that, as much as it suits them to put the blame on it in a general and vague way, reproducing the jokes that "there is no state" or talking about the "bad old state", in reality it does exist and is very capable. It is a state capable of monitoring parties and whoever it needs to, but incapable of following the course of two trains.  It is capable of carrying out instant electronic auctions, recording in detail all debts to the tax authorities, but unable to have electronic systems for the railways. It is capable, where necessary, of speeding up and bypassing the "bureaucracy" of the "bureaucracy". Ï‡.
