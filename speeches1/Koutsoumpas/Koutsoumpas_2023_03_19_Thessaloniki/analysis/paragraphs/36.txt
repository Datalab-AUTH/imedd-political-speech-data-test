And that option is only the JRC.  Because, especially now, it is the only vote that is the natural continuation of the very massive youth mobilisations.  It directly strengthens the voice of youth in the Parliament as well. It is certain that this vote will return to the struggle that every young person gives in their everyday life for their rights. But also because it is a vote that is incompatible with the subjugation and the unpopular one-way street that this system cultivates, of punishment towards those who brought us here and prepared the crime in Tempe, of revealing the truth about everything that happens against the people, honesty and trust in the power that the people and the youth hold in their hands, disobedience to those who call on us to show "prudence" and "restraint", hope and optimism to strengthen the struggle for an overall better life. Besides, the "NEVER AGAIN" that our people shouted at the ballot box has a ballot paper.  The ballot paper with the hammer and sickle of pride and disobedience.  The ballot paper of the KKE. Because, contrary to what the various well-wishers and sudden "friends" of the youth try to tell them, the verse "Well, whatever the stars are, I'll take out my tongue on them" is absolutely true for the young people of this country. "So we'll get their tongues out too: now JCE. Thousands of young votes to give a big political blow to this system, to make everything that others fear, everything that we hope and dream of come true.  To turn into a rushing river, like the popular rivers that poured into the streets of all Greece. Become an unyielding fight for a better life.  Because only the people can save the people, on the road of subversion, with a much stronger KKE. Â».
