 The new generation both knows and has its own experience to judge. He knows that the criminal policy has a common signature with that of the New Democracy and that of Syriza.  He knows that whenever he chose the so-called lesser evil, the greater evil came.  Why the 2nd memorandum of ND brought the 3rd of SYRIZA.  And the SYRIZA government, brought the "more evil" of Mitsotakis and off again from the beginning.  She knows that every law that put its stamp on her life was prepared by one to be completed by another. This is what happened with the equating of university degrees with colleges, with the law on strikes, with the Hatzidakis law, with the school - examination centre, with the country's involvement in the war in the plans of the USA and NATO.
