 This time after the elections to be counted and get out those less.  Not to get the "pips" and the votes to build the next unpopular government. To expose themselves more, to "burn" the cards they have up their sleeves, to have a weak anti-people's government and a much stronger KKE, together with the people, to confront them.  Not to be able to easily pass the next unpopular measures they are planning.  To strengthen the organized struggle nationwide, everywhere, to claim all that our people deserve in the 21st century.  To intensify the conflict with the whole policy, the strategy of this system that wants the people in the corner.  So we can hope for truly better days.
