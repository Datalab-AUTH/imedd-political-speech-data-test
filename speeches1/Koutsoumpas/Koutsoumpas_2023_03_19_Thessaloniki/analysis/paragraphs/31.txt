 And it makes sense, since these parties have the same strategy, so they are communicating vessels. But also the "Hellenic Solution" formation of Velopoulos, which is mainly active here in Northern Greece, is it not a collection of temporarily disillusioned New Democrats who are ready to cast their votes for a more "right-wing" government? Besides, Mr.  Velopoulos knows about them.  He had given his vote, before he set up his own shop, to the coalition of the Southwest - PASOK - LAOS government as a member of the LAOS at the time, and then he supported the coalition with PASOK in 2012-2015 as a member of the Southwest, to which he moved.
