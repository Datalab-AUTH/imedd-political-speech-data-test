Our people cannot forget what history has recorded and what history has recorded.  And because 80 years ago, these days, from the old railway station, the Jews who were here in Thessaloniki, Greek citizens, the Nazi German conquerors were loading the trains to take them to the Holocaust, to the crematoria, to Dachau and Auschwitz in Germany.  This is what today's fascists also glorify and we must remember this today. Our people must speak out again, both in elections and in the struggles, to send all the Nazis - no matter what they call themselves - to the grave once and for all. There is also the experience of abstention, which now, many are selling it as a so-called choice that supposedly bothers the system and "scares" it.
