 	That is why they seek to place the burden of raising a child on the parent whose interruption of work for a few months is not an obstacle to the needs and profitability of capital.  Such is their "sensitivity" for the support of motherhood that the government of the Southwest, as the government of SYRIZA did in the past, rejected the relevant very important amendment of the KKE.  	It is an amendment that provided for the abolition of the unacceptable provision, which sets as a condition of leave and maternity allowance, the completion of 200 points in the last 2 years, thus excluding thousands of working mothers from basic protection measures.  	They also rejected the KKE amendment on self-employed women professionals and scientists and on women farmers.  That is, they rejected the maternity leave allowance 2 months before and 6 months after childbirth, regardless of insurance coverage, at the level of the minimum wage with the responsibility of the state, with simultaneous exemption from social security contributions. Dear friends, The struggles of working women can find a way out in the positions of the KKE, which is not bound by the capitalist employers and the corrupt EU.   This is why the KKE is stepping forward.
