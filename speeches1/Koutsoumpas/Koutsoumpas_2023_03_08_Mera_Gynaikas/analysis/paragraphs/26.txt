 We wholeheartedly support the need for financial, legal and advisory support from the state. 	We are building a shield of protection for every woman who has suffered abuse, who has been confronted with violence in the workplace and in her personal life.  The provisions of the Hatzidakis law on violence and harassment in the workplace, voted not only by ND, but also by SYRIZA, PASOK.  	Their sensitivity is not primarily about protecting workers from employer violence and terrorism, but about limiting costs to business.  They say violence and harassment "are incompatible with promoting sustainable business".  		In fact, the employer is responsible for the necessary prevention and protection measures, i.e. the employer, who in his position can use violence, even sexual harassment.  	What support has been given to the "mouths that have opened" and denounced these behaviours in the workplace.  The evidence is telling.
