		In the face of this reality, both the current government of the New Democracy and SYRIZA claim that with their policies they are putting an end to "institutions" and strengthening family-type alternative care.  It is provocative to try to bring them into conflict.  They are trying to cover up their own criminal, highly abusive responsibilities for the tragic situation and the dramatic shortages of permanent staff in public sector structures.  And at the same time, they are embellishing private sector structures, NGOs.  	Equally reactionary are the changes of the government of the Southwest in the institutional framework of child fostering.  They stepped on the law of SYRIZA, which institutionalized the foster parent with a contract and the institution of the professional foster parent.  It is unacceptable that fostering, as the highest act of altruism, should become a profession.  The position of the KKE is that the support of unprotected children must be the exclusive responsibility of the state.  Scientific, social responsibility for the appropriateness of fostering and childbearing by a multidisciplinary team is necessary, and not on the basis of narrow economic criteria.   The simultaneous existence of modern public child protection structures is necessary until the child is integrated into a quality and safe family environment.
