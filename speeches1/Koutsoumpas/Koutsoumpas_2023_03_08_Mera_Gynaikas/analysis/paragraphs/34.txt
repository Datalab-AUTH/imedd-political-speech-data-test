	In the face of an increasingly reactionary system, the KKE's proposal to the women of the working-people's majority is a radically different path of development.  A road that puts the working man, woman and man, the child, the pensioner, and the satisfaction of their ever-expanding needs at the centre of the road. 	Our program for worker-people's power and governance is based on social ownership of the means of production, with scientific central planning of social production and social services. 	With the KKE we open the way to free ourselves from the grip of capitalist profit, exploitation and oppression, with the people in power and the owner of the wealth they produce.  For the society of true freedom, socialism-communism, where every woman can be liberated from economic and social constraints.  	On this ground, women's equality and mutual respect between men and women can flourish, relations free of all economic and social dependence.
