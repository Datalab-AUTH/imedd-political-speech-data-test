	This sensitive sector cannot be left in the hands of all kinds of private individuals, NGOs, businessmen, ecclesiastical institutions and various "philanthropists", with the tragic results we all know. 		We will not settle for today's brutality.  We are fighting to break the "vicious circle" of exploitation, multiple violence and discrimination against women, children.  We reach out to the families of the murdered women who are living a real Calvary.
