 In the KKE we are in favour of the joint responsibility of parents, the effective participation of both in the upbringing and care of the child.  This need, of course, also arises from the objective changes in the working and living conditions of young parents themselves.  As a Party we tabled specific proposals and amendments to effectively support parents, particularly divorced parents, to deal with these complex issues in the best interests of their children... which were rejected by others.  We demand free counselling and other social services, such as family and couple therapy programmes, parent and child counselling.  At the same time, we are fighting for the financial support of divorced parents, with tax relief, with benefits.
