 on International Women's DaySpeech by Dimitris Koutsoumbas, General Secretary of the KKE KKE Central Committee, at an event of the KKE Central Committee on International Women's DayCompa√±eras and comrades, Friends and friends, We would like to take this opportunity to salute the overwhelming, massive and magnificent participation of the people and youth in the strike rallies from all over Greece. 	In particular, we want to salute the tens of thousands of pupils and students who, with their youth, their determination and their clear vision, flooded the streets and squares in all major cities and shouted with conviction "this crime will not be forgotten". 	Yes, it will not be forgotten, we will see to it, all of us, all of us.  	So today, International Women's Day, the shadow of grief and anger casts a heavy shadow over the tragic train accident in Tempe.  	Seeing the eyes of mothers, fathers, relatives, friends, flooded with pain for the lost children, we grit our teeth because we have no right to remain silent.
