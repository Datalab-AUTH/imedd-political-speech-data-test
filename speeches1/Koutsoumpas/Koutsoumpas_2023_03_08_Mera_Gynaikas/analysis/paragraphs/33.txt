 		Trust the KKE in the elections, just as you trust the members of the KNE in the schools, in the schools, in the workplaces.  Whatever the youth has conquered, it has achieved through its struggles, with the forces of the KKE and the KNE leading the way, without waiting for governmental saviours "from above".  With the first red vote, the young woman can become a protagonist on the road to real equality and emancipation.  It is up to each and every person, who is angry and indignant, to fight militantly so that: this society that gives birth to miraculous monsters, that man forgets what it means to be human, that man forgets, is finally and irrevocably put in the "trash can" of history.  These are the words of the great Bertold Brecht, in the play 'Antigone', which we will have the pleasure of enjoying immediately afterwards.
