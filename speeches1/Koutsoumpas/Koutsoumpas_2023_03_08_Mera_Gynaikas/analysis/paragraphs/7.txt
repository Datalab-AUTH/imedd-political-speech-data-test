	Every vote for the KKE that is taken away from the bourgeois parties weakens the full frontal attack of the next government and the business groups on our rights, on our income, on our lives.  	The stronger the KKE, the stronger the workers', people's demands, the stronger the opposition to the anti-people's policy.  The stronger the people become to put obstacles in the way, to wrest conquests.  The weaker the bourgeois political system of injustice and barbarism will be.  	In the run-up to the elections, both ND and SYRIZA, as well as PASOK and the other parties, intensify the false dilemmas and blackmail.
