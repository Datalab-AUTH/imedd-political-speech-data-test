 A woman is forced to either wait months in the understaffed specialised departments of public hospitals, or visit private mega hospitals.  	We cannot reconcile the modern needs of prevention, care, rehabilitation of Health and Mental Health with the "cost" for the state, capital and the "benefit" for the business giants.  The KKE plays a leading role in the struggles for the free coverage by the state of all the costs of diagnostic examinations, medically assisted reproduction, prenatal check-ups and childbirth, without any entrepreneurial action.  We defend the right of every woman to contraception, to abortion, with the necessary free scientific, social support and protection of reproductive health.   For any individual choice to be meaningful. 		We do not accept the postponement of the necessary measures for the full support of the family.
