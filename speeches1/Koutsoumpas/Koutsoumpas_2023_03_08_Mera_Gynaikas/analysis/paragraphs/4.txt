 	All this is related to the choices of the EU, to the interests of the capitalists in Greece, as expressed in the respective policies of all bourgeois parties and governments.  That is why they are not entitled today to talk about the "unique exception of delay" in Greece.  Nor are they entitled to blame each other, detached from the totality of their choices.  	As a Party we look into the eyes of every woman who is angered by such moments.  Every employed and unemployed, self-employed, self-employed, freelancer, every young mother who wonders how she can feel secure for herself and her children.  	It is our duty towards the victims of the crime in Tempe, towards our children, to strengthen the current of struggle against politics and the state that leave the people and their children unprotected, because they protect the competitiveness and profitability of the conglomerates. 	That is why every woman has before her a crucial and decisive choice for her future.
