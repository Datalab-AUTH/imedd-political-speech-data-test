 In order not to let the predestined crime be forgotten, covered up.  	Because what hurts us and shocks us is not a one-act play, only to look for what went wrong, who did not play their role properly... The workers' warnings leave no room for second thoughts.  	The new tragedy is the result of a long chain of decisions, laws and directives - European and Greek - that were jointly passed and implemented by the bourgeois parties that ruled.  That is, the New Democracy, SYRIZA, PASOK, promoting the liberalization of rail transport work on the basis of business-capitalist profit.  Related to this criterion is the fact that the railway infrastructure remained in the hands of the State.  This is the criterion by which the development of fixed-track transport in Greece lagged behind.  	The maximum possible safety with the use of modern scientific and technological means, the recruitment of permanent, properly trained staff, were cut down on the basis of "cost" both for the purely privatized parts of the railway and for those managed by the urban state.  	All this works against the need of workers and youth for safe, cheap and modern transport.  	But these are not the choices of a single government, a single Minister.  It has to do mainly with how competition and the shares of the monopolies in Europe, in the whole capitalist world, have been shaped over time.  It affects whether and how much sea, road, rail and air transport develops.
