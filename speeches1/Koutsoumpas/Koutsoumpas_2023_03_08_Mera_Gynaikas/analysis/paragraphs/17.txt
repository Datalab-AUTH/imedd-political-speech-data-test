  Both the government of the New Democracy, as well as SYRIZA and PASOK before it, proclaim, despite any differentiations, that the stability of the economy, the explosion of investments, will benefit us all.  	But the reality is that the bloody road of capitalist growth has as a precondition the reduction of state funding for public social structures.  Everything that is necessary to support the family is almost exclusively the responsibility of the individual.  	The "investment opportunities", i.e. the provocative support of capital with new incentives and privileges, are even conditional on cutting state expenditure: - on pensions, - on benefits for the disabled, - but also on family allowances, - on care for the elderly, - on health, medicine.  	At the same time, they support entrepreneurship in these sectors in many ways.  The example of medically assisted reproduction and reproductive health is a case in point.  	The new framework was recently passed by ND, PASOK, with the tolerance of SYRIZA.
