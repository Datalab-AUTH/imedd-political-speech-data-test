 Despite the superhuman efforts of the workers in these structures, who work on annual contracts for years, a woman has many obstacles to overcome to get back on her feet, to free herself from an abusive relationship.  The KKE fights steadfastly against the factors that give birth to the perpetrators - "monsters" and leave women unprotected against the heinous and horrific crimes, sexual violence and abuse, up to the point of femicide. The KKE unconditionally supports the tightening of the criminal framework and the criminal treatment of crimes of violence against women, based on the motive of the perpetrator.  It categorically condemns any instance of impunity or attempts to let the perpetrators of such heinous crimes off the hook.
