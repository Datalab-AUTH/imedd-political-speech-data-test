 Because every woman, who is worried about her parents, needs high-quality, public and free open or closed hospitality and care services for the elderly and severely disabled. In order for a new mother to feel stability and security, she needs modern, public and free cr√®ches, creative activity centres for children, especially disabled children, modern and safe school accommodation.

NONE.
