 Mr. E or has been and will be by their side, but right now it requires the whole region to show determination that the plans that others have will not go through and determination means that we will not allow him to lose his job either.  One worker, we will not allow a single house to be auctioned.  We will not allow the blackout to happen to any popular household.  We will demand that measures be taken, that infrastructure be created to serve security, everyday life, the needs of the people.  We can with our struggles, but also with our political choices.  We can.
