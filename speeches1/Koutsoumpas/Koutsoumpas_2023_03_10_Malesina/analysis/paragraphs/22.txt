They never exploited possibilities such as the trillions of cubic metres of hot water that have fallen into the Gulf of Evia that could warm the region in winter and give cheap energy to large greenhouse plants, for example, which would also employ thousands of workers. Here's how many drugs are produced in our country and at the same time they are missing from pharmacies here's the situation they have put the small shopkeepers in.  We see here the landscaping of the square and this square and the square's square at a considerable cost, even to put cement on top of cement.Have the professionals who have their shops around the squares been asked at all what exactly they propose, so that everyone has the same opportunity to create a space where workers can come with their children to drink their coffee, to drink their cigarettes, so that there are places where the children can come and drink their coffee, to have their cigarettes, to have a place where the children can have their coffee, to have their cigarettes, to have a place where they can drink their cigarettes, to have a place where they can have their coffee, to have their cigarettes.  They will play safely.
