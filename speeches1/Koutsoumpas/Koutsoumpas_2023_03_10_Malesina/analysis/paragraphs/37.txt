 But on the other hand, we have had the worst opposition in recent years and the worst opposition of SYRIZA and behind it that of PASOK, it is not enough that in any race.  Not only have they not stepped forward, but they have been singing back to the people, telling them that when they come out again at some point this government will solve the problems as if we haven't seen their hairstyles as if they didn't rule or co-govern conditions as if they didn't vote for memoranda that they implemented all together and each one individually, but that's not enough, but completely shamelessly SYRIZA has voted.  And 50% of the laws that the government has passed in the Parliament during this four-year period, while PASOK has passed 70% of these laws.  In fact, all these laws are the laws that flatten rights, flatten the life of the Greek people.  LARCO is the best example for conclusions.  The Communist Party of Greece submitted 3 proposals for laws for the reopening of LARCO to secure all jobs in none of them, but in none of them SYRIZA and PASOK avoided to meet the unions, because we know that there is experience and that they will be cornered.  They did exactly the same thing for bills but tabled by Mr.  Î•.   for accuracy, for the reduction of VAT on fuel and food, for the reduction of the price of electricity for popular households, for the restoration of collective labour agreements, for the restoration of holiday bonuses, for the holiday allowance to all workers and pensioners.
