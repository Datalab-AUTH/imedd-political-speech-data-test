 On the one hand the workers, with the solidarity of other workers from all over Greece and abroad, and on the other hand the government of the New Democracy, the other parties that ruled the parties that support business interests, such as the New Democracy, SYRIZA and Bazon, their investors, the mechanisms that have in various municipalities and regions the decisions of the Commission of the European Union and all the laws that they have passed in Parliament over time.  And yet the workers of LARCO have broken every record of endurance or are close to victory.  The government, under the pressure of the political cost of this struggle, has been forced to commit to renewing the contracts until the end of the year.  Despite the predictions and the government's words that said that in 6 months they would be out of the woods for not having to give them even 1 â‚¬ for compensation, even though they had voted for it, the workers managed to get the laws.  This not to be implemented, change.  She is still standing inside LARCO and they are struggling to relight her fuse.
