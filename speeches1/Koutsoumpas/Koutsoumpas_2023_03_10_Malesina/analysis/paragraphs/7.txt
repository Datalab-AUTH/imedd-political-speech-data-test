 And the region of LARCO and we and you and all of Greece are really angry about those who have ruled all these years.  We are angry against a policy that all these people have consciously implemented, in the direction of the European Union, of course, namely the policy of privatisation, of competition, of the rise, as they say, of their own growth indicators. With their politics, they all led us to the end of the line children who never reached their destination parents who will never see their offspring again.  Young people hungry to chase their dreams and parents who toil daily to help them on this journey.  Justifiably with this situation they were terrified.
