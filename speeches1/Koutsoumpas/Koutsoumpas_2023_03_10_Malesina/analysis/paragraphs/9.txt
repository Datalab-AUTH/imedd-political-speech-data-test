 We are here tonight in a region that has paid with deaths for the policy that all of them have implemented so far.  Governments know that we are in a region that has heard things over the years to pass this unpopular policy without reaction.  Think about what they said.  For so many years now, the governors and their various parrots in order to proceed with the policy of liberalisation and privatisation of the railways, that the railways are loss-making, that the workers are state-owned, that it must be privatised because the Greek taxpayer pays, that with privatisation there will be investments and we will have safe trains with cheap tickets, that growth will come and jobs will be created.  Does this remind you of anything.  Because they said much the same as we all know about LARCO that LARCO is a loss-making barrel without a bottom, that the workers are spoiled and well paid, they sit and get paid, they live in the settlements and have refrigerator conqueror coolers, that LARCO should be privatized to relieve the Greek taxpayer, that investors will modernize the obsolete facilities.  To operate it safely at work and with respect for the environment and that growth will come with many jobs.
