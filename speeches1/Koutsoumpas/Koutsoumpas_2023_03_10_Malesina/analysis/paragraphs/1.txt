To begin with, this tragic event in the mosques and what followed.  The huge, unprecedented for the last few years, mobilisations that continue throughout the country, the hundreds of thousands of strikers of last Wednesday.  The outbreak and the stubbornness of the youth of students all over Greece, but also here in the prefecture of Fthiotida fill us with hope and optimism.  All those who strike are demonstrating all those who participate in the initiatives, in schools, colleges, universities, workplaces.  They really become the voice of the dead of the tragedy of Tempi.
