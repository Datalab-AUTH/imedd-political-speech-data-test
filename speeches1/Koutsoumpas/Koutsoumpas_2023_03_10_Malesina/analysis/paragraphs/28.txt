In all cases, the abandonment, the devaluation, the subordination of the state to the interests of the few is highlighted each time.  In all cases, the way in which governments are linked to the interests of various business groups, that is, to the profits of the few, is highlighted, and this link is the matrix that gives rise to kickbacks and corruption.  In the railways, the provocative concession contracts concluded and signed by all these governments are an eye-opener.In LARCO, the waste of millions by all the governments, the conscious abandonment to demolish it and give it away for a plate of lentils, so that the furnaces have been extinguished and the workers do not know if and when it will be reopened.  The railways and LARCO are typical examples, as are the shipyards in our country, ELVO, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications.  The PPC and overall infrastructure given by all governments for the benefit of business groups. All these were sold.
