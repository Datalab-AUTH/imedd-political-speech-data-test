 They do everything they can to be in the workplaces in the towns and villages every day, they do everything they can to highlight the problems, demand solutions and step forward to implement them.  Because the people also need associations like LARCO, associations that will highlight culture, the sporting spirit, customs, popular entertainment, they need municipal councillors, mayors, regional governors, elected by the ballots of the People's Coalition who have a position with documented proposals for every village, every municipality in the region, in all the problems. It doesn't need MPs who vote to red the houses, the banks and if they buy the red loans and their crows.  It needs MPs to stand in front of every bailiff to cancel auctions to block the crows of banks and other business groups.  The people do not need MPs and ministers whose bills condemn the young, the workers, the pensioners, but they need those who reveal to the people the unpopular content of the laws and organise the struggle for their final abolition.  It does not need MPs and ministers who raised their hands and voted to close LARCO to cut the wages and rights of workers and thus condemned an entire region.  It needs Members of Parliament.  Where will they sleep day and night at LARCO, carrying the problems, the demands to the Parliament and organizing the front against the business interests that want to exploit this whole area and the workers to be unemployed or on starvation wages We also hear those who say.
