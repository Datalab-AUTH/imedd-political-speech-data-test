 There is a struggle and it must continue, but a struggle that will take them and lift them and their governments and their state.  All in all, this rotten and corrupt system of theirs must be settled in the thought and action of each and every one of them.   So let the government of the New Democracy, Mr Mitsotakis, not hope that he will avoid condemnation because he postpones a few days to the elections and breaks it in May.  The Greek people, the Greek Youth, do not have such a short memory, which is exactly why let's not hope that the rest of the people, the others, SYRIZA, PASOK, will get away with it, all of them clean.
