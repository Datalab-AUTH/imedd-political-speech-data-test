 Surely because they say the same thing for years now about the crimes at LARCO in la Gi that the day before yesterday the chimney that was again emitting black smoke all the time, they say the same thing in all places of work.  Human error workers have developed a culture of familiarity with risk and do not observe protective measures.  Those responsible will be punished.  We will take measures to prevent it from happening again. We will support the victim's family.  This is not what we hear every day now on the TV channels 10 days after the crime, this is what we read in the newspapers.  That's not what the journalists say, that's not what the others from the other parties say.
