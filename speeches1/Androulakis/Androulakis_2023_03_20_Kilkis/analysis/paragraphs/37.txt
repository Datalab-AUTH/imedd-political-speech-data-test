 The dilemma is.  Or a state prey to the hands of the rulers of the day.  Or a state.  Guarantor of the public interest with a strong mandate from the Greek people.  I guarantee that we will build a state.  A guarantor of the public interest, which will be transparent, meritocratic, respectful of the taxes of the Greek people, utilizing European programs, the Recovery Fund will create modern infrastructure.  The public sector will have evaluation, meritocracy and the private sector and powerful interests will operate by rules.
