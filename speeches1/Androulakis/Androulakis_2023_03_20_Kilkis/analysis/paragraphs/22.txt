 I want to remind you.  What happened in the TV licence case.  When Mr Mitsotakis was saying, what we are saying today.  I was saying the same things we say today.  Mr Mitsotakis was talking about SYRIZA.  And he was saying that this competition is a stock-sharing game of the new democracy.  What we also believed in strong interests, which he proved with his decision.
