 So this, dear friends, is not a staff state that guarantees the basics, it is a staff state of audacity and cover-up alone.  The priority is for the current government not to face up to its responsibilities, but this is not the first time.  This is the first time this has happened.  Didn't the same thing happen on the issue of wiretapping.  Where after decades we suddenly find ourselves in front of phenomena that we believed that Andreas Papandreou's PASOK, the democratic party, would have been closed in the dustbin of history and here we are again facing interceptions and attempts by modern means to imprison me and other people.  People in very critical positions in the state.  As are the armed forces.
