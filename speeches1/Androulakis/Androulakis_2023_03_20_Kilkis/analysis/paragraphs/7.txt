 On a kilometre basis across the European Union.  In 2019, in March, before the elections, Mr Mitsotakis himself, at a New Democracy event on the New Democracy programme, was saying and showing the real situation of the network.  Of course, that didn't stop him from talking about hydrogen trains a few years later that he was going to include them in the Recovery Fund.  And of course as Mr Tsipras before Mr Mitsotakis was talking about the silver train that they were going to bring to these networks, which could not even guarantee the safety, the basic safety of the citizens.  The European Commission is coming soon.  A few weeks before this shocking accident.  And sends us to the European Court of Justice.  We had not managed to get the cooperation legislation in place between the rail regulator.
