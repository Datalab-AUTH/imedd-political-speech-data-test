 We will build a highly interconnected network that will connect Greece with each other and between third countries from Africa and the European Union.  And it will then make energy communities of farmers, livestock producers, processors, so that our producers produce the electricity they consume and as much as they don't consume, they sell it back to the grid.  Because others are doing it and we didn't do it, because we had priority.  The Lords of the New Republic August 12, not to build the Recovery Fund strong grid to make hundreds of energy communities into community municipalities and producers, but had priority August 12 what was left of the grid in the interconnection area.  Give it only to the powerful.
