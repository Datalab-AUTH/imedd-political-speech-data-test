 This is the Greece of social justice, not social justice.  This is the Greece that prioritizes the political system to get along with the domestic oligarchy.  So, we are planning a just green transition, so that the big urban centres of Athens and Thessaloniki know that our priority is that the poor Greek people should not be led again to energy impoverishment through rising energy prices.  And so to put photovoltaics on the roofs as a priority we say in the Greek region, in every city, in every village all the parks to be done on social terms, so that people can get cheap electricity.  We are not a country that has a rich sun.  Rich sea.  So why don't we use all these technologies for the benefit of the many, but use them for the benefit of the few?
