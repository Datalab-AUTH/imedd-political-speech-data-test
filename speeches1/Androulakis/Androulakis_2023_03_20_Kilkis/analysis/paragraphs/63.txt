 Is it also possible that the European Union wants to support and say, take 32 billion from the Recovery Fund, 20 billion in subsidies, 11 billion in loans.  And while other governments make a special funding body.  And they are giving the Recovery Fund loans, not by market criteria, because by market criteria those who were borrowing before are borrowing now at a lower interest rate.  I said the figures in Heraklion 68 companies have taken a huge percentage from the Recovery Fund with 1.1 and 1.2 interest rate.  But Europe didn't give them that money.  Gifts for SMEs at risk of closure.
