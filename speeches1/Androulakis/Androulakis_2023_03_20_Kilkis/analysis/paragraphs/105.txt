 So that's why.  The message is clear, I don't expect anything from the powerful because I have nothing to offer to the powerful.  I expect a lot from you, because together we can succeed and build a modern country, a European country, a country of a strong deterrent power in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, a country where no one can harm its national interests, a country with modern European infrastructure, a country with a strong social state of health and education, without inequalities, with many opportunities for the next generations, a country with a strong social state of health and education, a country with many opportunities for the next generations.  That makes hope a reality again and that is why I call you to a strong daily struggle, a few days left, a few weeks left, so that on the night of the national elections we, from the winners' shore, send a clear message of change to the losers of the right and SYRIZA.  This is PASOK.
