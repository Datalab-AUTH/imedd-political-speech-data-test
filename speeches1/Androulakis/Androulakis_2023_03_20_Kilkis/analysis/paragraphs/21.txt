 The new democracy, SYRIZA or PASOK, not only did not bring them, but they fought them fiercely in the Greek Parliament, discrediting every effort of meritocracy and transparency.

Its reforms, its quality, its culture of respect for institutions and democracy.  Because we are the ones who not only created the independent authorities, we respected the independent authorities.
