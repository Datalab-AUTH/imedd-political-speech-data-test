 Our fellow citizens took a Swiss loan.  Which are now at risk because the interest rate has increased too much due to the exchange rate change.  We propose that 1/3 of the exchange rate change, as translated into the interest rate, should be borne by the banks themselves and 2/3 by the banks and we say this because there was experience of the Swiss yen, but they did nothing to inform and protect the borrowers.  These proposals are proposals, because we want to make a policy that will give breath to the real economy.
