 They have learned to assassinate the character of the messenger.  But Georgiou was vindicated.  And you can be sure that we will be vindicated because we are fighting for the stage and consistency because we want Greece to change and become a normal European state that respects human rights, where justice will function normally and where there is the rule of law for all Greeks.  So I didn't see these two unrepentant Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis say a word about Georgiou, proving that their priority is not to change the country, their priority is to say and do.  Everything that can be done to get them back in the prime minister's chair.  But.  The position of the Prime Minister is very critical in a Prime Minister-centric system.  Which also needs to change in the future.  There are serious counterweights to the functioning of our democracy.
