 There will be justice and not when you are strong always find your right even when you are wrong.  But when you're powerless.  Trying to find your right, but most of the time being lost.  This country does not deserve the Greek people.  This state is not the state we aspire to, the state of the twenty-first century.  And that's the problem.  An expensive state with expensive services but of very poor quality and this was proven in the crime of Tempe.  Why we need to be honest.
