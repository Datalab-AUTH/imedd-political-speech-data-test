 I'm trying with this particular speech.  To show another way, but this way is not a way of compromise.  It is a road of conflict.  And if some people think there will be national elections.  And then a coalition government will be formed to become prime ministers.  They probably don't know what the current and new era of PASOK.  PASOK will get a strong mandate.
