 The big issue for us in the national elections is the big change.  It is a big bet for me personally and for all of you who have kept the democratic party standing during the difficult years.  The Greek people to feel that we can serve a new change.  A new era.  With a new perspective and with real hope and not with populism and elitism.  So that is why we have as a priority our social democratic programme, which touches all generations, all social classes, but above all the middle class and the weakest Greeks, as has been PASOK's priority since its foundation.  Then with the underprivileged.
