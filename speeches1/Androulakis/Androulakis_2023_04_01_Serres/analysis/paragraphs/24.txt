 They show that these 2 parties and their leaderships, because I don't like to make a universal incrimination, have no limits, they are capable of saying the same and the opposite, of doing what they denounce just to sit in the chairs of power.  So that's why we are asking for a strong mandate because in a coalition government where there is a strong PASOK whose views and programme are a guideline, we would not have eavesdropping either.  No cover-up either.
