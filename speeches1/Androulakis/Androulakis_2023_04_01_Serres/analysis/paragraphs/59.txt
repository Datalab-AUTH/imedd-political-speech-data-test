 A country that wants to use its ports cannot privatise them, but not invest in serious companies to make rolling networks that will connect Greece with the rest of Europe.  So that is why we and because we in Northern Greece must strengthen our country as a geopolitical energy and transport hub, so that the farmer, the farmer, the farmer, the poet knows very well that the big investment is in the cost of production, in transport, in exports and in extroversion, so that your children stay here and do not leave like their grandparents in Germany and other countries.  This is real investment to stop golf in the country.  And of course with the synergies of these sectors with tourism.  We cannot say that we have 25 million tourists in Greece every year.  But we'll be a vast hotel.  And the profit will be only for the bed only for housing, a little bit for feeding, but for no other sector of the economy.  So we say measurable targets like Spain and Portugal.  We need to set targets.  The majority of millions of travelers to taste Greek oil, Greek wine, processed agricultural products, not just 10 days in Greece, but 365 days in all their countries of origin and to relive a time of recovery, a time of dignity, competitiveness of production indicators.  Friends and friends.
