 The green transition.  It's a policy made.  The question is how each Member State will implement it.  It will implement it by enabling hundreds of farmers and livestock farmers and processors to make energy communities, thousands of Greeks to put photovoltaics on the roofs of their homes, or.  It will give all this new business framework to a few powerful construction companies to exploit.  So we are not inventors and we are following models of countries that want a green transition without energy poverty and with energy democracy.  That is why we propose investments in networks.  If Greece invests in the networks here in Serres hundreds of energy communities can ensure farmers, farmers, farmers and processors that in the next 15 years they will have stable production prices and will not be blackmailed by their 2 policy changes.  Energy oligarchs and gas.
