 Friends and friends.  Greece.  It can become a country where its people live in dignity, happiness and prosperity.  It is enough for the political system to speak the language of truth and to change from being a clientelistic programmatic.  This is the very great ambition of the new era of PASOK to make a breakthrough in all that the Greek people have been experiencing in recent years.  Greece went bankrupt in the hands of New Democracy and they are so unrepentant that they can bankrupt it again and Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis, because they do not tell the whole truth to the Greek people, they invest in toxicity, anarchocracy and patronage.  So we want to say to your children who did not live through the good days of PASOK.
