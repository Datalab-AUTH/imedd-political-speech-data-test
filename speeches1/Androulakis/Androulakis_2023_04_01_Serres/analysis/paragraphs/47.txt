 This money is not given by Europe for the known oligarchs to take it.  Neither are the big companies, which are not even the banks' customers anyway.  Europe gave this money to those who today are in the throes of illiquidity who want to be able to get a loan on the basis of jobs, digital growth, synergies, climate change.  So, if the data show that Mr Mitsotakis' priorities are.  69 companies with 1.2% interest rate took 1.1 billion of the Recovery Fund, when thousands of farmers, farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises are in dire straits, this money for them was given by the European Union and not for the cronies of Mr. Mitsotakis of New Democracy.  So that is why we are asking for the issue of loans to be prioritised for small and medium-sized enterprises.  Another point of our programme, private debt.  I said at the beginning of my speech.  Tsipras said stubbornness.  And he handed it all over in 2015.  To the ravens the goal.
