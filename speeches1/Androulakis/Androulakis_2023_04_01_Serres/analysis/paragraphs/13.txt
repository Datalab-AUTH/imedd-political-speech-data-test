 When there are coalition governments, the convergences are also in the faces, especially in the face of the Prime Minister, who must be a person of common consent.  So I will not say who is in a person of common acceptance.  But some people even this simple issue that is happening in many European countries.  Here they have made it a top issue because they do not want to convince the people or the well-known media rulers that the dilemma is Mitsotakis or chaos and we answer here from Serres that Mr Mitsotakis is chaos.  It is social inequalities, it is the devaluation of public wealth, it is interception, it is the violation of human rights, it is the open attack on the principles.  And they look so much alike.
