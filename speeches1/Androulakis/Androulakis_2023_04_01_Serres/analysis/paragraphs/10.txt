 I say this because they get annoyed when we talk about coalition governments, without these prime ministers we do it because we want to build a relationship of trust with the Greek people, telling them the truth, we say what we will do when we get this mandate, what we will do.  Mr Mitsotakis says, I don't care about the first election, vote for this, it's been done before, vote for me, but he'll deliver the mandate then because the Greek people didn't say so.  What to see.
