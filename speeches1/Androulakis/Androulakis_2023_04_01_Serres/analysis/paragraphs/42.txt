 Such is the cost of living that it is prohibitive.  We will fight for a sustainable growth that will increase wages that will have well-paid jobs.  But the big bet is to bring down the cost of living and elements of the cost of living are health, education and housing.  So the second point is strong public education, a lever of social mobility for the children of the Greek people, strong primary education, competitive public universities, research and technology.  The third point is social housing.  Our plan is very simple in all the major urban centres of the country.
