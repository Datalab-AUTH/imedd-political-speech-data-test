 Mainly drama.  Mr. Dragon has made a great struggle to teach the Greek people.  What happened in the wiretapping scandal and we saw very well the contempt and targeting of those who were beaten by the polack in the past.  Now Mr Georgiades was beating them.  So that is why I call on you in this next great struggle of the national elections, to raise high the flag of the democratic party.  Algiers of national dignity GAL.  Facing toxicity and division.
