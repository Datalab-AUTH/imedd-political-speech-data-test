 The truth no matter how much you hide it.  At some point, the issue is brought up not to be brought up at the expense of the public interest at too slow a pace.  So, we have a clear view on geopolitical issues.  All these issues must be dealt with in absolute solidarity and not with brutal divisions, especially during the elections, so that the Greek people see other problems, but not the solution of the real problems that a country in a critical geopolitical region has to face.  Friends and friends.
