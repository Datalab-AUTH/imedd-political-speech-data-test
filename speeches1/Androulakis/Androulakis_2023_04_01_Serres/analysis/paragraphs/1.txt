Friends and friends.  And today, here in Serres, the message is loud and clear - Andreas Papandreou's PASOK is back.  The country's algae, not as a complement, as Mr. Tsipras, Mr. Mitsotakis wants, but as a protagonist for a new hope for a new change.  So make our power a decision of change for all Greek women and men.  What the Greek people expect from us.  After years of adventures.  The fiscal crisis, the pandemic of Targeting.  Where it all started.  Mainly in the economy with the bankruptcy that Mr. Karamanlis handed over to George Papandreou.
