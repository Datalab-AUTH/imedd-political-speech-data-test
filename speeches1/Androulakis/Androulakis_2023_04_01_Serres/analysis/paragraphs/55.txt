 Greece was not dependent on natural gas to the extent that it is today.  So, then, a government that strategically saw the future of the Greek people and the geopolitical security of the country.  What should it have done to invest in the networks so that we can consume the energy we produce, whatever happens in Turkey with its pipelines to Russia or other countries, but they went in favor of serving the domestic oligarchy and gave the whole energy mix to go to natural gas for the few to exploit the many today with the energy crisis and even.  And in fact, instead of those few paying.  We paid for the energy crisis with our taxes, all of us, by giving billions in subsidies.  The rest of the oligarchy in Europe were losing and in Greece they were winning at the expense of the Greek people under the seal of Mr.Tsipras and Mr.Mitsotakis Gal.  So Gal, friends.
