 The state through the s says No, sir, you do your job and we do ours.  When Mr. Priest picks up the phone.  And he says that set up the tenders for the licences to distribute the shares to the oligarchs who support SYRIZA.  The state says you do your job and we do ours.  If we do not have this clean state that respects the institutions, the justice system and the citizens, you can be sure that we will have new fiscal adventures ahead of us, because no one will respect your space.  Your rights, your children and your grandchildren.  So this is PASOK's duty to build a transparent, meritocratic state that will not be a state of impunity for the oligarchs.
