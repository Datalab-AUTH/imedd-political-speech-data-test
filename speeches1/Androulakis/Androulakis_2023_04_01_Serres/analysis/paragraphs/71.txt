We finally owe it to.  Gal to declare the sectoral agreements that have been signed as compulsory, the first being that of hotel workers and of course this time to be the last time that the minimum wage is determined by state intervention.  We are determined to bring back the setting of the minimum wage to the social partners themselves through the national general collective agreement, because the worker must at last.  To feel, respect that there are rights.  There is a prospect that his efforts are paying off.  Gal all of them.
