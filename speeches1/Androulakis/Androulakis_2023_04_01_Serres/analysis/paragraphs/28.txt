 The gentlemen of the new democracy, Mr Mitsotakis that a project of their own.  I want to remind the Greek people of something that the channels have not been saying for the last few days PASOK started this project and the New Democracy voted against it when it started.  Mr Tsipras is against this project, but four and a half years as prime minister he did not touch it, if he was so ideologically against it he should have torn down the Evros fence.  So let's say, we actually.  Obviously for us there are borders.  Both at sea and on the Evros.
