 Impunity.  So respecting justice and institutions.  So when independent authorities are attacked, we respond with PASOK strong, we will have a strong rule of law, separation of powers and strong independent authorities.  Because for us the goal is for the Greek people to finally live in a European normality, for the state to respect its citizens and for us all to feel that we are equal before the law and not that for a few people we are equal before the law.  The cronies of Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis have a regime of impunity, a regime of a peculiar attempt to cover up all their actions.  This is our difference in political ethos.  That is why we are a democratic party, because we really want there to be absolute transparency and meritocracy.
