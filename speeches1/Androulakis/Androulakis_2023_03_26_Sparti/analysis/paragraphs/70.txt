 The attacks of the far-right skeletons of the new democracy are an honour for every democrat, just as the attacks of Kammenos, the far-right associate of Mr Tsipras, were an honour.  This is the history of the democratic party.  We will therefore prevent the Greek people from seeing again at the helm of the government those extreme right-wing skeletons who think that PASOK will become a tool in their power games.  PASOK has returned as a protagonist, the PASOK of Andreas Papandreou, the PASOK of the people's struggles, the PASOK of democracy, national dignity and social justice in the next national elections, together with all of you, will be on the winners' shore and on election night will propose the path of the great changes that the strong country of the future needs.  So in closing, I ask you a joy from the bottom of my heart.  Take the effort of the democratic party in your hands in the coming weeks.  I stand with each and every one of you and not with those who want a political system held hostage, a domestic oligarchy and not this proud historical faction of the new change.  Bless you and have a good race.
