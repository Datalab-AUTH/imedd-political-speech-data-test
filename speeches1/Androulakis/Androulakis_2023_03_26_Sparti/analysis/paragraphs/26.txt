 A strong bell has been rung in Europe, we cannot have the management of 2009 and 2010.  Where we had Lehman Brothers and then they told us to get along on your own.  They understand that the European peoples and not only the Greek people.  They are on the verge of undermining Europe's national production.  That we are now dependent on China and other countries, we have to make progress, some steps have been taken, I am not saying that they are the best possible, that's why we are fighting as a European Social Democratic Party to have financial solidarity tools permanently throughout Europe and that's why in 2 sessions of the European Socialist Party, I keep saying that the future is a European Economic Fund of European economic sovereignty.  So that we are not vulnerable to global turbulence.
