 2%.  What Greece 2%.  Greece that does not have a primary health care system as extensive as they have Greece that its hospitals have become primary health care centers to deal with covid, resulting in the braking of preventive medicine Greece that its doctors leave to Germany because the salaries they pay on the island are starvation wages and they do not respect the struggle to study for so many years Greece that has no health personnel Greece that asks for a new NHS, a new national health care system.  So I guarantee that if we have a strong mandate, as George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos did, we will build the national health system of 2023, of the future, and not be third in health costs across Europe.
