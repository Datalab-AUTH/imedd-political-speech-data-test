 The tourist schools that we did all over Greece.  The day before yesterday I was in Agios Nikolaos the school is the same in Rhodes and I met 100 students.  People, ambitious young people who went to Agios Nikolaos even though they know the cost of living.  Why they want to work.  They believe in Greek tourism, they want to become employees, they envision their hope and ambition to become employees in Greek tourism.
