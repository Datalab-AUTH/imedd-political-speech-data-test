 To give billions for the army advances, not to those who needed them but to those who made them in real estate and bank deposits.  are the taxes of all of us.  These are the taxes of all of us, this money, the money that told the Greek budget.  In terms of taxation, we say we are reducing the rates on salaried work because we have a priority of many good jobs, but a government cannot come to a bankrupt Greece and say no, we have another priority.  Up to 4.8 million and 800. 000 â‚¬ to transfer property and wealth from parents and grandparents to grandchildren without tax.  Is it possible in a country that has gone through such a bankruptcy that this is the priority instead of reducing rates on wage labour?  Another point.
