 Friends and friends.  These examples need another culture.  And I aspire that 2023 will be the year of great change.  That we will be the pioneers of this new culture.  Where there will be a concept of man where society will be at the forefront, man's labour rights, man's human rights, the reduction of inequalities, the opportunities for the new generation, the infrastructure for a strong Greece of the future.  Not a country that will constantly decline, without knowing what its future is.
