 What I said from the first moment of my election I say to this day.  And for partnerships.  And about the big changes that need to be made.  And on how to build a new relationship of trust between the political system and the ordinary citizen and especially the new generation.  Who turns her back on politics, just the same.  But what has changed in recent days.  And the same words.  The same vision made the domestic interconnection to be in vertigo.  The domestic complex is in vertigo.
