 And instead of being a thing of the past from the political system, they have him as the first showcase in their ballots.  Who respected the Constitution.  In their attacks on the independent authorities.  The current government, which says it came to confront the viciousness of the SYRIZA-Independent Greeks government, respected the Constitution.  On the issue of the wiretapping that exposed the country worldwide, to monitor the leader of the third party, the heads of the armed forces.  Their ministers.  Where have these things been heard before, but that is what PASOK and Andreas Papandreou fought for, for democracy, for national pride, for respect for human rights, for the rule of law.  This is what all the leaderships of the democratic party fought for.  And what the domestic oligarchy asks of us to show tolerance to all these phenomena of decadence.  And to take the mandate that the Constitution gives me the right to have in my hands and to propose as Prime Minister one of the protagonists of the debasement.
