 If we have a strong energy network within Greece.  The energy transition, the green transition.  Strengthening renewable energy sources.  It will not be a game of 5 oligarchs with big parks but of hundreds of farmers, ranchers, farmers, processors, small traders all over Greece and especially in Southern Greece where we have this climate.  Why we will have a highly interconnected network.  And they will all go to our cooperatives instead of going bankrupt to build these parks regional municipalities to have free energy for the homes in the region.  Why poorer Athenians and Thessalonians will be able to put photovoltaic panels on their roofs.  What we are saying is from another planet, not what Portugal, Spain, Germany and countries that want a just energy transition and addressing the energy poverty of the future are doing.  And not a country.  The oligarchs are pampering their government because whatever Europe gives them comes first and not all of you.
