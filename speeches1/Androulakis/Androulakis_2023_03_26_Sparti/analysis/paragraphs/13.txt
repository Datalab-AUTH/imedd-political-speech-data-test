 Mitsotakis when there is a disaster.  Mr Mitsotakis, he doesn't know anything, so he doesn't know Mr Patsis, but it just so happens that Mr Patsis' son was in charge of the management of red loans in the new democracy.  Mr Mitsotakis knew nothing about the wiretaps.  But by coincidence he was the one responsible for taking the NSA to the Maximos building.  He put his nephew essentially in control of the activities of the NSA and the chosen one of the NSA commander, changing the law that existed.  He didn't know anything.
