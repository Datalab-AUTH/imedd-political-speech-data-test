 Friends and friends I say all this.  Because there's a battle going on here.  Which is clean now.  on the one hand is the word of progress, the truth of common sense.  The dignity of the public interest.  And on the other hand 2 power systems that are capable of doing anything and saying anything just for the chair.  So that's it, then, with Mr Tsipras' system of power and Mr Mitsotakis' system of power, who have the audacity to say justice everywhere, but they mean justice for us and for them.  Only a cover-up at last.
