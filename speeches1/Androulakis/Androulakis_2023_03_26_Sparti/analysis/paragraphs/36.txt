 Our proposal is to respect the Constitution, to take the mandate, to propose programmatic solutions based on our priorities and if we don't have the power to do this and then of course there is no prime minister unknown x.  But if we were to name a candidate for prime minister, then we would be flouting the popular verdict.  Therefore, just as the government programme is a programme of programmatic convergences, so too the persons in critical ministries and in the Prime Minister's office must express this programme and not be disdained by the oligarchy's domestics, the popular verdict of the next national elections, they cannot therefore call respect for the Constitution arrogance, while they know very well that all they care about is that there is a person in the leadership of the country who will serve them like Mr Mitsotakis.  In the coming years we have other priorities for this.  I am ready to clash fiercely with this establishment that despises the public interest and is the main responsible element.  Who led Greece into bankruptcy no matter how much they want us to forget their responsibilities.  So we continue.  Our programmatic discussion is just the networks, not of course.
