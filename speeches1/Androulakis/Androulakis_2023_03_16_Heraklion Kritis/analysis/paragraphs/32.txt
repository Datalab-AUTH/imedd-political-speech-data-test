 So why don't we make another policy.  And what is this policy.  It is the policy that puts a stop to the grafting of the Greek economy.  And I start with the red loans, which.  There are many people here who have been very involved and Mr. Spyrakos is the executive.  The Secretary General who wrote with his little hands the Katseli Law, Spyrakos is the man who prevented thousands of Greeks from getting their first home in previous years, when today New Democracy says that I can't do anything and the Supreme Court makes such decisions, they should think that we and Mr Spyrakos negotiated with the worst troika in the most difficult time.
