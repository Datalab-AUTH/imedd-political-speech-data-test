 Recovery Fund last point, but very important because it concerns manufacturing, farmers, stockbreeders and every Greek who is at risk of energy poverty.  What is the last point.  In Crete there is now a cable that connects us with the rest of Greece, because it is these cables.  These cables were made to make a fair green transition.  Green transition means moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.  Fair what the so-called democratisation of production means.  Some people are put off by the expression, but this is the reality.  So what does fair and democratisation of production mean?  It means that this cable.  It will not be exploited as a priority by the 5 big players who are exploiting the renewable energy sources, but by the people of Crete with photovoltaics on the roofs with energy communities, such as now Kalochori with energy communities for farmers and herders.  This should be a priority in terms of connectivity.
