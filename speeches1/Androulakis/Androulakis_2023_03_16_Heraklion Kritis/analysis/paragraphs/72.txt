 This is our agony and this will be the banner of the victorious struggle we will fight in the next national elections.  Therefore, all together for the new change, for the great victory, we wish you well and good strength in this new effort, the effort of dignity and perspective for all Greek women and all Greeks.  Be well.  Thank you very much.  For your moving presence, be well.
