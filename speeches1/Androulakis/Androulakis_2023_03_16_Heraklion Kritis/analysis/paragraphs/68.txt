 Did Mr Mitsotakis show the same sensitivity for his nephew, the protagonist of the wiretapping, who did everything he could to protect him and the companies involved?  No, of course not.  He did the same Mr Tsipras with his best friend when the Special Court convicted him with 13 zeros for the tender and the trading of TV licences with powerful interests behind the scenes, he barely put him on the ballot paper and even when the same judges acquitted Touloupaki they issued a statement of great joy.  And success, when the judges themselves condemned Papaggelopoulos, they condemned the judges.  This is not justice for all.  It is justice for us, but not for Tsipras and his company and Mitsotakis and his company.  We have a different ethos, we have different principles, different values and you can be sure that even if it comes up it will have the same fate as what happened last week.  One little misdemeanour, one little misdemeanour.
