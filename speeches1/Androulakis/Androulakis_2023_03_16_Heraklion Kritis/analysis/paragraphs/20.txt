 One said it would change Greece and bring strong institutions and the other said it would bring social justice.  You are experiencing the results today in your own skin.  Greece is experiencing huge inequalities.  Missed opportunities with European Recovery Fund funds.  For the first time it is being targeted by the European Union for democracy issues, as it was for economic issues in previous years.  The Greek people deserve this future.  We have to fight to show that there is another way, a way of dignity.  I'm not going to instrumentalize either anger or indignation.
