 I build new houses, I record the closed houses in Thessaloniki alone are 15. 000.  I give tax incentives for their owners to open them.  Zero ENVIA low tax I give the European program the money to reconstruct these houses with a commitment for 10-15 years, these houses to be put in a social pool and only rented to young couples.  Or to Greeks with social criteria, low with a low amount.  Why?  Why is there competition when you have to rent.  100-150. 000 houses with social criteria with 300 and 400 â‚¬ you force the other houses in the urban centres to lower the cost and so they do not only gain 150. 000 families, but gains half a million citizens, as similar surveys show.
