 That in a few years we will be looking for spare parts and we will not find them to satisfy these protection systems and why they do not go to number 2 directly that these gentlemen of the new democracy and SYRIZA must return the 55 million euros that the project costs to the European Commission.  This is the Greece that the Greeks do not deserve.  It is the Greece of low expectations that protects powerful economic interests that does not want to put order in the public sector that is state-demanding, but at the same time when it privatizes, it does so only in terms of speculation of the powerful and not in terms of the public interest.  So the issue is not the state private sector.  The point is that nothing works if there are no rules and transparency criteria, because these policies want to.
