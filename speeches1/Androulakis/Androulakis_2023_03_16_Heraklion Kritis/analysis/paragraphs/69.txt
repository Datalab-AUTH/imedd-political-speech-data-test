 Which our political opponents have exploited with audacity to turn the eyes of the Greek people away from the real responsibilities of the tragedy.  We dealt with it with directness.  I say this because we will build step by step credibility and a relationship of trust with the Greek people, because credibility is very difficult to win.  But if you are not firm in your principles, it is also too easily lost and because we have all been hurt.  From such phenomena I pledge to you that there is no way there will be zero zero zero tolerance to phenomena that hurt the Greek people and especially the confidence of the younger generations.
