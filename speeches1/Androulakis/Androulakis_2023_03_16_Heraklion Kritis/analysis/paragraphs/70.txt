 Friends and friends.  So I invite you to fight this fight together.  Take the party in your hands.  We have the arguments, we have the history, we have the offer, we have put our heads together, we are not unrepentant like our political opponents and we ask again for a strong mandate for change from the Greek people.  We have a duty to embrace all generations with honesty and sincerity, to give perspective to the young, to give hope to the working people, to give confidence to the creative productive forces of the country.  We have a duty to protect the underprivileged of our time, the vulnerable Greeks.
