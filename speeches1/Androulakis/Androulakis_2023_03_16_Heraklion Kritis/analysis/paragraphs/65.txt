 again PASOK and the democratic party is rooted in the heart and soul of the people of Crete and it is our duty to fight in the coming weeks, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, village by village, new and old members, to make PASOK again the leading force in Heraklion, in the Castle of Democracy, the Castle of the Struggles for social justice and national dignity.  We have a duty to speak the word of truth.  We have a duty to show a new political ethos.  What children are looking for in the squares all over the country.
