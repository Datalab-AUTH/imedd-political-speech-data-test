 So the dilemma of the coming national elections is not Tsipras or Mitsotakis.  It is not a new democracy or SYRIZA.  The real dilemma is either a state that is a prey to the rulers of the day to exploit it with the sole aim of the client state and the strengthening of their power.  Or a state that will guarantee the public interest and give a perspective to all Greek women and men.  On this second bank the democratic party stands proudly.
