 It was the result of specific planning which, despite the very great difficulties, our country implemented.  And of course we cannot forget that all of this was done in the midst of extremely difficult geopolitical conditions.  I pledged in 2019 that our country would regain its lost prestige in Europe and in the south-eastern Mediterranean and we have fully achieved that.  I told you in 2019 that it is the duty of every favoured nation to protect its borders.  And today the borders of our country are safe.  And the day after tomorrow I will be in Evros to sign the extension of the fence that protects our land border.  I was committed to investing more in our Armed Forces, after ten years of crisis.  And a few days ago, in the parade that took place for our national holiday, the French Rafale that we got in record time with an interstate agreement flew in the Attica skies.  And the upgraded F-16 Viper which are now being built and upgraded at the Naval Air Force.
