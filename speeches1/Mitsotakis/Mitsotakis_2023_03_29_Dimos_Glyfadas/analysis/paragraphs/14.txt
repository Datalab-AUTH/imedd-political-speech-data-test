 And it was our government that made a drastic intervention in the EFKA so that we could finally deal with this tragedy, this shame of pending pensions, that you have to wait two and three years to get your pension.  And we achieved our mission and today the pensions are coming out in two months.  So we have shown that we have the ability to confront and to be able to defend our ideas and to fight for a better, more meritocratic, more transparent, more effective state and this will be a central objective of the second four-year term.  Just as the central objective of the second four-year term, friends, will be the economic growth that we have set out to achieve.  Not only to continue, but to ensure that its benefits are spread throughout Greek society.  As I committed in 2019 that the main objective of our economic policy for the next four years will be less taxes, so I look you in the eye and tell you now that my commitment for the second four years will be better wages for all Greeks.  And we know how we can implement this policy, we know how to bring in foreign investment, we know that ultimately the credibility of our country as a serious investment destination is what will make the difference.  Today, in the midst of these very difficult circumstances, the Hellenic Republic, one day after the announcement of the elections, went out and borrowed with a borrowing spread of one fourth of what the Hellenic Republic had in 2019 under SYRIZA.  Why this happens.
