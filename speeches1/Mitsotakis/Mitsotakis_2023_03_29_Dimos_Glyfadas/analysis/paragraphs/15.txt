 Because there is credibility.  And I pledge that if the Greek people trust us and the next day we have a strong and stable government, our country will finally regain investment grade status within 2023.  This is important for all, because the investment grade ultimately means lower borrowing costs for the Hellenic Republic, but also lower borrowing costs for banks, for households and for businesses.  Our third major commitment for the next four years, my friends, concerns public health and the National Health System.  I want once again to say a big thank you to all the employees of the National Health System who kept not only the NHS but also the country standing during the difficult days of the pandemic.  We know that we need to build even more on the National Health System.  Strengthen it, modernise our hospitals more, invest more in the Personal Doctor, invest even more in prevention and screening.  And the reform of the National Health System will be a central commitment and a personal political priority for the next day, for the next four years.  We have the resources secured from the Recovery Fund, we have the will and the will and the knowledge on how we can make it happen.
