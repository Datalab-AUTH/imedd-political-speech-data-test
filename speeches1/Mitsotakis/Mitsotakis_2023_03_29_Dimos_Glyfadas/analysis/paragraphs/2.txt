 I was touched that you remembered that, indeed, my parents were married here in the church of Constantine and Helen in 1953 and our relations with Glyfada are historic and I am glad that under your leadership and the leadership of your team and with a close cooperation with the Government, Glyfada is flourishing, progressing, for the benefit of all its citizens and its many visitors, it is truly becoming a model city.  You are right, my friend Mayor, that indeed in this four-year period we have been called upon to deal with too many turbulences.  When you trusted us in July 2019, no one expected that our government would be called upon to deal with more crises than any other government in the post-war era.  But we kept the steering wheel steady and Greece today is stronger, it's a country that exudes more confidence and more prestige abroad than in 2019.
