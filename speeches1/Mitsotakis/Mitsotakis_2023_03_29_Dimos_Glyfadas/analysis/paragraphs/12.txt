 And yet we did it.  But there were other battles we fought and did not win, friends.  That is why I want to give you, here in Glyfada, a commitment: today I am more determined than ever to confront all the foci of anachronism and anachronism in the Greek public administration.  This will be one of our central commitments for the next four years.  And to those who doubt that we have the will and the ability to do so, I want to remind them of a simple reality: it was New Democracy that has always historically clashed with those pockets of regression in the public sector and dared to take on the bad guilds and the bad trade unionists, because there are good trade unionists but there are also bad trade unionists.  We were the ones who dared to consolidate the Olympic.  We were the ones who intervened in OTE.  The young people who are with us today see OTE, a modern company, taken over by a German giant, but they don't remember what OTE was in our time.
