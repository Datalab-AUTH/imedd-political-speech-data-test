 And as we begin the great battle for the elections of May 21, I believe that it is our obligation, the obligation of all the members of New Democracy and all the friends of New Democracy who united in 2019 with a great demand: to honour the truth agreement we signed.  Let us recall what we have managed to achieve in these four years in very difficult circumstances.  Because I want you to remember that despite the fact that a large part of our time was spent managing crises - to recall them briefly: a threat of a migrant invasion, a neighbour that kept causing problems in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, a pandemic, a war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, many natural disasters - despite the fact that we faced all these crises, we were consistent with all the central commitments that we made in July 2019.  And let anyone from the opposition dare to question this.
