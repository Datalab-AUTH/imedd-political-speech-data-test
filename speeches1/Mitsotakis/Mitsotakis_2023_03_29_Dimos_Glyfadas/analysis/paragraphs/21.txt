 So, I want, once again, here from Glyfada, to thank you.  To thank you for your long-standing support for our party.  To say to the young citizens who will possibly come to vote for us for the first time, that they must see and compare strictly.  And I do believe that there are indeed citizens who at the last moment, in 2019, did not trust us.  And this time they will take the step of trusting us, because now we are not talking about promises but about results.  We are credible in the commitments we give you for the second four years, precisely because what we told you in 2019 we have put into practice.
