"Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayors, thank you very much.  Friends, neo-democrats, what an amazing reception here in my city of Glyfada.  I hope that we will come close to the percentages of the "captain" of Glyfada in the next elections.  And on May 21, the 21st of Saints Constantine and Helen, Glyfada is celebrating, but the whole of Greece will celebrate our great victory, the victory of our New Democracy party.  And yes, my dear Mayor, you are right.  When we start a great battle we want to come primarily to places that are particularly familiar to us.
