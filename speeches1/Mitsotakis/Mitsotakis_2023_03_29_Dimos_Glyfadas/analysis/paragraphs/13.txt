 We and the government of Kostas Karamanlis were the ones who took the first steps to privatize the PPA, when those who claim the mantle of "progressive", their leaders at the time were at the PPA's bars, you remember, protesting against privatization.  Our government was the one that, apart from the gov. gr consolidate the PPC.  We took over a bankrupt company and today we have made it a leader in Greece and the Balkans.  And if the PPC were not so strong, it would not be easy to provide support to businesses and households for their electricity bills.
