 And we also want to convince the citizens of the need, the urgent need in these difficult circumstances, the next day to have a stable and strong government.  And only New Democracy can ensure this stability today.  I hear a lot of talk about first ballot, second ballot.  One is the election, May 21st we vote for the Greece we deserve.  And this is the ballot box that will ultimately send a strong message about who will rule this country, which Government and which Prime Ministerial candidate will be elected.  From there, others have to explain how they perceive the "progressive" governance they imagine can emerge on May 22nd.  They will get the answer at the polls.  But those who claim that it may occur on 22 May should explain who they will work with.
