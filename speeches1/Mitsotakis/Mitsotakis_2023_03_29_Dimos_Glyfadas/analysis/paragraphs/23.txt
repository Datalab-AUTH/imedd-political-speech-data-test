 And you know, a mistake only becomes a mistake when it is repeated.  I didn't promise in 2019 that we can do miracles.  But I promised you a lot of hard work and measurable results.  And with a clear conscience that we have worked very hard, that we have kept the country safe in difficult circumstances, we put our work to the judgment of the Greek people.  And I am sure that the Greek people will judge responsibly, seriously.  He will compare and when the critical moment comes for him to take responsibility - because at some point we will say what we have to say and eventually the responsibility will pass to all of you, to the Greek people - I am sure that he will again trust the only force that can guarantee both stability and progress in our country today: our great party, New Democracy.  So I would like to ask you, in these almost 56-57 days - that's how many days we have left before the elections - to fight this beautiful battle together.
