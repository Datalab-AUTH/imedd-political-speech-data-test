 Friends, we will have the opportunity in this election period to talk about many things.  We will take stock.  As I said, we will do it with honesty, with sincerity, recognising the great progress of our country, but with courage we will also face our weaknesses.  You know, my friends, I never hid.  I never hid and always had the courage to take the responsibility that was mine.
