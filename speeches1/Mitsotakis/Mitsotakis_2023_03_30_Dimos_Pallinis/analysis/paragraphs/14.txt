 If you don't have growth you can't support society.  If you don't have the ability to produce national wealth, how would you support society.  For example, during the pandemic, I don't think there's a business here in Gerakas, in East Attica, that doesn't recognize or support us and doesn't support us that this government quickly and effectively supported all small and medium-sized businesses in the heart of the pandemic and in doing so we protected jobs and allowed the economy to grow again.  And we did the same during the Greek crisis.  All of you get electricity bills and you remember the very great concern, which was there a year ago we were told.  Citizens are seeing their electricity bills rise a lot and we intervened and you know the intervention we intervened we taxed the excess profits of the electricity producers and allowed the citizens.  And not this one.  Will.
