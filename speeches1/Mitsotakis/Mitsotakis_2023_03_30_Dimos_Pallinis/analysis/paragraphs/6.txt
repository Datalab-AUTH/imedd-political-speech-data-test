 Let me take this opportunity to remind you what those who supported this effort are and who are still standing against it today.  In the difficult effort that our country is making to secure its borders.  Just yesterday a SYRIZA MEP supported an amendment.  Watch, listen to this one asking the European Commission not to fund the Evros fence.  To listen all is to listen, listen, no need for disapproval, It just needs just need just need judgment and right choice for the next day.
