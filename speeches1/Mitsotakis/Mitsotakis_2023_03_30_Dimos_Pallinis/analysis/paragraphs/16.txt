 Our agricultural products are at a record high right now, record exports of our agricultural products and our economy as a whole is in such good shape that it has allowed the Greek Republic to be able to be able to go out and borrow in the markets the day after the national elections were called at an interest rate significantly lower than the difference in the spread rate than what the previous governments were borrowing at.  And all this.  These are successes of the government, but friends, I want to be honest with you, we didn't do everything.  Here I think it is very important that we stand self-critically and with a willingness to improve in the face of our failures, masks, our mistakes and I am the last person to tell you that we took a Greece that was in a tragic situation and turned it into a paradise.  No, there are still major weaknesses and things that need to be corrected, as I was coming over here to talk to you, a fellow citizen caught you and said something to me that I hear all the time.  Kyriakos change everything and I have to tell you.
