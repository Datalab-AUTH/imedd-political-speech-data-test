 So we can take stock, but mainly we will talk about the future.  To unfold our programme for the Greece we envision for the major interventions we want to make at all levels, in the state, in the economy, in education, in health, where we still have a lot of work to do.  The national health system stood up during the pandemic, but it also highlighted chronic pathologies and we will be bold and we will intervene in health and I want you to know that the new national health system will be a personal bet of mine in the next four years.
