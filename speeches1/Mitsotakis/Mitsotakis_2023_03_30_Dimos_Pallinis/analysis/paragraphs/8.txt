 The Evros fence will be finished.  The migration crisis was just one of the many adventures we have had to face in these 4 years.  We have had an aggressive neighbour, a pandemic that tested the national health system, a major energy crisis as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a series of natural disasters.  I believe that all these crises have been managed with competence and efficiency.  We kept, we kept the ship of our homeland safe and Greece.  From Greece.
