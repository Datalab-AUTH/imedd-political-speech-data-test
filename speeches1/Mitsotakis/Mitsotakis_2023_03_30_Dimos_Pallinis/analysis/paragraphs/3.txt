 I wanted to be with you today, I am on my way to New Makri where I will soon have the opportunity to inaugurate the new fire brigade training centre.  This.  The visit brings back memories of a very difficult evening, which we had to manage.  You remember it well in the difficult fire where we had to intervene and I think we have demonstrated here in your region the great progress we have made in civil protection issues.  The best coordination, dear Mr. District Governor, between the fire department of the municipalities.
