 So I could stand in front of you today, friends, and say Look, my fellow citizens, I have been very busy managing a series of crises and unfortunately I have not been able to implement our electoral programme.  I don't do it because it's simply not true, despite the great crises we've faced.  We have been consistent in all.  Our election campaign.  East Attica pre-election and I had talked to you now I remind you why we will be committed and we go to see together and judge whether what I had told you we do practice.  My first commitment, and my most important commitment, was that we would revive the economy and reduce taxes and contributions and we reduced taxes and contributions.
