 The President before me to remind you, without joking, without exaggerating, without exaggerating, without complacency, what we have achieved in these 4 years.  To also remind citizens of what we have achieved, we have not achieved in normal times in normal times.  We have achieved this at a time when our government has been called upon to manage more crises than any other government in the post-war period.  Tomorrow tomorrow I will be in Evros and I will have the opportunity.  Extension of the Evros dam project.  I want.
