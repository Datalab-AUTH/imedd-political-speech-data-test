I want you to think a little bit about what is happening in a number of European countries that have a simple proportional representation electoral system.  I don't know how many of you know that neighbouring Bulgaria has a simple proportional representation.  Neighbouring Bulgaria will therefore go to the polls on 2 April.  For those of you who don't know, this is the fifth, I repeat, the fifth election in two years.
