And of course, of course, the armouring of national defence will continue, with the major armament programmes which are already underway. We are therefore heading to the polls armed with clear objectives, but also with mature lessons.  Without forgetting the obstacles we have overcome, the leaps we have made, but I will say it again, without hiding behind our failures. And I know that today, just as there are citizens who I believe will vote for us for the first time, who didn't trust us in 2019 but who are now convinced by our work that they deserve to trust us now, there are some who trusted us in 2019 and now may be skeptical.  I answer them: We may have hurt you, but we certainly never betrayed you.  And I assure you that when we stumble we will not fall.
