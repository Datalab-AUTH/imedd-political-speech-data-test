 We are living in very difficult times and it is not foreseen that the international environment will become easier. We have a war in Ukraine which is going on, an energy crisis which seems to be under control but we don't know what is going to happen in 6 to 12 months.  We have the waves of international inflation, we have increases in the interest rates of the European Central Bank. We have a global, watch out, banking turmoil.  I open brackets: with Greek banks and Greek deposits completely shielded and safe.  Because this is also a success of this government.  Consider where our banks were in 2015.
