It is an important intervention that sends a message that we are listening to the young generation and that we are focusing our attention especially on those of our fellow citizens who have been perhaps more affected than anyone else during this decade-long crisis.  Since they remember themselves, they basically see a Greece that is constantly facing problems. We will have the opportunity to discuss all this in great detail during the election period.  Because, of course, at the same time, all the major options that have been launched since '19 will be evolving: the reduction of taxes, to be combined with increases, to improve disposable income. And of course the development of the national economy and the conquest at last of the investment grade of our country.  This will happen - if the Greek people trust us - before the end of 2023.  And this is of particular importance, because in an environment of increased interest rates it is very important to have the investment grade, so that we can compress the cost of borrowing for the Hellenic Republic and the banks, but ultimately for businesses and households as well.
