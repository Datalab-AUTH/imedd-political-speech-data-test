 They've had it and they've learned, there will be no second time in disaster. And SYRIZA may have left behind the "mine" of the simple proportional representation, in order to serve exactly this: chaos and political instability, but the Greeks have both memory and knowledge, they know very well where they want to go, but they do not forget, we do not forget where we started from. Thus they will cancel both the "bomb" of ungovernability and a new political anomaly.  And that is why I say that in the first and decisive ballot, the voters will decide who will govern the country.  And when I say "who" I mean which party and which Prime Minister. While the second will decide how this Prime Minister will govern.
