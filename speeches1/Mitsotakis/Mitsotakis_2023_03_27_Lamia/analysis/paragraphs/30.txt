So, the clouds of circumstance, my friends, even if they temporarily shade the horizon, cannot hide the difference between Greece of 2019 and Greece of 2023. In 2019, the country was the laggard in growth in Europe, but was a champion in wage and pension cuts.  It now has one of the most dynamic economies in Europe.  Reduced unemployment by 7 percentage points.  We have the fastest deceleration of public debt as a percentage of GDP in all of Europe.  We have increased, despite imported precision, the disposable income of its citizens. And of course Moria's Greece, the one that once did not distinguish maritime borders, today saves lives in the Aegean and extends the fence on Evros.  Leaving the sidelines.
