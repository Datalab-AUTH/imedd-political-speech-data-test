 I personally took this decision together with the economic staff, because I am the first to recognise, friends, that wages in our country are still low and because I think how difficult it is for a young child on the minimum wage to make ends meet with the 713 euros he was getting before the increase. Will raising the minimum wage solve all problems.  No.
