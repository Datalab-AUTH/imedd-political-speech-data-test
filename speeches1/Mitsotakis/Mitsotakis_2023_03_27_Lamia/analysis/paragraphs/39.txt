 It makes detailed reference, as I said, to the major comparative advantages of your Region.  How the Region can become a leader in the secondary sector, in manufacturing, in the tertiary sector, in tourism.  Important investments that I had the opportunity to visit today with the Regional Governor and the Mayor, the Lamia Exhibition, projects financed by the Recovery Fund, important interventions in health, education, culture. In other words, a coherent roadmap for the dynamic Region of 2030, for Central Greece, which I ask you to give us the strength to make a reality together. Because I know very well that it is not only important to talk about the big things and the national things, but we must also talk about the things that concern the citizens, about the regional problems, about your local problems, about the support of the municipalities.  The Mayors who are with us know that no government has ever made more financial tools available to them than the New Democracy government.  And many projects that are being implemented across Greece are funded by the Antonis Tritsis programme.
