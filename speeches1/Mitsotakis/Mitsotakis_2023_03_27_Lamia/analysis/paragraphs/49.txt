 I'll put it as simply as possible: You vote for New Democracy to have Mitsotakis as Prime Minister.  Let's say you vote for SYRIZA to have Tsipras as Prime Minister.  But why vote for something you don't know what it will be tomorrow. That is, such positions do not correspond to the criticality of the moments.
