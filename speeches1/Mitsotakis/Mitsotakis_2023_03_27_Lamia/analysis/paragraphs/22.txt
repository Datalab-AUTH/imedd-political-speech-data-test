During the pandemic we supported businesses across the country and saved hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Here, in Central Greece alone, small and medium-sized enterprises received more than 230 million euros from the circles of refundable and non-refundable advance payment. We supported our farmers, more than 400 million received by producers.  More than 150 million only here in Central Greece received the most vulnerable citizens.  While we have secured and are giving almost half a billion to regenerate Evia after the devastating fires that hit it. At the same time, the state continues to erect many barriers to imported precision.  The Household Basket and the Market Pass provide a significant relief to everyday life and I am optimistic, cautiously optimistic that the worst of inflation is now behind us.  We are already among the lowest in Europe.
