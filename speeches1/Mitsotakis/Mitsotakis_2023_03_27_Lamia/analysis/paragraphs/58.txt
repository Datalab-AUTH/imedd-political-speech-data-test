 They say to me: 'Don't become a politician of the series.  Make a difference". These are words that - you know - hurt, but they are also words that at the same time lead me.  And I will serve this difference until it becomes the norm in everyday life.  It is an everyday life where much has changed, but more remains to be changed before we are hurt again. And this is the moral basis, the value system of my political philosophy.  I never hesitate to apologize when I feel heavy with the facts.  But I always have to frame the self-criticism with the perspective, only in this way I believe that the country will become better.  With her, we will become better too.
