So I will not follow those who pour party poison on a national trauma.  I stick to the obvious truth that everyone has now realized. Telecommanding of trains - which should have been ready by 2016 - was never done by the government of the day.  While we may have accelerated it, installed a local control in Larissa, but we failed to complete the project nationwide on time.
