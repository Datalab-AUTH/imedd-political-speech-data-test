 You will find a very well thought out plan with secured funding resources. A plan that was developed in consultation with the local community, with projects that you proposed to us.  A plan that covers all the main policy pillars, that addresses chronic infrastructure pathologies, that emphasizes the primary sector, that emphasizes the comparative advantages of your Region and that, if implemented, can truly make Central Greece a champion in growth and social well-being.  Covering indicatively large gaps that existed in the infrastructure. A parenthesis to open, I had committed in 2019 that I do not want any Region of our country, any Regional Unit to be cut off from the central fabric.  That is why we are promoting a number of important road projects.  The Bralos-Amfissa is one of them, which we unstuck. The Chalkida bypass which was recently contracted.
