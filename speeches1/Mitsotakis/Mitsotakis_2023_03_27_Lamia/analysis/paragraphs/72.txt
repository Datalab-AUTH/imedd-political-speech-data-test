And it is a great effort in which I invite you first - because today I am addressing the heart of the party - to become protagonists, explaining our positions with facts and arguments to each of our fellow citizens, answering with conviction to their questions, to their objections, with determination, but please without conceit.  And always looking to the future. So that the slogan "We are staying in Europe", which we once achieved, is now transformed into "We have become Europe" at all levels, with Greece and the Greeks in front. And I know I am, we are ambitious in what we claim.  But we have shown that we can conquer them.  And so it will be now.  And from tomorrow the struggle for the great victory of our country and our society for a second strong mandate for progress begins.  And on this exciting new journey I want you all by my side. Let's go, let's move forward without compromise, united, under the flag of Greece 2030.  For Lamia, for Central Greece as a protagonist, for the strong and modern homeland that we want and will have.
