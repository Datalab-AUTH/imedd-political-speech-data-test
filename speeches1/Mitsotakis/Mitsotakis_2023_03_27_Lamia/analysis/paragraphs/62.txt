 It was our government that took on what we call the deep state. And when we have had to make bold interventions in the EFKA, we have not hesitated to do so.  And we were criticised at the time, but these interventions have allowed us today to look pensioners in the eye and say to them: "Yes, we are doing in Greece what is happening in every modern European country: you can get your pension in two months, not two years.".
