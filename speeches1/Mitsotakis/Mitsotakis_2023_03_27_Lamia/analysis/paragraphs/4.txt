Because we now know that in Tempe, where you also mourned your own compatriots, human errors met with the shortcomings of a problematic organisation.  With long-standing problems, which unfortunately we have not been able to fully address before the evil caught up with us. That's why I took responsibility in the name of all those who ruled the country, because the drama happened with us at the helm.  Personally I never hid, nor will I say "it's everyone else's fault but ours".  We, therefore, have the first duty to set the conditions so that such an evil never, ever happens again. I promised this to the mother of Spyros, the engine driver from Lianokladi, who lost her only son.  I would say the same to the parents of Elpida, of Giannis, of all the young children who were so unjustly lost. And this promise I consider my sacred duty.  No one hurts more today than the families of the victims.  But no Greek is in more or less pain than the other.
