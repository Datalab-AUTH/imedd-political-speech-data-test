   I don't know if you noticed, SYRIZA started its campaign with the slogan "Justice everywhere".  After the conviction of Mr.  Pappa was quickly withdrawn, because justice was indeed done in this case and his closest associate Mr.  Tsipras was convicted 13-0, mind you, by the Supreme Court, of the most dishonorable offense for a public figure, which is none other than misconduct in office.
