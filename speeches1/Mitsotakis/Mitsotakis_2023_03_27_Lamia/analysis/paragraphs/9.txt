Just the other day Mr.  Spirtzis spoke for almost two hours in the Parliament, without finding an apology for the disastrous events that took place during his days.  And its leader, with various lies, told us roughly that everything was working perfectly on the Greek railways until July 2019. We will see this play many times heading into the elections.  Only it will fail miserably, since truth rejects oblivion before anything else.
