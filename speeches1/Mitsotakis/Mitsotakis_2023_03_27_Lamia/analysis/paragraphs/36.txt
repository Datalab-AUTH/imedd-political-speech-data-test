 And just as the country of 2023 has nothing to do with the Greece of 2019, the Greece of 2027 will be much, much better than today's Greece. And in this way the big bet of the next elections arises: do we go forward or do we go back?  Will we confront the bad past even more bravely, even more boldly, or will we finally come to terms with it? And we will decide together, united, to overcome mistakes and obstacles or we will be defeated by making the wrong choices.  Will we consolidate all that we have achieved or will we roll back, doomed like Sisyphus to push the rock of the country back up the hill of progress? In other words, we will move forward together by changing the country boldly.  This will be the question that citizens will be asked to answer tomorrow. And that is why, today, I will not go into much detail on the development plan of Central Greece with the 540 projects of 4.2 billion that we presented earlier. It is worthwhile, I believe, all those who are interested in the welfare of your country to read it, to study it.
