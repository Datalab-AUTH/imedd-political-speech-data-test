  But the place must not be left behind.  Our task, then, is to grit our teeth and turn sadness and anger into stubbornness for great changes. This is the big difference in the political ethos of this party.  For our part, we admitted that we did not bring to the OSE the changes that were made to other infrastructure, especially to the roads. In this field, therefore, our attempt at reform has been defeated.  It did not break down the wall long built by irresponsible statism and individual "pampering".  We lost this battle.
