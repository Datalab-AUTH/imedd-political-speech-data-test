But also in the face of the energy crisis, the state stood by the citizen.  You see it, I think, in your electricity bills, every month you see and you see in the last year the amount that you would have paid without the government subsidy and the amount that you end up paying. And we managed to keep the electricity bills down and we did it by taxing, mind you, the big electricity producers, not only with money from the state budget.  Proof that we are not only the party of development, but the great people's party of social justice.
