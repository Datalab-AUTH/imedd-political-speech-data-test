 The country is asking for clear horizons in its course, so it is asking for clear solutions in its leadership.  This can be described in five words: "Self-reliant Greece.  Independent New Democracy".  Only in this way, only in this way will we consolidate our conquests and be able to confront our failures more forcefully.  And I speak to you with my hand on my heart.  I always keep in mind, an admonition I often hear.  My fellow citizens who tell us that "it is time to confront even more forcefully the system as it has been structured so far".
