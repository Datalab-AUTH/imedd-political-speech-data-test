 The harm to the country and society will have been done.  And the landscape, unfortunately, is further blurred by those who talk about a supposed cooperation, but actually refer to paralysis. How else to interpret statements about coalition governments but without a Prime Minister chosen by the citizens? And what does this "unknown X" who will lead the next day mean?  That citizens will vote blindly.  One they want and another one to eventually emerge.  I'm sorry, but this is not serious stuff.
