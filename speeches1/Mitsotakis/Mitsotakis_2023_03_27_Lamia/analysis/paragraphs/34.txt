 I am well aware that the National Health System, although it stood up during the pandemic, still has serious shortcomings.  I know very well that the old deep state of inefficiency and mediocrity shows its teeth at every opportunity. I spoke in this way to illustrate two elements that I want you as party members to remind your interlocutors: firstly, I want you to remind us of the consistency of words and deeds in our policy, especially when our opponent had ordered us to tear up the memoranda with a law, to close the banks afterwards and to burden us with a third unnecessary memorandum. It matters.  It's important, you know, this consistency of words and deeds.  It is the one that ultimately builds trust relationships.
