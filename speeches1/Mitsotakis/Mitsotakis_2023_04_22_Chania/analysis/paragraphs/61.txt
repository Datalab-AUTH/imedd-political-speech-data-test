Having next to us - and this message is of great value in Crete - every citizen who has no party blinkers. Every citizen who believes in responsible patriotism and creative modernisation. To a great current of progress that calls for stability, continuity and consistency in our country's growth trajectory. It is, my friends, an exciting battle. It is a battle that I start today from my ancestral land. From you, from your applause, from your smiles I draw strength, I draw confidence for hope and for tomorrow. Go ahead, Chania, lift from your own waters the great wave of victory that will spread to every corner of our country. And let the cool wind of the White Mountains carry its message to every corner of our country.
