We will talk about a productive and social Greece, digital and green - environmentally green, because Greece will be blue and Chania will certainly be blue -, fair and strong. Keep five big priorities. In 2019 I looked you in the eye and said: I pledge to cut taxes for all and for all. Today I look you in the eye and I say to you: the next four years will be the four years of better wages for every Greek woman and every Greek man. We can increase our salaries by 25% in four years and in 2024 it will finally come into force in the public sector, because the salaries of civil servants have been frozen for many years, the new single pay scale. My purpose is simple.
