I thank our youth, the UNNED, the students of our Polytechnic. Better housing for youth. A big challenge for me, apart from the projects we are doing to provide the Polytechnic with student accommodation, with the partnership of the public and private sectors, is to keep in mind the great importance I attach to the "My House" programme. Do you know what it is for a young man to know now that he can own his house and take out a loan and pay a lower payment than he would have paid if he had rented a house, but in the end the house will stay with him? 10,000 young people will benefit from this programme. I have committed that once it is exhausted, I will double the funds.
