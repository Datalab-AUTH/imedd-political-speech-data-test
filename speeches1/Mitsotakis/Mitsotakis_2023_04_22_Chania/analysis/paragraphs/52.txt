With our vote on 21 May. Because then we are called upon to answer some simple questions: Are we moving forward or turning back? Do we want results or a return to lies? Do we want yesterday with taxes and cuts or do we want tomorrow with better pay? Do we want a government that will win in the rough and tumble or one that will shipwreck in the rough and tumble? Do we want a desperate homeland or an armoured homeland? Do we ultimately want a leader with a voice on the outside or a voiceless guest with a mind at home? In other words and very simply: Do we want New Democracy with Prime Minister Mitsotakis or do we want Syriza with Prime Minister Tsipras? This is the central question that citizens will answer on 21 May.
