Today the people of Chania are sending their own thunderous message of hope. A message of confidence, a slogan of victory, so that Constantine and Helen can celebrate in blue. Blue will not only be blue in Crete, it will be blue all over Greece. The whole territory. Because Greece remembers us, has seen us and knows us. He does not want a second time in misfortune but gives a second command to progress.
