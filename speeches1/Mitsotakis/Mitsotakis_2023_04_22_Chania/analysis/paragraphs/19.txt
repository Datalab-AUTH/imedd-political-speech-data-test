On culture, today you inaugurated together with the Minister of Culture a new museum in Messara, in Chania, a "jewel" our new museum. And this was done by the Government of the New Democracy. Projects to highlight the Minoan palaces, with a very innovative proposal that will soon be submitted to UNESCO. But, of course, also something that was the ardent desire of Constantine Mitsotakis: our mountains and especially the White Mountains are finally becoming "Apatity Mountains" and are fully protected, so that we can preserve this unique natural wealth that nature has so generously given us. Take a look at what is happening around us here in Chania.
