Our investments exceed 15 billion a year. The Greek economy came out of surveillance, it was upgraded 12 times. It is one step away from the investment grade, from cheaper lending for businesses and households, and just yesterday, Eurostat announced that 2022 ended for our country with a primary surplus against a forecast for a deficit, a small one, but a surplus. We exceeded expectations. The economy is doing better than what we had estimated. It is a dynamic that becomes larger in relation to public debt. Down 23 points.
