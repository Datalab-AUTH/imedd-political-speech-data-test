 Hospitality structures have been modernised.  It is a policy which is now recognised in Europe as the right one.  It is a policy that recognises and protects the Greek borders, which are also European borders, now extending the artificial barrier on Evros.  Some people question their usefulness, some people go as far as to demand that the European Commission not fund, watch out, such a project, so that all of you Greek taxpayers pay for it.  But I want to say one thing here from Ioannina: the artificial barrier, the fence as we are used to calling it, will definitely be built, either with European or national resources, because it is a national necessity.  It will happen no matter how much those who continue, unfortunately, to be the national exceptions, oppose it.  Because I really regret that on certain self-evident issues concerning foreign policy and national sovereignty, the political forces cannot agree on certain issues.
