 So I conclude by saying that from here, from this "Infinite Country", a vast country of antiquity, with its vast history, its vast contribution to the economy and culture, a new struggle begins, a struggle of which you, the heart of New Democracy, are the protagonist.  Explain, help me to win this struggle by explaining with facts and arguments our positions to our fellow citizens.  Decently expose the lies our opponents are spreading, answer our friends' questions or objections.
