 So, after four years, yes, we can say: that never, never in the post-independence period has any government encountered so many major problems in such a short period of time.  So many sudden and successive crises, so many unprecedented and complex crises.  Because I want to remind you that when we were faced with, let's say, the coronavirus crisis, there was no instruction manual on how to deal with it.  It was something completely unknown, unprecedented for all of us and we had to learn, to adapt, to deal with the crisis essentially on the move.  But we made a great effort to overcome these crises and we did it together.  And I will stick to this section.  It's the unity that we showed, say, in the first steps of the coronavirus response.  Not without fail, I will be the first to state clearly that we are not infallible and I will have the courage to take responsibility when I find clear errors.  But an error only becomes an error when it is repeated.
