 We will talk much more about our programme once the election period officially starts.  But hold on to three things that are central priorities for me for the next four years.  First, the continued growth momentum of our economy.  Catching up faster and faster with Europe.  If in 2019 I pledged and acted on lower taxes, today I pledge and will act that the next four years will be the four years of better wages and better incomes.  Not only for the private sector, where businesses already understand that in order to attract talent they have to pay more - with the help that we are already providing with all the training programmes, active labour policies that we are implementing - but also for the public sector, 1/1/2024 we will have a new single wage scale for civil servants.  We lost a lot in the decade of crisis, but we can by 2030 make up all the lost ground from Europe and no longer be at the bottom, but outperforming Europe on many indicators.  I am always inspired - I spoke to you before about the President of the Eurogroup - by the example of Ireland, a country which entered the European family poor, but which has made very good use of European aid, of its own momentum, and today has far surpassed the European average in terms of its economic performance.
