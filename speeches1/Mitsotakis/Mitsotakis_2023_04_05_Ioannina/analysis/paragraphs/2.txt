 And Ioannina, Epirus, sends today its own message of optimism and hope to every corner of the country.  From here, from this place which I love so much, from this place with its enormous contribution to the building of modern Greece, the wave of victory rises.  The wave that on May 21 will bring a new self-reliant government to take our country higher and further, for a second mandate for progress, to move, as our motto says, firmly, boldly, only forward.
