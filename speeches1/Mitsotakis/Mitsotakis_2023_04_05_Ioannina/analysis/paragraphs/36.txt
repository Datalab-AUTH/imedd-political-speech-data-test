 Public policy is to support vocational education, not just the children who go to university, post-secondary education, technical professions, where we have real shortages today.  Support public IEKs with new curricula that produce graduates with skills that can easily find jobs in a changing labour market.  And of course, public policy is to simplify the public sector.  The gov. gr was and is a revolution that must continue.  Remember your life before the gov. gr.  Wait in the queues at the CCP for the simplest transaction with the State.
