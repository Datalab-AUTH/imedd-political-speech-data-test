 Not only digitisation is not enough, individual awareness is also required.  It is an effort that has already started.  Finally, to stand again and say again how important our proposals will be for the new generation.  We have to be honest here, there is a difficulty today for the political system to communicate with your generation, especially the children who have grown up, gone through the years of adolescence or early adulthood in the crisis.  There is a gap of trust that we need to bridge.  And we will only do it by listening to you first of all, your concerns, your worries, your expectations, your aspirations and then with modesty and without big words to give real solutions to your demands, whether they concern better education, better jobs, the "My Home" programme for housing, which I have already spoken to you about.  How do we expand, say, the institution of social consideration.  We have so much public land on which we can build modern apartments.  Some of these will compensate builders, but the largest will be available to young people at a low rent.
