 We taxed the producers of electricity and we returned this taxation, these excess profits, to all and sundry, to the whole of Greek society.  And we have supported households with additional financial assistance to cope with imported precision, with measures that some have ridiculed, such as the Market Pass.  But other countries are now rushing to copy them, for the simple reason that they were effective.  And yes, today we still have inflation and accuracy is the number one problem that we are facing, but we have to look at the big picture and see that Greece has the fifth lowest inflation in the eurozone, we have managed - as far as possible - to contain price increases and I really believe that the hardest part on the inflation front is now behind us.  I want to reiterate that all this, believe me, was neither obvious nor easy, and even more so when, in addition to external difficulties, it had to be accompanied by solutions to long-standing shortcomings.
