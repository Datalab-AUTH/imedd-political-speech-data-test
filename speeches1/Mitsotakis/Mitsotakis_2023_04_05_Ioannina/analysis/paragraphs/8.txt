 The first thing I told you back then is that we're going to shake up the economy.  We will cut taxes, increase jobs, attract investment, modernise the state.  I told you then we will return to the middle class what the four years of SYRIZA deprived it of. I told you that I want a united society, and a united society means caring for the weakest.  To reduce, as far as possible, social inequalities.
