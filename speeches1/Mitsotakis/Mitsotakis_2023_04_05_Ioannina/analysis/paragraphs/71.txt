 If some people think that because there will probably be a second election, "we shouldn't bother so much, we shouldn't go and vote in the first ballot box", my answer is that there is no room for frivolity, no room for empty messages of so-called protest.  No error is corrected after the vote.  The evil for the country will be done.
