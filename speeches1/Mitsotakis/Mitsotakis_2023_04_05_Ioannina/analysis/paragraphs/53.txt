 The consistency of those who talk about justice with the slogan - note the irony - "justice everywhere" while they have two convicted Ministers in the Special Court.  The audacity of those who lately denounce division when they themselves proclaim, even today, "it's us or them" and threaten us all that it will be different the second time around.  So I tell them, from Ioannina, that they are in vain: there will be no second time in the disaster.  Our opponents go to the polls with false words.  I found it interesting that they have nothing of their own to say.
