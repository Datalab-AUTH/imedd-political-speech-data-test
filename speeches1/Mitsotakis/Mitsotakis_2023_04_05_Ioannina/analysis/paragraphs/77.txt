 Because we have proven that we can open up New Democracy, to grow it, to enrich it with members, with friends who may not have belonged to our traditional area, but who want to join this great current of real modernisation, of responsible patriotism.

Demanding better wages, not taxes and cuts again, with national certainty, not regressing into murky waters.  We will respond on 21 May.
