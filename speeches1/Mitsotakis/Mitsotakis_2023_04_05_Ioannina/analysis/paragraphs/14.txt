 For the first time we have managed to start reversing the brain drain.  Young children who left our country during the crisis are for the first time seriously considering returning.  And here I can tell you that I am particularly happy when I go to a high-tech company here in Ioannina, for example, and I see employees from Epirus who have returned from abroad to work in a high-tech company.  Not just in Greece, here in Ioannina.  This is the Greece of creation that I envision and that we want to build together.  But, friends, in 2019 I told you something else: that we cannot play with our national issues.  That we cannot tolerate Greece to be a "closed vineyard".  That we cannot accept the logic that the sea has no borders and that anyone can enter our country whenever and however they want, without anyone controlling them.  What we have achieved in these four years.
