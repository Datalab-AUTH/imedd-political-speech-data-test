 And growth is not an abstract concept, you know.  Growth is many small, medium and large efforts being made, many investments being launched, many jobs being created.  Together they create this foundation for collective progress, so that we can be one step up from the investment grade today.  And this investment grade, which you hear a lot about, is not just a term that should only apply to market experts.  The moment the country will finally get the much-needed investment grade, we can realistically expect to reduce the cost of borrowing, both for the Hellenic Republic and for the banks and households, finally.  That is why it is so important to obtain the investment grade and I will say again here in Ioannina - and you know that I don't like to brag about things that I am not absolutely sure about - but I look you in the eye and I tell you that if the elections result in a stable, strong government of New Democracy, Greece will obtain the investment grade within 2023.  But I want to repeat a rule that is inviolable for us.
