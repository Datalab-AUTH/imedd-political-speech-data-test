 And I assure you that every time we stumble we will not fall, but we will increase our speed.  And I ask you, let us consider here how timely - today when our enemy is our problems and the country must be united - how timely were those words of Constantine Karamanlis in our founding declaration that "we serve the nation above and beyond the misleading labels of the right, the centre and the left".  That is exactly why I believe that self-reliance is not a party expediency, it is a national necessity.  With a party as its core, of course, but not limited to it, nor limited to a single colour.
