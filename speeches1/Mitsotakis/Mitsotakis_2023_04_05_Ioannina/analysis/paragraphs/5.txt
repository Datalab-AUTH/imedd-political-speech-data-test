 Islands of an anachronistic yesterday that resists and has managed to take revenge on us before we uproot it, making the battle against it even more urgent.  I want to declare to you today that I am even more determined to confront all those foci that are holding our country back.  I will do it, we will do it together, with more conviction, with more momentum, but above all to implement even faster the great changes that our country needs so much.  So that by making our country better, we become better with it.  But, friends, all these adversities that have befallen us have not broken us.  And they did not bend us because the state, the state, the government stood by the citizens and businesses that were being tested.  We spent more than â‚¬50 billion to tackle the coronavirus scourge.
