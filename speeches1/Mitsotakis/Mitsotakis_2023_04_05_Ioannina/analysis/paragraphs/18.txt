 We owe them a big thank you from Ioannina.  And this is just one side of the "blue shield".  The other side of it is highlighted by our national diplomacy, by the defence agreements and treaties that we have signed with the United States, with France, by the many inter-state agreements, peace and security agreements, and by the.  Because today we are not only consolidating our alliances with powerful states, with traditional allies, we are expanding our influence everywhere, from North America to Japan, the Balkans, which are so important for the northwest corner of Greece.  Greece has returned to the Balkans with renewed vigour and is claiming the role it deserves, which is none other than that of a protagonist.  And our voice is now heard loud and respected in all international fora, from the US Congress and the UN to Brussels and the major capitals of the world.  And I must tell you that it is a great satisfaction for us when our European partners also recognise that Greece is now entering the discussions that take place in the European Union not as the bad boy of Europe, as it was for many years, not as a beggar claiming support programmes, debt relief, but as a proud and equal country, which can now participate effectively in European affairs and have its voice heard everywhere, with confidence and power.
