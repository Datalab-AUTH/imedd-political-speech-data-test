 Because we feel, we listen, we try, we fight, we learn and we move forward.  We are ambitious in our ambitions, but we have proved that we can achieve them.  And in this exciting journey towards the new victory, I want you all by my side for a second strong mandate for progress, for Epirus, the Greece of 2030, without compromise, with the flags high, with one slogan: firmly, boldly, only forward.  Be well, have a good race, Happy Resurrection, Happy Easter and goodbye.
