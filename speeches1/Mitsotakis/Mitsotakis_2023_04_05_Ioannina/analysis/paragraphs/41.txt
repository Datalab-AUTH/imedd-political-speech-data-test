 The "My Home" programme.  I talked before about housing, about the difficulty that young couples have in getting a house.  Ten thousand of our young citizens, young couples can now - the programme is already running - apply.  House up to 150. 000 euros, to own their own home by repaying a soft loan at a cost lower than what you would pay if you were renting a house.  Why the largest part of the interest rate is subsidised by the State.
