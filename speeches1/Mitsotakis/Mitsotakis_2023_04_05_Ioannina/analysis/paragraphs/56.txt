 They're repeating it now with the water issue.  We need to make a big effort to manage our water resources better, to have a modern water supply, to reduce losses, to have cheaper water eventually, to help our farmers have more water, to collect water, to reuse it.  All this, which is nothing more than a coherent strategy for managing the most valuable resource we have.  Some call it, he says, "privatisation".  With songs and concerts, in fact, to entice people.  That's how they become liars after music.
