 But we must also make responsible behaviour.  And that's what the last accident taught us in a way that we must not relive.  Let me put it differently: if until today we have managed to "stay in Europe" -remember this slogan, so timely, because we must not forget, friends, what happened in 2015, let us not forget how close we came to total catastrophe-, now we can say that "we are Europe", but we are still called upon to cover great distances from Europe and to "become Europe" everywhere and in everything.  And we can and we will.  Because any grey clouds that still exist cannot obscure the clear horizons that have now opened up.
