 The parental benefits tax - we added this, we didn't have it in our election program, we abolished the tax on parental benefits up to 800. 000 euros, so that property can be transferred from parents to children without paying additional taxes.  The world of labour, workers and businesses were telling us then: watch out for the issue of taxation on labour.  The contributions are high, and indeed the contributions were very high.  We reduced them by four points, easing the burden on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, adding income for workers.  And I committed in 2019 that my intention is to raise the minimum wage at twice the rate of GDP growth.  We also exceeded the target we set.  Increased 20%.  At 650 euros we received it, at 780 euros it is today.
