 And all this without mentioning other achievements: the digital working card.  It was also fought by the opposition, but today it protects workers and really safeguards their overtime.  The reform of supplementary insurance for young workers.  Every young person today, when he or she is insured on a supplementary basis, has his or her own individual piggy bank, his or her own fund and "a little bit of money fills the bag".

The Personal Assistant for the disabled, already a measure that is being implemented.  And of course since yesterday, the latest announcement of this government, the 8% increase in all disability benefits of the OPEKA.
