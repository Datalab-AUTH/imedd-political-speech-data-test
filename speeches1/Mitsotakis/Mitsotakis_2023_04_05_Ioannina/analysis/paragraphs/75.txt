 In this way we will consolidate our conquests, but we will also confront our failures more forcefully: by making the country better and by making ourselves better.  And for this to happen, we need to reshape this patriotic and modernising current that in 2019 came together to pull the country out of its stagnation and put it on a path of progress.  I know that among us there may be fellow citizens who will trust us for the first time in these elections, because in 2019 they did not dare to take the step.  But I know that some people who trusted us in '19 and are now hesitant may be with us or listening to us.  I will tell them again what I have already said: we may have hurt you at times, but we have never betrayed you.
