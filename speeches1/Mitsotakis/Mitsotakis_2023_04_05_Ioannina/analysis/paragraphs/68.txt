 We are the ones who reshaped our aviation industry to be able to implement today's aircraft modernization programs.  And we were the ones who revived the EFKA, so that at last it would pay its pensions on time.  Young Democrats, only we, therefore, can take on the past as well as our bad selves.  And that is why I will say it again: we speak about our work, knowing that it is the consistency of words and deeds that ultimately forges the relationships of trust that we have with our citizens.  But for one more reason, it highlights something very important: there is nothing that bothers me more, my friends - and I am referring especially to the young people who are in the audience today - than those who claim that this is Greece and it is not changing.  No, friends, the place can change and is changing.  Often not as quickly as we would like, but it changes.  And it goes in one direction only, which is the direction of progress.  And that calls for us, but that is also the project, I would say, of the next four years, to go faster, more boldly to the changes we want.  For this to happen, however, a "mine" must be unlocked.
