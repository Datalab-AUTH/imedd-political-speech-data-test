 You are very fortunate to have an excellent university in Ioannina, which provides excellent quality education, but above all it connects the local economy with education, as it should in any modern academic system.  And of course I attach great importance to the restoration of archaeological sites, in Nicopolis, in Dodoni.  And of course in the protection of the environment, this unique environment that you have here in Epirus, which is your great comparative advantage.  Your two great mountains, Smolica and Tymphi, are now "Apatity mountains".  This means that no wind turbines can be put in, no other major works can be done other than very basic maintenance works.  And a personal commitment of mine, a struggle that I have been giving for a long time, that Zagori should finally be included in the list of Unesco's cultural landscapes.
