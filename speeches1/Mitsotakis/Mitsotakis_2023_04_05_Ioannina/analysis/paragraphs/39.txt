 This is the Greece that is really changing.  A Greece with new infrastructure projects, with roads running through the whole country, with the Athens Metro spreading, the Thessaloniki Metro completed, new airports, new ports.  A country that is becoming an international energy hub, at the same time as we are exploiting our natural "fuels".  We are champions, one of the top ten countries in the world, we generate almost 50% of our electricity from the sun and wind.
