 We took a weak OTE and privatised it, made it a giant.  We saved the PPA, we saved the PPC from the "labour traitors" and transformed it into a modern competitive enterprise that can today support consumers.  We are the ones who gave new life to our shipyards.  Very beautiful pictures I saw a few days ago with the workers at the Elefsina shipyards lifting a tank that had been submerged for ten years by water and starting to work again with many ships waiting to go to Elefsina to be repaired.
