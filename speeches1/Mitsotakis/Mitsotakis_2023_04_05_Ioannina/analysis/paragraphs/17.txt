 But society agrees and Evros unites us and strengthens us, just as the 24 new Rafale fighters strengthen us, as the 84 F-16 Vipers strengthen us, as the three frigates - two of which are already being built in the French shipyards - strengthen us, new corvettes that we will soon order, the modern means of the army, the new ships that we will soon order, and the modern equipment of the army.  But above all, the members of the Armed Forces, the women and men of the Greek Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Forces, Coast Guard, Police, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, without holidays, without vacations, make us strong and proud.  It is they and they who are up and awake so that we can all sleep soundly.
