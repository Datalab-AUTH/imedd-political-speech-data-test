 Greece of 2023 is nothing like the country of closed banks, taxes, unemployment, the international margin.  Yesterday we had the great pleasure of welcoming the President of the Eurogroup in our country.  Do you remember how much this institution had troubled us in the past, when it punitively asked our country to impose and take new austerity measures?  What the President of the Eurogroup said yesterday.  And I want to read it exactly as he said it: "After the election, the new government will have a healthier economic outlook, with a stronger economic foundation than any previous government, and that's because of the work you've done and the tough decisions you've made.".  Mr.  Donohoe: "a job that has delivered results and strengthened your resilience just at a time when we all need it".  I will not add anything else.
