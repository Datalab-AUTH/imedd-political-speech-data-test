 President, let's remember together where we started.  Because it is true that in the last four years as a country, as a Greek people, we have gone through and overcome a lot: from the illegal invasions of migrants in Evros to the waves of the pandemic, and from the constant national challenges to a war on our continent.  The ensuing energy crisis, the imported precision which tests the disposable income not only of Greeks but of all Europeans.  Together we experienced painful moments, such as the Tempi.  They are tests that have revealed long-standing gaps and weaknesses.
