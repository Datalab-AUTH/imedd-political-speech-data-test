 But why vote for something that you don't know what it will be tomorrow.  All the more so when decisions today need to be swift and coordinated.  We have no time, we have no room for party bargaining, for endless debates.

And the answer to that is just five words: self-reliant Greece, self-reliant New Democracy.
