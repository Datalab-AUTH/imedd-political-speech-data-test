 Obviously not.  And I want to remind you that when I asked for your trust in 2019 I did not promise miracles.  I'm not some magician who can pull rabbits out of hats.  I promised hard work and measurable results.  But we know that we have great difficulties ahead of us.  I know very well, I know it especially when I talk to young children, that wages in our country are still low.  I know very well that young children, young couples, are finding it difficult today to find a home.  Many young children find it difficult to leave home, live on their own, become independent, start a family.
