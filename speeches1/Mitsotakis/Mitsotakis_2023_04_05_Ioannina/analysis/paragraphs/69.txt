 And this is the "mine" of the simple proportional representation left behind by SYRIZA, a trap that leads either to ungovernability or to very dangerous potential alliances.  Let those who continue to defend the simple proportional representation go and see what is happening in our neighbouring Bulgaria.

We do not want such adventures in our country.  We want stability, we want perspective.
