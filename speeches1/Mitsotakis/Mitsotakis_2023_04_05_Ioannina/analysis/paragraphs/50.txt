 Friends, I have told you all this not because I want to spend too much time taking stock of our work, but because it is extremely important to demonstrate the consistency of words and deeds, words and deeds.  Because only if we convince the citizens that what we told them during the election we have implemented, then they will believe us and what we will tell them that we want to do in the second four-year term.  So much has been done, but - I want to stress - much more must, can and will be done.
