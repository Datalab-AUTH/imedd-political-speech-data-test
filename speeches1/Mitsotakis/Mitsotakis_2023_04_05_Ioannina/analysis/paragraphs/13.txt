 One of the central objectives that I had set, friends, is to attract many investments back to our country.  The first problem we have faced and continue to face is the problem of unemployment.  And if I had to single out one success of the government that I am particularly proud of, it is the fact that in four years and in these difficult circumstances we have reduced unemployment by 7 percentage points and created almost 300. 000 new jobs.  These jobs are not all at minimum wage.  Many jobs are well-paid positions.
