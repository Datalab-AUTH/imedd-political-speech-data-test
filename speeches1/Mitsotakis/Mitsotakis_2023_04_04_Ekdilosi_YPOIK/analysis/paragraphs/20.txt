 Firstly, that our national initiatives have always been accompanied by European initiatives.  We did not go to the European fora, to the Eurogroup, to the European Council, to the European Council of Ministers, talking only about our own problems, demanding only settlements that would be in the interest of our country.  Obviously we did that too.
