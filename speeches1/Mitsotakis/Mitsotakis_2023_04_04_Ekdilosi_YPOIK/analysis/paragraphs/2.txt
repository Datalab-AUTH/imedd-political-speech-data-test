And nothing else in 2023 reminds us of the over-indebted country of the memorandum surveillance, the one that after the capital controls, after the many cuts in wages and pensions, had zero growth, but also low international credibility, with a traumatized and divided society, with the main electricity provider on the verge of bankruptcy, with annual losses of hundreds of millions of euros. So, in the summer of 2019, we made a new start.  Four years later we have made up for losses in average income, we have boosted our productivity, our investment, our exports.  National product returns this year to 2010 levels while the close of 2022 finds us with the second highest growth in the Eurozone.  This, combined with the strong performance of tourism, is something that we are optimistic will maintain the positive momentum even amid concerns about an international economic downturn. But, ladies and gentlemen, the growth indicator is not an end in itself.
