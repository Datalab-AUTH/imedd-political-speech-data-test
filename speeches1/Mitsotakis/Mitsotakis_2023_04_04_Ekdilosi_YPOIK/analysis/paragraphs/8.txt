 And since then I had described our economic targeting as a triangle with parallel political directions on equal sides. The first side of the triangle was bold reforms that would make our economy more competitive, bridge the investment and productivity gap.  And many of these have been implemented, including the modernisation of the labour market, the radical overhaul of the investment environment, the capitalisation system in supplementary insurance, since we are talking about how we can use our savings for development purposes. And of course the National Plan "Greece 2. 0", which is so far the catalyst for more than 100 cutting-edge investments, a plan which - I want to stress - is Greek-owned, a plan which combines investments with bold reform goals.  A project that has led the Greek economy to already receive 11 billion of European funds, a project in which Greece has been a leader in the way it perceives the use of European funds to launch a great leap forward in development.
