We have pursued a flexible and growth-oriented tax policy, but watch out, we have done it - and I think this is the great success of our policy - without threatening fiscal discipline.  And it is indicative that the primary deficit in 2022 - I will be a bit more conservative in my estimates until we see the official data - but it will certainly be much lower than expected.  And my commitment is fully valid, in 2023, dear Paschal, the country will produce a primary surplus.  But it is a primary surplus that comes from growth and not from overtaxation.
