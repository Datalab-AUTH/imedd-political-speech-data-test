Dear colleagues in the government and in Parliament, Mr.Governor of the Bank of Greece, Your Eminence, Mr.President of the Eurogroup, dear Paschal, thank you very much for your kind and generous words, they mean a lot to me and my colleagues.  But I think they mean a lot to the Greeks who have suffered a lot and I am satisfied for the first time in many years because we can look to the future with more optimism. Ladies and gentlemen, while listening to the very interesting presentations so far, I was thinking about Charles Darwin's central thesis that "he survives who ultimately adapts best to change" and I think this sums up the evolution of the Greek economy over the last four years. Because, indeed, in less than 45 months and even through many successive crises, our country managed to keep pace with the international environment, managed to integrate our national needs, our national priorities into the demands of the times.  He managed to leap in his steps to make up for lost time, so that Greece is the pleasant surprise of Europe today.
