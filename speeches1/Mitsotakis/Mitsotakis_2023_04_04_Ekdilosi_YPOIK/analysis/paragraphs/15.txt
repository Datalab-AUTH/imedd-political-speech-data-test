 The specific indicators that we have talked to you about today may be of particular interest to anyone who knows how to translate numbers and who is concerned with the big picture of the economy.  What is very important for us is that the everyday citizen should feel that from these indicators, from this progress that we have talked to you about, his or her own better life also results.  I believe that this is something that gradually, despite the difficulties and despite the problems that we have faced and despite the mistakes that may have been made, is now being recognised in good faith by Greeks.
