 There is absolutely no reason why Greece should not be able to achieve a similar great leap forward in terms of development. And it is this national necessity that demands that the country be punched with the same certainty on the same upward trajectory.  It is something that I believe will soon be sealed by the choice of Greek citizens in the coming elections. Our fellow citizens have experienced this transition from populism to realism and from fixation to progress.  They will compare and judge, weigh and decide.
