And the third side of the triangle I talked to you about was the consolidation of the banking system.  There was a strong concern in 2019 about the stability of banks, mainly due to the fact that our banks still had more than 40% of "red" loans on their balance sheets.  And from that 45% where red loans were in July 2019, they have now fallen to single digits in September 2022.  Two systemic banks increased their share capital with private capital, not public money.  All are now fully shielded from international turbulence. And I'm sure that not many people four years ago could have foreseen a situation in which banks in Switzerland would be shaken, but our banks would have high capital adequacy and credit institutions would once again begin to perform their main purpose, which is to finance the real economy. Yesterday, it was announced the expansion of the perimeter of the beneficiaries of the housing loan subsidy program.
