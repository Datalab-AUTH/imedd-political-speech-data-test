 Treating - like you, I am sure - what we have discussed today not as a review, but as a milestone.  As a milestone on an exciting journey, a journey that through difficulties, through adversity, can still hold many more successes for our country and its citizens. With a milestone, therefore, on Sunday 21 May, when united Greeks will give a second strong mandate to progress, so that a self-reliant Greece can move forward as it deserves, firmly, boldly and only forward. Thank you.
