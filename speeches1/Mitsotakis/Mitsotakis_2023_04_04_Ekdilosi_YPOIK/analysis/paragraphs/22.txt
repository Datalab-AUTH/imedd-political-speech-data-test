 But Europe has proved and is proving that it can eventually, even if sometimes it takes more time and more detailed consultations, come up with solutions that are in the interest of European citizens and that strengthen the overall resilience and adaptability of the European Union. And of course, the same applies to the big challenge of the coming months, and I'm talking about the new Stability Pact, an issue that we've been working on a lot, we've discussed it at length with my friend Paschal, Greece has put forward very detailed proposals. But one thing is clear, and I think we agree on this not only with the President of the Eurogroup but also with most of my colleagues, that in the current context the old rules are ineffective.  We need to learn from the lessons of the crisis and especially from the lessons of countries like Ireland and Greece, which have suffered and suffered to get on the right track.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past.
