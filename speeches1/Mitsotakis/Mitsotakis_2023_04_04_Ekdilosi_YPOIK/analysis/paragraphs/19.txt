 I come to the undeniable conclusion that in four years Greece has gone from being the bad, the problem child of Europe to a good example in many ways.  I am reminded of how many once divided and disillusioned Greeks are now armed with more confidence, more optimism, despite the fact - as I said - that we still face many challenges, many difficulties.  I believe we have every reason to be satisfied with the progress we have made. Allow me, however, to conclude with two comments.
