 We pledged in 2019 that we would cut taxes and we cut taxes.  We cut more than 50 taxes, while at the same time reducing the contributions of workers and employers. Taxpayers now pay lower ENFIA, lower income tax, the solidarity contribution has been abolished for everyone, parental benefits have practically become free, corporate tax has fallen to 22%, dividend tax to 5%.  But we also used taxation as an incentive, as an investment incentive to invest in innovation.  As an incentive to enable, for example, innovation companies, start-ups, to give stock options to their employees.
