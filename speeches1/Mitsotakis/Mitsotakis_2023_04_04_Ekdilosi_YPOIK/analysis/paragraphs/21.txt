 But at the same time, we have also helped to shape a more resilient European policy. To recall our contribution to the introduction of the single digital vaccination certificate, at a time when nobody in Europe was talking about how we could travel and how we could get the tourism industry moving again. Let me also recall our very active participation in the establishment of the Recovery Fund.  When we first talked, along with other heads of state and government, about the Recovery Fund, many in Europe thought at the time that it would be impossible for the most fiscally conservative countries in Europe to take this bold step.  And yet, five months later, in a marathon negotiation that lasted five days, Europe took a great leap into the future.  It decided to borrow supranationally at the European level to support countries' development to overcome the pandemic crisis and at the same time link these developments to key strategic European objectives such as green growth, digitalisation, skills support. Greece was present in all these discussions, just as we were present as Greeks in the recent formulation of a mechanism to control gas prices.  We were a little late, we paid a lot more money in gas imports than we would have had we moved earlier.
