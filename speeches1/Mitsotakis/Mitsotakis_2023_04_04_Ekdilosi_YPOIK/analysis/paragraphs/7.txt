And something, which I think is also important.  Christos referred to our country's issuance strategy, the strategy of issuing public debt, which was the one that supported the cash reserves throughout this difficult period.  Hold on to the fact that Greece successfully issued a five-year bond just one day after the announcement of the national elections.  Proof that the international community trusts both the present and the future of the country. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, the above did not happen, did not come at the push of a button.  I want to remind you that in 2019, from this very place where we presented our programme at that time, I did not promise miracles.  But I had promised, I had outlined a vision.  And I had talked to you about a specific plan for the recovery of our economy.  I was committed to one thing: a lot of hard work.
