Today, there is no unaccompanied refugee child who is not in a facility that is suitable to deal with the problems of a teenager or adolescent who is away from his or her family in a foreign country. The same picture of progress, however, also applies to asylum procedures.  When we came into the picture, in 2019, those who supposedly cared about refugees and migrants bequeathed us 200. 000 pending asylum applications.  Only in the first two months of 2023 we had 990 organized departures from our country.  And that was because we were able to process these asylum applications. Currently there are less than 20 pending applications.
