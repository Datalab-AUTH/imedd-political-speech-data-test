 And when they were finally found and started to talk, we understood that this whole story, which was dragging the country abroad, was nothing more than a badly played lie. A lie, unfortunately, which was adopted with great ease by some political forces within our country in order to hurt the government, only they did not understand that it was the prestige of the country that was being hurt and not the government. I would like to take this opportunity to stress the need for the policy of instrumentalizing refugees and migrants to stop and to be stopped by the neighbouring country with which we have the opportunity to cooperate - we have done so in the past - and to manage this difficult issue, which also has a strong humanitarian dimension. Greece will welcome any positive step at any time.  We know from the past that sometimes these things, of course, are noted. We will always oppose any aggression with readiness.  But I want to stress that we welcome the goodwill shown by Turkey in recent months.  We are always ready to give back.  But we are not naive.  We are intentional but not naive. And we really hope that between now and the elections - which are taking place in Greece and Turkey at about the same time - we can create good conditions so that after the elections we can pick up the thread of our differences again, but always guided by international law.  So we are happy about this good climate but in no way - you know this better than I do - do we rest on our laurels.
