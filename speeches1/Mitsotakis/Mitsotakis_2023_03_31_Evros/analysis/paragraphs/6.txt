 Because this new section of the artificial barrier of Evros that will be built will add 35 more kilometres from Psathades to Kornofolia.  With autonomous surveillance systems and new outposts of both the Army and the Police.  And with even more border guards, which will increase by 250. I was delighted to hear the earlier story and the passion with which a young border guard spoke about what she does, emphasizing that the vast majority of new border guards here come from the Evros region.  I think you have other experiences and you may possibly understand even better the specificity, the difficulty, but also the importance of your function.
