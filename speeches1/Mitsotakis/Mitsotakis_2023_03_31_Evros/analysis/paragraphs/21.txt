 These people will come legally, work legally, be able to return to their country and all of this will be done legally and controlled, not uncontrolled.  This is the big difference between our policy on immigration and the policy of the previous government. And of course, we must not forget that we are also voting for a new Immigration Code.  It is a section that definitively clarifies the conditions of legal residence of some people in our country.  It allows, for example, even minor children who came and studied in a Greek school to stay in our country and claim a better future here, if - again, I stress - they have spent three years in a Greek school.
