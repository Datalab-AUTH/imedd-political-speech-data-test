But let me conclude by returning to the experience of the fence and its extension.  An expansion that - I repeat - will be made and will be made even with national resources, in spite of those who oppose it.  I will say it again: this investment that you see is not a cheap investment, but it is an investment that is necessary to shield our borders. We will continue at all levels to fight for its funding with European resources.  And I believe that this goal is achievable.  But the construction of the deterrent barrier is a national imperative. But there is something else, which I want to emphasize: it is a shining example of the state we want, with central planning by the state, with excellent coordination between the Army, the Police, the Border Guards, the Coast Guard, the National Intelligence Service.  With continuous training in modern media.
