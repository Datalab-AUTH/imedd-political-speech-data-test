I regret that I have to say this here, but I want to stress that this attitude is essentially a national exception, all the more so when it comes after the adoption of miserable lies about alleged incidents which some people say took place here in Evros, but which turned out to be lies. Because I remember very well - I remember it too, the Ministers remember it too - the "little Maria" incident.  When we were looking to find out where these people were, on which island of Evros they had been found.
