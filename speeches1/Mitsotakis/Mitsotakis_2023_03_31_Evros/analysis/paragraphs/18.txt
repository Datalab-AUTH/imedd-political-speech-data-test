Here I want to emphasize, and congratulate both Ministers, because they have many overlapping responsibilities on these issues, the fact that Europe has changed its approach to the refugee issue in recent years. You know, when we were talking about border protection as a country of first reception and the need to be more - I would say - effective in deterring us, many in Europe looked at us with a jaundiced eye.  Perhaps from the safety of their own places, far from the borders, they could not understand and perceive what is really happening here in Evros. But after a lot of systematic work, several cooperation schemes have been created: the MED5, the group of the five first Mediterranean host countries: Greece, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus.
