Because I want to remind you that a prominent member of SYRIZA asked - just the other day - from the European Parliament, in an urgent way, expressing an obviously different view on the way the country's immigration policy should be exercised, that the European Union should not finance such artificial barriers at its borders because they are supposed to violate international legality. Let me put it very simply: what SYRIZA is asking for today is that the project you see here, this expensive project, because - as you can see - we are talking about a heavy construction, that the European Union does not pay for it, as it could under certain conditions, but that you all pay for it, the Greek taxpayer. Therefore, from here I must ask the leader of the opposition something again which he carefully avoids to answer: does he want to continue the construction of the fence or not?  Or does it ultimately seek to demolish this project that has been built.
