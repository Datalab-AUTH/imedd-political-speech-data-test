 We want to be able to give the opportunity as Europe, but I dare say also as Greece, to be able to accept human resources in an organised way, but - let me emphasise - also on our own terms, especially in areas where we know that we have shortages. Although unemployment in our country is falling fast, it is still above 10%, yet you know very well that in the agricultural sector, in the tourism sector, our country has a shortage of labour.  We can launch schemes of bilateral agreements, new schemes, where we can welcome residents, nationals of other countries to work in our country.  But we will do this - I stress - in an organised way and on our own terms.
