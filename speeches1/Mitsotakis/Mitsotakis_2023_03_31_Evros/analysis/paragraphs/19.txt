 But also our northern neighbours, Baltic countries and other countries are members of the Vilnius initiative, they are countries that have effectively endorsed the need to protect European borders. I have to tell you that I am particularly pleased because at the European Council in February, for the first time Europe, at the highest level, in the European Council conclusions, recognised that the starting point for an effective migration policy for Europe is the protection of external borders. Only if we protect our external borders can we address the issues of secondary flows, relocations, returns, but also the policies of organised reception of migrants on European territory. Because this is the other side of the coin.
