 And of course, as we have heard from our two previous speakers, with a high sense of responsibility. So on behalf of all Greek women and all Greeks I want to say a very big thank you to the women and men of the Border Guard, the Greek Police as a whole, our Coast Guard, our Armed Forces.  Their faces reflect our determination to keep our country safe and our society ready to continue on the road to prosperity.  A goal that, as I said, is not only national but is also European now. And all of the above I believe refutes a number of defeatist claims that this Greece "will never change".  On the contrary, what happened in Evros and with the support, and I want to stress this, of the local society - a big thank you from the bottom of my heart to the people of Evros, they have put a lot of backbone and they are putting a lot of backbone.
