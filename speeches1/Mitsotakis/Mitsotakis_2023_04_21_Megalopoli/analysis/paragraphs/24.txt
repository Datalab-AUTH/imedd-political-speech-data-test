We have a plan for Greece. We have a vision for Greece. We are inspired by the history of our great party, the New Democracy. We know that we have always been the ones who have made the nationally correct and imperative decisions for our country. We will do the same now. Together we can dream of a much better Greece, for all and for all, where no one is left behind. I repeat, this has a special reference for you here in Megalopolis and what I ask you is that you give me, as you did in 2019 - and I believe I did not contradict you - give me the strength to make our plan a reality.
