But I want to say two special words about the problems that you are facing here in Megalopolis. I want young farmers - whom we have supported - and young livestock farmers who can come back into the primary sector, who can produce products that are competitively priced. To reduce production costs overall, with photovoltaics that farmers and livestock farmers can also use, so that you can really be competitive. This is our vision for the primary sector. But here, in Megalopolis, I know very well that I am in a city that was and still is to a large extent the "energy heart" of our country. You know very well that the transition, as we gradually move away from lignite, increases the obligation of the state and my obligation personally to be able to give a developmental outlet to a city that was largely identified with the production of electricity from lignite. I want you to know that I personally, myself, at the 2020 European Council, fought hard to be able to secure the resources that today allow us to have a Fair Transition Fund with very favourable funding and the most favourable incentives throughout Greece, so that we can attract other kinds of investments here in Megalopolis. I know there have been delays.
