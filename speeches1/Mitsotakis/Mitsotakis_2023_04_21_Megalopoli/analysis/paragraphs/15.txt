You will never hear from me things that I know I am not able to deliver in the next four years. You'll never hear that from me. It's very easy, you know, when you're the leader of the Opposition and you know, more or less, that you're going to lose the election, to come and say: "I'm going to cut taxes, I'm going to raise wages, I'm going to write off all the loans, I'm going to give away houses.". And I don't know what else Mr. Tsipras.
