If the beans come out, I have no doubt he will hesitate to do so. But we have an obligation to ensure that the pips do not fall out and that New Democracy will be strong in the ballot box on May 21, so that we can continue on the course we have already set. So let me ask you, after thanking you again for being here today. I would ask you, and especially our executives, as the election period officially starts tomorrow and we have four weeks until the elections, to fight the race with dignity. We will not become SYRIZA and we will not become SYRIZA under any circumstances in terms of the quality of public discourse, in terms of vulgarity and in terms of toxicity. Because you see, on the occasion of the recent events that have come to light, that those who were digging the pit of toxicity and christening an entire party - you remember those hashtags on the internet, #NDviolent, #pederast and all these incredible squalor that we were hearing. You see, now, how life works out and all these miseries come back to bite you.
