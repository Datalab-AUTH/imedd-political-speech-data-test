Have we made mistakes? Of course we have made mistakes. But you tell me if you remember another Prime Minister who courageously, in the face of any mistake, stood before the Greek citizens and told them, "I take responsibility, I learn from my mistakes and I will correct the mistakes. That's what I did during the four years and that's what I will continue to do. Infallible is only the one who does absolutely nothing.
