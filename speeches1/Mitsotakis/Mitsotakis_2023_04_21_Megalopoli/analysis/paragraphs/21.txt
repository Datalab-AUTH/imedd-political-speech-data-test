Think of a scenario of a Tsipras - Androulakis - Varoufakis coalition government. Varoufakis returning as Finance Minister, Tsipras as Prime Minister, I don't know which other executives, Polakis as Health Minister. I don't know what else you can think of. But this scenario, which we call "the government of the losers", is mathematically a possible scenario. And when Mr. Tsipras, "I am not going to make a government of the losers", I tell you, here from Megalopolis, that I do not believe a single word of what Mr. Tsipras.
