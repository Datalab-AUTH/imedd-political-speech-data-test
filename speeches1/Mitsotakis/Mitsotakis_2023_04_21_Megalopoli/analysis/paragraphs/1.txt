"Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayor, friends, neo-democrats, citizens of Megalopolis, thank you for this warm welcome, thank you for your applause. We are, in fact, one day before the official announcement of the elections. Tomorrow I will go to the President of the Republic and propose the dissolution of the Parliament, so that we can go to elections on May 21. Keep in mind that elections are held at the end of four years, as I have been committed to for several years.
