In addition, an appropriate solution should be provided so that the fleet of garbage trucks can leave the area of Icarus, where it is currently located inside the stadium of the area, where hundreds of children play sports. This decision was eventually cancelled thanks to mobilizations. All in all, the question of the use of the remaining free spaces is a political and class issue. In an area in need of such spaces, we see stadiums languishing with huge infrastructure problems. We see mega-commercials springing up, various big commercials here to make big profits for the owners, big soup marketers, and others. And the city teams are squeezed into just one stadium to train thousands of children. There are dozens of old factories in the township that have been left as "carcasses". The issue of open space is a problem that affects all neighborhoods and ultimately is born out of a system and policy that treats land and its use as a commodity. It is about who gets to use the land and for what purpose. Who "owns" it? Who gets to choose what gets built, and who gets access? In the current conditions of capitalist ownership of land, development based on the profit of the groups, anarchy of production, and the rivalries of the robber capitalists, land is exploited according to the investment plans and profitability of each individual group. Profit means that the workers are squeezed dry, profit means that the land is exploited as a tool of shameful profitability.
