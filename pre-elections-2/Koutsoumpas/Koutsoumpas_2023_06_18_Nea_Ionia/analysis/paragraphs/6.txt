You also have experience with the large and diverse mobilizations from last year, so that the site of the former coal mine is not turned into a rubbish dump next to the schools in the area, but is reserved by the municipality and used for the vital needs of the people and youth. It should be highlighted as a site of great historical memory and heritage, to teach the new generations that the miners, among other things, were the soul of the National Resistance struggle in the area, and that at the Kalogreza blockade, the 21 executed were communist miners.
