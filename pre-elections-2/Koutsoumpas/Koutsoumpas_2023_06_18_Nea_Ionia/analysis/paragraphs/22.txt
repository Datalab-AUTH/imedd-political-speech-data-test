Friends, we invite you to ignore those who are upset about the rise of the KKE on behalf of the system and are doing everything they can to reverse it. Here in Nea Ionia, for example, both the oldest and the youngest are learning and they all know something about the dirty tricks of the old PASOK. They remember the blackmail to steal and capture the votes of working people. Tsipras is now countering the same tricks by saying that every vote that does not go to him or SYRIZA serves the New Democracy project. However, leftists and progressive people hear this and shudder, just as the same voters of SYRIZA used to shudder when PASOK used to say these things back then. Mr. Tsipras continues and scratches his head again when he takes a direct picture of our party, the KKE, and says that it makes no difference even if it goes from 7 to 8%, while what matters is whether SYRIZA's share rises. What are you telling us? Get this, the exact opposite is true for the workers of Nea Ionia, the northern sector, and the whole country.
