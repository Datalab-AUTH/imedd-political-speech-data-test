So let's all make our decisions now. Follow the example of thousands of people who voted for the Communist Party of Greece for the first time on May 21. We know that the rise of the KKE was not the only element of the election result that made you smile or reconsider, but you all saw that the KKE's share was the only positive step in this overall negative correlation. Let's do even more and make the smiles on people's faces even wider. We also appeal to fighters and people of our nation who in the past followed PASOK but eventually abandoned it.
