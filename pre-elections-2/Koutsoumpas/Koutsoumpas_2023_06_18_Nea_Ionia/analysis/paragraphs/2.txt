Anger towards this international criminal organization that all our other parties present as the common home of the people: the European Union. It first unleashes interventions, robs other people, and then erects fortresses to keep them out, or opens the spigot only for those its monopolies want to squeeze as cheap labor. These are the rotten values of the EU, which are being sniveled about by some sad political wreck again.
