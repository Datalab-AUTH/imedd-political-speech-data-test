This criterion determines where there will be residential buildings and how dense the buildings will be, whether there will be roads for traffic and mass evacuation in case of emergency, and of what dimensions, what flood protection works will be built, and whether there will be green spaces for recreation and sports facilities. The same criterion is used to determine the management of any open spaces and green spaces left. All governments to date have followed the same path on this issue. The guidelines are reflected in the Regulatory Plan for Athens and Attica, which was passed in 2014 and adopted by all: ND, PASOK, SYRIZA, who, after all, promoted it when they were in government. They are complicit in the policy that has targeted the remaining open spaces in Attica for exploitation by big capital. This is the path they are all taking, and they are all trying, especially SYRIZA and PASOK, to hide their agreement, ostensibly seeking more pro-peaceful conditions for the implementation of investments.
