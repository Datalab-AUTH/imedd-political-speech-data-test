We call on the thousands of people here in Nea Ionia who followed SYRIZA in previous years, for example, and perhaps other forces later on, to look the truth in the face, to think, and to see the enormous responsibility of SYRIZA for the victory of New Democracy in 2019 and last month on May 21. They should consider the damage that this party has done and continues to do to the working people's movement, to the consciences of working people, to the people as a whole, and damage to the cause of progress, that is, the struggle for a better life for all of us and our children. We look you in the eye as the communists have always looked you in the eye for more than 100 years, and we say to you, do not give them any more tolerance. Why? Tolerance ultimately means and becomes complicity because, unfortunately, they have chosen sides, and there is no hope of a return for the leadership of these parties.
