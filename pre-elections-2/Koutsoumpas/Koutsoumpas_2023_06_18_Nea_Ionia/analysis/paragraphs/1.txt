Dear friends, companions, and comrades, we cannot help but express our sorrow and anger at the new crime of this barbaric system, which has sent hundreds of persecuted people, including many children, to a watery grave in the Mediterranean. Now, four days after hearing this new inhuman news, the tears have dried up and turned into nothing but rage. This was also shouted by tens of thousands of mainly young people who took to the streets all over the country and here in Athens last Thursday. Anger against the system that generates poverty, exploitation, wars, and all the things that cause the uprooting of these people. Because refugee flows are not a natural phenomenon to be dealt with by inexpensive humanitarianism, let alone some proposals for managing the consequences.
