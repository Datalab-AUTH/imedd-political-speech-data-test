We are not choosing between the lesser evil of Syriza's Moria hellhole and the closed prison structures of the Southwest. We are not choosing the lesser evil based on who was in government during the shipwreck. We feel the same hurt and rage for everything. ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, all these parties of the system, of the EU and NATO, are accountable for this new crime. Our people must make it another voting criterion, among so many others, and give them what they deserve in the elections next Sunday. Especially here, in Nea Ionia, which was founded 100 years ago by refugees from Asia Minor. Its people know very well the struggle of refugees to put down roots and live in the region. Everything they achieved, they achieved through their struggle, even for the most basic things: water supply, electricity, schools for their children. It is due to their struggle and the pioneering attitude of the communists throughout time in the region that they managed to survive and not to various "saviors" or "messiahs".
