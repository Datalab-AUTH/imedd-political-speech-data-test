We warn everyone in the Southwest to be careful and not come with too much energy, as you will find it somewhere! You may have had an easy time for the past four years with SYRIZA and PASOK, who voted for 50% or 70% of your bills, but you did not find it easy to legitimize your unpopular laws in the minds of the people. You also did not find it easy when you tried to impose graveyard silence.
