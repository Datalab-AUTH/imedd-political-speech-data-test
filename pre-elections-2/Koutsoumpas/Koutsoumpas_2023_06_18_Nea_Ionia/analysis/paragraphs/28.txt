Comrades, friends, in the one week remaining, we will work day and night. Let's not count on any fatigue. We are now evaluating the results of the effort we have made over the past years, especially in the last few months, to strengthen the KKE. A first step was taken on May 21st, but it will remain in abeyance if it is not confirmed by the vote for the KKE next Sunday. In the end, that vote alone will count and will produce results that will follow us for at least the next 4 years. With ballot in hand, we are going to get everyone and everything, everyone. To ensure that not a single vote is lost to the JCP. To overcome all difficulties. Abstention will not be found by anyone's side in the years to come in the big hard times ahead. So no one should do a favor to those who want to corner them, who want them to form a Parliament with a convenient omnipotence of all the parties of this system, so that anti-people's emblematic bills with 250-270 deputies can be passed again, as has happened in many cases in all the previous years in the past four years. So, with anger, with heart, with mind, let us go to give all our strength to have great power, that is, to give strength to our strength. On June 25th, we will defeat the JCE. At this time, on this day, on the very next Sunday, let us all be on the war footing until the ballot box is closed, until the last ballot is cast. The red, red, red ballot paper must be cast in the ballot box of Nea Ionia, of the entire northern sector, of Attica, of all Greece. KKE strong, hope is here! Hello, thank you. Good strength!
