Friends, on the opposite side of the above is the Programme of the KKE. The superiority of the new socialist society on these issues is overwhelming. This is also evident from the historical experience of the first attempt to build socialism in the 20th century, despite the mistakes, weaknesses, and undoubted positives. The great cities of socialism were truly cities to live in. What was the key point? Social ownership of land and the concentrated means of production, scientific central planning of the economy, all services, worker-people control, and direct participation of the people. This is the road proposed today by the KKE as a real and definitive solution to the problems of the people.
