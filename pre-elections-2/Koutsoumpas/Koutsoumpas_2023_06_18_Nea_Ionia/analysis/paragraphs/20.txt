We answer them: Because the KKE has always been in front of you, always, everywhere in front, boldly, militantly, unwaveringly, to do the slogan: "Only the people save the people", on the road of radical subversion. It will do the same now and let SYRIZA or PASOK try to disarm our people by talking about the supposed omnipotence of New Democracy in order to scare them. We answer them: no government can feel omnipotent when the workers' and people's movement is strong. And in this country, there is a strong JCP, a guarantee that the people and their movement will be strong. Some people would do well to remember this because the map may now be painted blue, but somewhere, like here in Nea Ionia, this blue is fading because it projects a red, perhaps still a little faint but red, bright red. This is proof that a current of questioning the dominant policy, its class character, which is served by all the parties of capital and their various governments, is being strengthened. Proof that the search for a solution to today's problems is gaining strength through the organized struggle of participation in the movement, collective action looking ahead to the future. And they have no reason to vote again for New Democracy, for example, the popular people here who did so under blackmail, stability or instability, and under the influence of a disorienting confrontation of New Democracy with the other parties of the system. Because what will count for our people is not how many more deputies, for example, New Democracy will get to vote for its anti-people's bills, nor does it matter much how many more deputies PASOK or SYRIZA will get to follow this unpopular course.
