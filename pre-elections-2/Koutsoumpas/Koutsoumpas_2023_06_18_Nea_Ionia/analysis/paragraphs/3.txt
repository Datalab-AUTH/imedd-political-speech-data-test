Anger towards those who apparently did not do what was necessary to save innocent lives. They have the audacity to use the slave traders' refusal to save their goods, i.e. the people they had stowed away in that nutshell, as an excuse. Anger towards those who are once again spreading the poisons of racism, talking about illegal immigrants, invaders, or expressing annoyance even at the three-day mourning period that has been declared, revealing the darkness of their souls. No, we will not become accustomed to this recurring tragedy every three months, whether it be fires, floods, pandemics, trains, or the sea. Many more people now know it well: it is either their profits or people's lives. Everyone else is with their profits. We stand with people's lives.
