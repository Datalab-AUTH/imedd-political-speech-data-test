This is the direction that the laws of New Democracy serve for the environment and urban plans included in the recovery fund, which talk about the so-called "emblematic urban regeneration"! You have heard of this. This policy is being implemented as part of the EU's 'green transition' policy, the new big business of capital. Therefore, it is one more element of their common program, one more area in which objectively those parties that share this common program with each other cannot exercise real opposition to the next government of New Democracy.
