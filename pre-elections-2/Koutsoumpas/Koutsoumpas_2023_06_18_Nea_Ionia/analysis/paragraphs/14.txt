Throughout the past period, the KKE has been at the forefront of all major problems faced by working people, including those related to open spaces in the region. KKE deputies have been present, providing even more strength to these struggles. They have brought these issues to parliament, voted against them, and put as many obstacles as possible - based on the parliamentary power that the people had given them - to the plans of the government and other parties in the system. We will continue in this direction, even more vigorously in the coming period.
