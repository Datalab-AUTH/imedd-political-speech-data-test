We inform them that PASOK has not changed at all today. It is still the same party that betrayed the people's hopes, voted for three memoranda, and co-governed twice with New Democracy. Moreover, the day before the last elections, it declared its readiness to do it again. It is the party that associated itself with scandals and fraud, causing honest workers and the people to turn their backs on it. Its forces have caused and continue to cause the most damage within the trade union movement through cunning, goons, putting employers themselves in unions, and, above all, subordinating to the aims of capital. PASOK is the leadership of GSEE. The same GSEE that was basking in the sun and discussing investment products is now absent on the day when unions, workers, and federations are fighting the battle of the general nationwide strike after the crime in Tempe. But this is PASOK, and it is not changing.
