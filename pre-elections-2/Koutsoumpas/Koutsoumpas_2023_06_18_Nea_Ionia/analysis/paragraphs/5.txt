Friends, companions, and comrades, the criterion for voting in the upcoming elections must be each party's attitude towards satisfying the present and contemporary needs of the people and youth. The issue we have chosen to raise today is the struggle for the preservation and utilization of open spaces, which concerns one of these vital needs. Here, too, there is a wealth of experience regarding everyone's attitude and actions. Our motto is simple: open spaces for the people, closed to business interests! We are in a region where workers and youth have recent experience that shows this is also a matter of struggle and assertion. A typical example is the very place where we are now, next to Panetholio, one of the few remaining free spaces. Despite the problems of degradation and depreciation, it was still a "hive" for children and parents until two months ago when the playground was torn down without warning by the municipal authority, without any plan for what to do.
