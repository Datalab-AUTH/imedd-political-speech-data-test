We can succeed everywhere, and here in Attica, where our Party counted 12 deputies in the May elections, but also in all the constituencies that for the first time elect a KKE deputy. And I am talking about my homeland, Fthiotida, Trikala, Volos, Kozani, Chania, Messinia, Giannina, which of course are added to Achaia, Aetoloakarnania, Evia, Larissa, Heraklion, the two districts of Thessaloniki, which we had before. Not forgetting, of course, Lesvos, where our aim is to regain the seat. So we will fight the battle everywhere in all constituencies, because every vote counts, every vote counts, every vote adds to the electoral percentage of the party. See, for example, how the significant rise of the CKE in the single-member constituencies, especially on the Ionian islands, contributed to the overall electoral percentage. We therefore call on the 427,000 voters who trusted the JPC, many for the first time, to do so again.
