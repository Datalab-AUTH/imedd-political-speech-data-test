We answer them: No bourgeois government, no matter how many deputies it has, is omnipotent when there is a workers' - people's movement, when there is a strong KKE! And in this country there is a Communist Party of Greece, which in the May elections got 7.23%, and in the next elections it may become even stronger. And a strong KKE means a strong workers' movement, a strong people to put obstacles, to delay, and even to have conquests.
