-Who will be in front with the artists and intellectuals, the workers of spirit, art and life for the cultural uplift of the country, for the great transgressions? -Who will prevent even the reactionary changes that the New Democracy has in its plans, with a constitutional revision, for example for Article 16, when even during the election SYRIZA and PASOK are open to such a possibility?-Who will be on the front lines tomorrow in the struggle against the establishment of private universities and the further commercialization of health care and so many others?
