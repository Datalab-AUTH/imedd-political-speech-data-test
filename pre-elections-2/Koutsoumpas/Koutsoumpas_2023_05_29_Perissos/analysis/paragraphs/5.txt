Friends, comrades and comrades What the KKE said during the pre-election period, that the next government will be inherently unpopular, is now understood and accepted by most people.	Today the blackmailing dilemma "Mitsotakis or Tsipras", "South-West government or progressive government", has collapsed, along with the figures of SYRIZA which, as a political party, with its attitude both as a government and as an opposition, "washed out" the policy of the South-West and finally fed it with tens of thousands of votes.  Of course, this was never the real dilemma for the people. Because even if the notorious progressive "mufti" government, as we called it, were to emerge, it too would be unpopular by hand, would move with the same goals, would have the same commitments as the Southwest government.
