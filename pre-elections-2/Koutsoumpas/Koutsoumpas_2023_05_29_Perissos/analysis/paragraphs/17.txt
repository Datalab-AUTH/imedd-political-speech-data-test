Friends, comrades, what counts on 25 June is how strong the KKE, the only party that with consistency, stability and militancy can give a real militant opposition to the government of the South-West and the strategy it will implement, will emerge. It has proved it all the past years by its action in parliament and, above all, it has proved it together with the people and the youth in the streets of struggle. 	That is why now the KKE must become even stronger. Even by workers who did not take the step and can do so now.
