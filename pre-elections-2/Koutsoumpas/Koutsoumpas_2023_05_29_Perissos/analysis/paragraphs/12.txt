Let them leave that alone, they have made red carpets for ND and Mitsotakis and now they are whining about his supposed omnipotence. When of course they are not whining about ND's ratings, they are whining about the low ratings of the "Left". We tell them what the leftists, the progressive people who turned their backs on them and supported the KKE, tell them. The KKE fought the policies of the Mitsotakis government in practice and its forces do not add up to those who voted for dozens of its unpopular laws. Yes, those who broke the bans, in the name of the pandemic, do not add up to those who backed down and said that they would supposedly "answer for it later".
