The answer is self-evident for all: the KKE and its deputies will be there. The more these deputies are, the stronger the struggles that we all have to fight together will be. We have taken the step, think what will happen if we take the leap. Let's go for it. We can! So let's move forward with vigor. We are not complacent with what we have achieved. We know that many more people are now turning their eyes and their hopes to the JCE. We must live up to their expectations. So let us go on to fight this battle with realism and optimism. So that the KKE will be even stronger on 26 June. For the people to be stronger. JKE strong, hope is here!
