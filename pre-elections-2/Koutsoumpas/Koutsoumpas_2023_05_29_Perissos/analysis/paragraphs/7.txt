The government's "next day" programme includes the over 300 unpopular Recovery Fund preconditions, investment grade ratings, bloody surpluses and fiscal discipline based on EU commitments and the Stability Programme. These commitments are reminded by the Commission's Spring Report and expose the lies being peddled by ND and closely followed by SYRIZA and PASOK. They are committed to ensuring a prudent fiscal policy by limiting primary expenditure, for example in health, education and welfare. They are committed to implementing the unpopular reforms at a faster pace, to formulating an even more investor-friendly tax system, They are committed to reducing non-performing loans, with all that this means for the thousands of foreclosures. And of course they are committed to no seniority pay rise until 2027. In short, three-year terms are over!
