-Who will be tomorrow in the workplaces, in the factories, in the offices, in the companies, when the employers will demand more sacrifices, fighting for more collective agreements to be signed?-Who will be tomorrow in the neighbourhoods, when the people's families will be in danger of losing their homes to the crows of the funds and the banks? -Who will be against the government tomorrow when it asks for new sacrifices to burden the people with the burdens of a possible new crisis in order to save the business groups and the banks again?-Who will be against the new austerity tomorrow, the new cuts in social spending in education, health and welfare in the name of primary surpluses? Who will be there tomorrow at the agricultural blockades, next to the subsistence farmers, next to the self-employed professionals who will fight for their survival?
