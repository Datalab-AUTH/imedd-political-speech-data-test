Friends, compañeras and compañeros, From tonight the new election period begins. Tomorrow is the first day of the new election period. So, all of us, the parliamentary candidates, together with all the comrades and friends of the Party and the KKE in Attica and all over Greece, start the new electoral battle for the strengthening of the KKE with even greater optimism. And this optimism of course also stems from the fact that a positive step was taken in the May elections. The significant strengthening of the KKE, with a percentage of 7.23%, with 427,000 votes, 26 deputies, again winning third place in Attica, this time with double-digit percentages in the working-class - popular neighbourhoods, but also with an increase in all regions nationwide, is the optimistic message of these elections, without, of course, overlooking the overall negative correlation. On the contrary.  However, the rise of the KKE in votes and in percentages is the reason why thousands of workers, working class people, working class people, students and schoolchildren can smile today. Yes, the rise of the KKE is a ray of light in the darkness for every person who feels progressive, left-wing, regardless of whether or not they finally reached the ballot box with the KKE ballot paper.We meet many people every day who may not have voted for us, who may have made other choices, but they are happy because the KKE has been significantly strengthened. Imagine, we say to them, how you would feel if you had contributed to this strengthening. Do it now, let's make the KKE even stronger! And your joy will be doubled! We've taken one step, let's take the next one together.
