Today they have even more reasons to go back to the ballot box and cast the KKE ballot again. No vote should be lost because of abstention. All the necessary measures must be taken for this. We call on those who thought about voting KKE, but hesitated at the last minute, to do so now. There is no need to give so much power to ND, SYRIZA, PASOK. They don't need to scatter their votes to other smaller parties. Because what will count on June 25 is how strong the KKE will be, the only party that can consistently, consistently and militantly oppose the government of the South-West and the strategy it will implement. We can do it! Because today there is no longer the blackmailing dilemma of "stability or ungovernability". Of course, for us this dilemma never existed. We knew and we know that there is no way that parties with a common unpopular programme cannot form a government. They could do so in this Parliament that is currently being dissolved. But they want to plunder the votes of the working people - the people who did not "bite" their dilemmas and turned their backs on them. It is now obvious that the Southwest will form a government, probably an independent one, as it can achieve this even with a smaller percentage than the one it got on May 21.  It is up to us to make it difficult.
