Clean talk. Just as our words are clear about the "disposable parties", such as those now out of parliament. They are parties that are recruited, not all of them, to be used in various games within the bourgeois political system, and then with the same ease that they appeared they are withdrawn. They have nothing to offer the people, so no popular vote should be lost to these parties. Remember in the last 15 years we had LAOS, DIMAR, ANEL, POTAMI, UNITY OF CENTROS, MERA25, which entered parliament, trapped and seduced the people and then either returned to the bed of the main bourgeois parties, or gave their place to new shooting stars to give in turn a breath of help to the rotten system. No vote, therefore, should be wasted, scattered "right" and "left", but should fall, with even greater determination, only to the KKE!
