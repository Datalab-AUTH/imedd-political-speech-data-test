Our message is being spread everywhere these days, in every popular neighborhood and district. Through door-to-door outreach and word of mouth, it is reaching more people so that our movement can become even stronger. We can succeed with an even stronger KKE, with the KKE present in every neighborhood, especially in the popular neighborhoods of Thessaloniki. We have said it, friends: let Toumba, Kalamaria, and other working-class neighborhoods and districts turn red again. And indeed, we have taken the first step. The KKE has seen increased support, with thousands of new votes, placing third, second, and even first in many electoral districts throughout Greece. It has become the third party in Toumba! Now we must do it again, take the next steps, and make the leap with an even stronger KKE, the only genuine, popular, and militant opposition. Now there are more conditions for more people to take the decisive step, to overcome fears, hesitations, and prejudices more massively. More people should go all the way with the KKE ballot paper in hand and throw it determinedly into the ballot box. Because now, even during the election period, more experience has been gained. It has been proven to everyone what the KKE has always said: that the three parties have a common, unpopular program and that they agree on the basic, key, strategic issues.

Now they cannot blackmail in the same way they did during the last election period. The "government or no government" dilemmas or the "muff" dilemma of a "progressive" government have all collapsed since May 21.

Now everyone knows in practice, not in words, that every vote for the KKE serves directly, from the very next day, in the struggle. Within the last ten days, it has been demonstrated in every corner of Greece, from Kalamia in Kozani to the Shipbuilding and Repair Zone in Perama, and from there to the defence of the people's homes from the claws of the funds. The rise in numbers and votes of the KKE has strengthened and fed new struggles that broke out immediately after the elections. The deputies and candidates of the KKE were there where the people needed them, in the front line, bravely, alongside the people, the workers, the working class. This is the only real opposition that our people need and need.

Because there are now specific facts that everyone must take into account when going to the ballot box. The government program of the "next day," the new anti-people's government of the Southwest, is a given. It is clear and there is no room for misinterpretation. It has the signature of the Commission, the Recovery Fund, but also the American-NATO signatures. Their program includes everything that will make life even more difficult for the people. The firman from the EU talks about cutting spending and cutting even those meager mockery allowances, with whatever safety net they offered, to the very poor sections of the population; stopping subsidies on energy bills, which with the energy stock market will keep hitting red; freezing minimum wage increases due to seniority until at least 2029, living my May to eat clover, i.e., new taxes for the people to finance the investments of the few, because the tax base must be "broadened" as they say and at the same time there must be a tax system "more friendly" for investments, acceleration of auctions and other "reforms" such as the commercialization of education, the further commercialization of health care.

And not only that, but we also have commitments from the US-NATO that impose greater involvement of our country in the war in Ukraine, as well as acceleration of the settlement in the Aegean Sea with a plan similar to "Prespes". And here in Macedonia, you know very well what this means.

The results of the growth that the Southwest is promoting are a given, without any misinterpretation. It takes a lot of nerve, of course, to promote growth whose unit of measurement is now our dead. For years, all governments have imposed the rule of part-time employment to fill their pockets with profits. One-third of all workers now work part-time. For every 100 hires, we have 95 layoffs because the labor market is filled with 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 8-month contracts. A stable job is a pipe dream, especially for young people. For these few to record record increases in profits, the workers are recording record deaths and accidents at work. While people are laughing at the debate that is developing about the middle class, when the majority of Greeks have no more than 1,000 euros in savings. That is their growth. And already our people have paid dearly for it. That is why, friends, they need 'stability'. The stable continuation and implementation of all this is what the next ND government wants to ensure. This is why the KKE revealed from the very first moment that stability for capital means more instability and insecurity for the people.

But in the goal of achieving stability for capital, New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK come together, regardless of what they say or, rather, what they don't say. But be careful, they don't just mean a stable government. They want a stable opposition even more, ready and available at any time to assist in difficult times and provide crucial votes to save the system. At the same time, they want an opposition capable of encapsulating and integrating people who are disillusioned each time by the unpopular government. Capital needs a government that will implement its goals, but it also needs an opposition that is "consensual" and "systemic," an opposition that will "back down" on important and crucial issues and seek to secure the workers-people consensus in order to increase the profits of the few. Such an "opposition" has had and continues to have: Syriza and PASOK. These parties, which in the past four years voted for 50% and 70% of the laws of New Democracy, respectively, were calling for ministers in common with Mitsotakis. They valued social cohesion and called for submission and consensus at critical moments when our people were being tested and had to fight to save themselves!

But at the time when they were looking to determine the percentage of their agreement with Southwest, whether it be 50% or 70%, there was and still is a party that is 100% against it and its policies. A party that will exercise 100% popular, militant opposition! That party is the KKE.

With their policies and attitudes, both SYRIZA and PASOK gave enough time to the ND government and the rotten capitalist system to save themselves at the expense of the Greek people. They will do the same again because they agree with the strategic choices of capital and the EU. Not only that, but they have done something even worse. They have imposed, by their policies and attitudes, in the minds of many well-meaning, progressive people that there is no "alternative". They even pushed them to vote for New Democracy. Now, after decades of experience, neither PASOK nor SYRIZA have been able to give an answer from the point of view of the people's interests, either as a government or as an opposition. This was proven, moreover, by their governmental course when they passed memoranda one after the other, brought in new anti-people's measures, and co-governed with the Right: PASOK twice with ND, SYRIZA with ANEL, when known "right-wingers" easily joined their ballots, and when they supported all the directions of the EU, NATO, and so on. They proved it with the "composable" programs they submitted during the election, all serving the same strategic goals and their common choices. That is why, after all, the whole discussion before May 21 was about what composition and partnerships the next government could come up with, and not, of course, what it would implement and for whom. That is why PASOK was seen as available either with ND or with SYRIZA. And today it is again making itself available, based on statements by its executives, if ND fails to achieve self-reliance. And here we have another huge offer of SYRIZA to the system, one of many! It managed to rebrand PASOK as "progressive" with the well-known talk of a "progressive" government. The PASOK that was rightly spat upon by our people in 2012. The PASOK of the riot police, of the unpopular laws of "modernisation", of the bloody growth targets, of the euro and of the Olympiad that the people paid for in gold. The PASOK of memoranda, of cut wages and pensions, of the country's involvement in the war in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and so many others, of the surrender of Ocalan. It is this PASOK that SYRIZA has managed to baptize and re-launder as "progressive". Laundry contractor by Mr Tsipras and his party. SYRIZA and PASOK will, in fact, occupy the "opposition ministries" in the next unpopular government of ND.

See now, for a week they have been discussing - supposedly - taxation. They bring it here, they take it there. They mix up the numbers, they fudge the numbers, nobody understands in the end what they're saying. But they do not do it by accident. They want to hide their big deal on the basics. Who will pay all those taxes and who will be out of the loop? That's why none of them dare say and touch the two numbers that are the whole truth of their tax policy: 95 - 5. 95% of the taxes are paid by the people, 5% are paid by big business. That is why no one dares to say a peep about the 'voluntary' tax on shipowners. That is why none of them open their mouths to utter a single word about tax deferral on banks.

If they all cared about the people, especially the freelancers, they would support and vote for at least some of the proposals of the KKE in parliament. The KKE supports small and medium-sized self-employed individuals who are fighting, like everyone else, for the survival of their families. Especially in Toumba, in the 4th and 5th districts of Thessaloniki, areas that are still full of small shops and businesses struggling to survive against the state and big capitalist companies and chains. We call on every freelancer to learn about and listen to the proposals and demands put forward by the KKE because they are in their interest. The KKE is the only party fighting in and out of parliament for the imposition of a tax-free threshold of 12,000, the abolition of the business tax, the abolition of VAT on consumer goods, the abolition of the Special Consumption Tax and other fuel taxes, the introduction of a special maternity allowance for all self-employed women at the level of the basic wage for 8 months, and the freezing of individual insurance contributions for 2023. These were all proposals by the KKE in parliament, which the government as a whole and other parties rejected. Because the "strengths" of their economy can only accommodate a 300% increase in profits of listed companies and no relief for the people and small and medium self-employed. Therefore, the self-employed, together with the KKE and workers, must build a broad popular alliance, which will be expressed at the ballot box. Here is hope!

Many people were frightened about how to deal with a "all-powerful" Southwest. SYRIZA, in its desperation, is now saying "vote for me, at least so that the difference is not too big, so that there is an opponent's awe, so that there is an official opposition." Some well-meaning, gullible people are biting at that, too. Are they going to drive us crazy? In the last four years when the ND-SYRIZA gap was smaller and SYRIZA had 31%, did anything change? Have they at any time in the last few years been the "rival awe" of ND? On the contrary, they were at the most critical moments the best friend for ND. They played the role of the most effective fire extinguisher when needed.

This is what they did when popular anger at the management of the pandemic was fueled by the phrase "we'll deal with it later." This is what they did in response to popular sentiment for Greece's non-engagement in the war with Ukraine, legitimizing the Nazis of Azov with their presence in parliament. This is what they did when, faced with youth protests, they declared that there should be "prudence" and that young people should wait for the ballot boxes. We openly say to the people that if there is one thing they should be worried about, it is the negative correlation forming in parliament. With a broad consensus between ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK reaching 73%, as well as smaller parties ready to play the role of useful "porn" in the system whenever needed. Furthermore, this does not require an entire party, as it is enough to find the 1-2 MPs they need many times. People should also worry about the emergence of new parties that appear out of nowhere to grab their vote. Mrs. Konstantopoulou has also appeared out of nowhere as a new celebrity in the media, promoting her party as a supposedly anti-systemic force. However, since she also mentioned the presence of the KKE in Parliament, we reply to what we said yesterday here in Thessaloniki.

More than 600 questions and petitions regarding the problems faced by workers in this region were submitted by the two KKE MPs over the course of four years. However, whether a political force is considered antisystemic is not determined by its performance in Parliament or even by its ability to bring Nazi MPs to vote, but rather by its political proposals and attitudes, particularly outside of Parliament, towards the struggles of the people, from which this party is absent. If the KKE seeks more votes and deputies in the elections, it is because it intends to use this electoral power to strengthen the struggles of our people the following day. This is the criterion for determining who fights against the corrupt exploitative system and who, in their own way, serves it.

Of course, we are talking about parties that do not even have a program, so they talk nonsense, but they have leaders with a well-known and notorious past. Other parties, of course, have a program like this "Victory" one, but you shudder at what they write. They even talk about forced labor for those who cannot repay their loan obligations! It all sounds very Nazi, one might say.

But if there is one thing our people must be sure of, it is that there is a KKE here. And no correlation scares us! No correlation is invincible, as long as the KKE gets stronger. And now our people have a chance to take it even higher. To give strength to its power. To strengthen the only option that can really scare them: the KKE. Indeed, the people have a tough time ahead of them with the next unpopular government. That's why they need to think hard about who they trust to be by their side, every moment they need it, in the simple but crucial and important things that will happen in their lives. Who will they trust to be with them tomorrow in the workplaces, in the factories, in the offices, in the companies, when the employers will be asking for more sacrifices, fighting for more collective agreements to be signed? The KKE, its deputies, its trade unionists, and its ordinary members know that they will be with them and will not be with those who abolished the collective agreements and gave everything to the employers, as SYRIZA and PASOK did.

Really, who will be in the neighborhoods tomorrow when families are in danger of losing their homes to the claws of funds and banks? Can anyone trust those who passed laws that sold out people's homes to funds and turned popular mobilizations against auctions into private crimes? He knows for sure that the KKE and its deputies, trade unions, and the popular movement will be there.

Who will oppose the government tomorrow when it demands new sacrifices to burden the people with the weight of a possible new crisis in order to save the business groups and banks once again? Will it be SYRIZA or PASOK, who loaded the burdens of the previous crisis onto the people with their memorandums and are now exaggerating the Recovery Fund, the new ultramemorandum? Standing alongside the people will be the KKE, which has been fighting for some time to make capital pay instead of the people. Who will stand up tomorrow against the new austerity measures, the new cuts in social spending on education, health, and welfare in the name of primary surpluses? Of course, it will be the KKE, which stepped forward during the pandemic to protect the people's health.

Can our people entrust the fate of this struggle to PASOK, which closed hospitals from 2012 to 2015 together with New Democracy? Like here in your region with the Infectious Diseases Hospital? Or to SYRIZA, who continued the same policy, did nothing to reopen the hospitals, and even proposed a minister of common consent for health?

Who will prevent the reactionary changes that the Southwest has planned, such as a constitutional revision on Article 16? For example, students may trust the communists within universities who are fighting for free education with the "All Students" first force. Can we believe SYRIZA, who, through the words of Tsipras, left the possibility of establishing private universities open, as long as they are of the Harvard type?

And above all, who will be in front to open the way for the people themselves to become the protagonist of developments, to take power themselves with a clear pro-worker, pro-people programme, central scientific planning of the economy and services, with direct participation and worker-people's control in a new society to overthrow the present rot and barbarism? In this society for which the KKE is fighting, with the power-government programme it has, which envisages the people taking their fate in their own hands, not pinning their hopes on would-be "saviours". It provides for the socialization of the means of production and central planning for their utilization, for the utilization of the workforce. It provides for production to be set in motion with a view to satisfying social needs, with the aim of creating conditions in the workplaces and cities that correspond to the 21st century, as here in the city of Thessaloniki, in the Toumba area. You can get a glimpse of what kind of society the KKE is fighting for through its demands for your region.

Such as the demand for interventions to improve the situation, especially with regard to greenery and public infrastructure in the area of Toumba's Alana, new sports infrastructure, not privately owned, is needed to meet the needs for all sports. Expropriation and designation of land for building new schools, kindergartens, and nurseries should be prioritized. The construction of the kindergarten and daycare center, which is years overdue, should be prioritized. Civil protection infrastructure, flood protection with interventions in the streams and the Regional Ditch, earthquake protection, updating of emergency plans (including new interventions), and education of the population are necessary. The extension of the Metro to Toumba - 4th district and the adjacent areas of the Pylea district are also needed.

So we all know the answer. For all of this, the only party the people can trust is the KKE. In front will be the JKE. Its members, its cadres, its deputies, not a single one of whom must be lost! Because a vote for the KKE will become an immediate struggle and claim. Because a vote for the KKE will mean consistency and stability for the people. A vote for the KKE means a vote for our lives and not for their profits. A vote for the KKE translates into conflict, into disobedience to everything that makes us indignant. Voting for the KKE means, above all, hope and optimism that we will succeed. That the people will win. Now let's take the leap! Let no vote be lost! Let all the voters of the KKE get to the ballot box. So that not a single deputy won by the KKE for the people is lost. We can! So let's move forward with vigor. We are not complacent with what we have achieved. We say to those who are now turning their eyes and their hopes to the KKE.
