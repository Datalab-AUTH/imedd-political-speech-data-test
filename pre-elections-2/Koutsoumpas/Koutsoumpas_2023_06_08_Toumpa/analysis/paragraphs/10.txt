See now, for a week they have been discussing - supposedly - taxation. They bring it here, they take it there. They mix up the numbers, they fudge the numbers, nobody understands in the end what they're saying. But they do not do it by accident. They want to hide their big deal on the basics. Who will pay all those taxes and who will be out of the loop? That's why none of them dare say and touch the two numbers that are the whole truth of their tax policy: 95 - 5. 95% of the taxes are paid by the people, 5% are paid by big business. That is why no one dares to say a peep about the 'voluntary' tax on shipowners. That is why none of them open their mouths to utter a single word about tax deferral on banks.
