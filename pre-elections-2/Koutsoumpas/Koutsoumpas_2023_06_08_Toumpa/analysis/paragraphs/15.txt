Of course, we are talking about parties that do not even have a program, so they talk nonsense, but they have leaders with a well-known and notorious past. Other parties, of course, have a program like this "Victory" one, but you shudder at what they write. They even talk about forced labor for those who cannot repay their loan obligations! It all sounds very Nazi, one might say.
