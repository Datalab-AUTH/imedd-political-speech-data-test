Many people were frightened about how to deal with a "all-powerful" Southwest. SYRIZA, in its desperation, is now saying "vote for me, at least so that the difference is not too big, so that there is an opponent's awe, so that there is an official opposition." Some well-meaning, gullible people are biting at that, too. Are they going to drive us crazy? In the last four years when the ND-SYRIZA gap was smaller and SYRIZA had 31%, did anything change? Have they at any time in the last few years been the "rival awe" of ND? On the contrary, they were at the most critical moments the best friend for ND. They played the role of the most effective fire extinguisher when needed.
