Such as the demand for interventions to improve the situation, especially with regard to greenery and public infrastructure in the area of Toumba's Alana, new sports infrastructure, not privately owned, is needed to meet the needs for all sports. Expropriation and designation of land for building new schools, kindergartens, and nurseries should be prioritized. The construction of the kindergarten and daycare center, which is years overdue, should be prioritized. Civil protection infrastructure, flood protection with interventions in the streams and the Regional Ditch, earthquake protection, updating of emergency plans (including new interventions), and education of the population are necessary. The extension of the Metro to Toumba - 4th district and the adjacent areas of the Pylea district are also needed.
