This is what they did when popular anger at the management of the pandemic was fueled by the phrase "we'll deal with it later." This is what they did in response to popular sentiment for Greece's non-engagement in the war with Ukraine, legitimizing the Nazis of Azov with their presence in parliament. This is what they did when, faced with youth protests, they declared that there should be "prudence" and that young people should wait for the ballot boxes. We openly say to the people that if there is one thing they should be worried about, it is the negative correlation forming in parliament. With a broad consensus between ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK reaching 73%, as well as smaller parties ready to play the role of useful "porn" in the system whenever needed. Furthermore, this does not require an entire party, as it is enough to find the 1-2 MPs they need many times. People should also worry about the emergence of new parties that appear out of nowhere to grab their vote. Mrs. Konstantopoulou has also appeared out of nowhere as a new celebrity in the media, promoting her party as a supposedly anti-systemic force. However, since she also mentioned the presence of the KKE in Parliament, we reply to what we said yesterday here in Thessaloniki.
