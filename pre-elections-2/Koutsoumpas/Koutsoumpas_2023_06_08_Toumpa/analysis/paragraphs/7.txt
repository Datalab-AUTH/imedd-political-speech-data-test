But in the goal of achieving stability for capital, New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK come together, regardless of what they say or, rather, what they don't say. But be careful, they don't just mean a stable government. They want a stable opposition even more, ready and available at any time to assist in difficult times and provide crucial votes to save the system. At the same time, they want an opposition capable of encapsulating and integrating people who are disillusioned each time by the unpopular government. Capital needs a government that will implement its goals, but it also needs an opposition that is "consensual" and "systemic," an opposition that will "back down" on important and crucial issues and seek to secure the workers-people consensus in order to increase the profits of the few. Such an "opposition" has had and continues to have: Syriza and PASOK. These parties, which in the past four years voted for 50% and 70% of the laws of New Democracy, respectively, were calling for ministers in common with Mitsotakis. They valued social cohesion and called for submission and consensus at critical moments when our people were being tested and had to fight to save themselves!
