Our message is being spread everywhere these days, in every popular neighborhood and district. Through door-to-door outreach and word of mouth, it is reaching more people so that our movement can become even stronger. We can succeed with an even stronger KKE, with the KKE present in every neighborhood, especially in the popular neighborhoods of Thessaloniki. We have said it, friends: let Toumba, Kalamaria, and other working-class neighborhoods and districts turn red again. And indeed, we have taken the first step. The KKE has seen increased support, with thousands of new votes, placing third, second, and even first in many electoral districts throughout Greece. It has become the third party in Toumba! Now we must do it again, take the next steps, and make the leap with an even stronger KKE, the only genuine, popular, and militant opposition. Now there are more conditions for more people to take the decisive step, to overcome fears, hesitations, and prejudices more massively. More people should go all the way with the KKE ballot paper in hand and throw it determinedly into the ballot box. Because now, even during the election period, more experience has been gained. It has been proven to everyone what the KKE has always said: that the three parties have a common, unpopular program and that they agree on the basic, key, strategic issues.
