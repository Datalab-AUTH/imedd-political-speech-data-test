More than 600 questions and petitions regarding the problems faced by workers in this region were submitted by the two KKE MPs over the course of four years. However, whether a political force is considered antisystemic is not determined by its performance in Parliament or even by its ability to bring Nazi MPs to vote, but rather by its political proposals and attitudes, particularly outside of Parliament, towards the struggles of the people, from which this party is absent. If the KKE seeks more votes and deputies in the elections, it is because it intends to use this electoral power to strengthen the struggles of our people the following day. This is the criterion for determining who fights against the corrupt exploitative system and who, in their own way, serves it.
