So we all know the answer. For all of this, the only party the people can trust is the KKE. In front will be the JKE. Its members, its cadres, its deputies, not a single one of whom must be lost! Because a vote for the KKE will become an immediate struggle and claim. Because a vote for the KKE will mean consistency and stability for the people. A vote for the KKE means a vote for our lives and not for their profits. A vote for the KKE translates into conflict, into disobedience to everything that makes us indignant. Voting for the KKE means, above all, hope and optimism that we will succeed. That the people will win. Now let's take the leap! Let no vote be lost! Let all the voters of the KKE get to the ballot box. So that not a single deputy won by the KKE for the people is lost. We can! So let's move forward with vigor. We are not complacent with what we have achieved. We say to those who are now turning their eyes and their hopes to the KKE.
