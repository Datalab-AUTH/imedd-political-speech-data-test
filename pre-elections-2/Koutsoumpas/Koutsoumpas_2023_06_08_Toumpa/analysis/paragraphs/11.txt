If they all cared about the people, especially the freelancers, they would support and vote for at least some of the proposals of the KKE in parliament. The KKE supports small and medium-sized self-employed individuals who are fighting, like everyone else, for the survival of their families. Especially in Toumba, in the 4th and 5th districts of Thessaloniki, areas that are still full of small shops and businesses struggling to survive against the state and big capitalist companies and chains. We call on every freelancer to learn about and listen to the proposals and demands put forward by the KKE because they are in their interest. The KKE is the only party fighting in and out of parliament for the imposition of a tax-free threshold of 12,000, the abolition of the business tax, the abolition of VAT on consumer goods, the abolition of the Special Consumption Tax and other fuel taxes, the introduction of a special maternity allowance for all self-employed women at the level of the basic wage for 8 months, and the freezing of individual insurance contributions for 2023. These were all proposals by the KKE in parliament, which the government as a whole and other parties rejected. Because the "strengths" of their economy can only accommodate a 300% increase in profits of listed companies and no relief for the people and small and medium self-employed. Therefore, the self-employed, together with the KKE and workers, must build a broad popular alliance, which will be expressed at the ballot box. Here is hope!
