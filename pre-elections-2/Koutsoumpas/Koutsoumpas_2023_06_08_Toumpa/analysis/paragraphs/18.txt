Who will oppose the government tomorrow when it demands new sacrifices to burden the people with the weight of a possible new crisis in order to save the business groups and banks once again? Will it be SYRIZA or PASOK, who loaded the burdens of the previous crisis onto the people with their memorandums and are now exaggerating the Recovery Fund, the new ultramemorandum? Standing alongside the people will be the KKE, which has been fighting for some time to make capital pay instead of the people. Who will stand up tomorrow against the new austerity measures, the new cuts in social spending on education, health, and welfare in the name of primary surpluses? Of course, it will be the KKE, which stepped forward during the pandemic to protect the people's health.
