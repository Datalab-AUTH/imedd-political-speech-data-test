And above all, who will be in front to open the way for the people themselves to become the protagonist of developments, to take power themselves with a clear pro-worker, pro-people programme, central scientific planning of the economy and services, with direct participation and worker-people's control in a new society to overthrow the present rot and barbarism? In this society for which the KKE is fighting, with the power-government programme it has, which envisages the people taking their fate in their own hands, not pinning their hopes on would-be "saviours". It provides for the socialization of the means of production and central planning for their utilization, for the utilization of the workforce. It provides for production to be set in motion with a view to satisfying social needs, with the aim of creating conditions in the workplaces and cities that correspond to the 21st century, as here in the city of Thessaloniki, in the Toumba area. You can get a glimpse of what kind of society the KKE is fighting for through its demands for your region.
