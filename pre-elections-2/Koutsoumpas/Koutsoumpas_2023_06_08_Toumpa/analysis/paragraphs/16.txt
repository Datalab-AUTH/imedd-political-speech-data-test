But if there is one thing our people must be sure of, it is that there is a KKE here. And no correlation scares us! No correlation is invincible, as long as the KKE gets stronger. And now our people have a chance to take it even higher. To give strength to its power. To strengthen the only option that can really scare them: the KKE. Indeed, the people have a tough time ahead of them with the next unpopular government. That's why they need to think hard about who they trust to be by their side, every moment they need it, in the simple but crucial and important things that will happen in their lives. Who will they trust to be with them tomorrow in the workplaces, in the factories, in the offices, in the companies, when the employers will be asking for more sacrifices, fighting for more collective agreements to be signed? The KKE, its deputies, its trade unionists, and its ordinary members know that they will be with them and will not be with those who abolished the collective agreements and gave everything to the employers, as SYRIZA and PASOK did.
