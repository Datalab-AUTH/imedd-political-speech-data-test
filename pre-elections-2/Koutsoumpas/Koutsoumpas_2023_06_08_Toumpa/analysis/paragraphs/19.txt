Can our people entrust the fate of this struggle to PASOK, which closed hospitals from 2012 to 2015 together with New Democracy? Like here in your region with the Infectious Diseases Hospital? Or to SYRIZA, who continued the same policy, did nothing to reopen the hospitals, and even proposed a minister of common consent for health?
