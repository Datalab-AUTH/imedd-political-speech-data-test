Really, who will be in the neighborhoods tomorrow when families are in danger of losing their homes to the claws of funds and banks? Can anyone trust those who passed laws that sold out people's homes to funds and turned popular mobilizations against auctions into private crimes? He knows for sure that the KKE and its deputies, trade unions, and the popular movement will be there.
