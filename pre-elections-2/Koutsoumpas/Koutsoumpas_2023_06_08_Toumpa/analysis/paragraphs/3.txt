Now everyone knows in practice, not in words, that every vote for the KKE serves directly, from the very next day, in the struggle. Within the last ten days, it has been demonstrated in every corner of Greece, from Kalamia in Kozani to the Shipbuilding and Repair Zone in Perama, and from there to the defence of the people's homes from the claws of the funds. The rise in numbers and votes of the KKE has strengthened and fed new struggles that broke out immediately after the elections. The deputies and candidates of the KKE were there where the people needed them, in the front line, bravely, alongside the people, the workers, the working class. This is the only real opposition that our people need and need.
