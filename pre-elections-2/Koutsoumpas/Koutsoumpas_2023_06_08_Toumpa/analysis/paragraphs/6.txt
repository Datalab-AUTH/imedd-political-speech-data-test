The results of the growth that the Southwest is promoting are a given, without any misinterpretation. It takes a lot of nerve, of course, to promote growth whose unit of measurement is now our dead. For years, all governments have imposed the rule of part-time employment to fill their pockets with profits. One-third of all workers now work part-time. For every 100 hires, we have 95 layoffs because the labor market is filled with 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 8-month contracts. A stable job is a pipe dream, especially for young people. For these few to record record increases in profits, the workers are recording record deaths and accidents at work. While people are laughing at the debate that is developing about the middle class, when the majority of Greeks have no more than 1,000 euros in savings. That is their growth. And already our people have paid dearly for it. That is why, friends, they need 'stability'. The stable continuation and implementation of all this is what the next ND government wants to ensure. This is why the KKE revealed from the very first moment that stability for capital means more instability and insecurity for the people.
