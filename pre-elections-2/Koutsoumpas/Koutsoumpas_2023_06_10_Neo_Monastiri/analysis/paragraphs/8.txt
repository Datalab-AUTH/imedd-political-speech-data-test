Only in the last few days, we have managed to cancel dozens of auctions and evictions from the homes of workers who cannot pay the banks and tax authorities, and who are at risk of having their homes confiscated and being evicted. We have also helped shopkeepers who are in debt due to the constant burden of paying taxes and other issues. Through the mobilization of other Workers' Party MPs, we have successfully cancelled these auctions and arranged favorable solutions.
