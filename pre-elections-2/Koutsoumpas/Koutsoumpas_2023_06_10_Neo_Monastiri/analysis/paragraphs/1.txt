First of all, I want to thank you for the warm welcome and wish you all good strength and good health, as we have a difficult time ahead of us. Unfortunately, the hard times are not over as some people promised us. We will face difficulties, but we are all here together as one to confront them. A united people, a strong people, and a stronger JCP can truly work wonders.
