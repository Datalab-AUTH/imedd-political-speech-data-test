That is why we call on those of you who have done it before, who have voted for the KKE, whether here in the new monastery, in the province of Domokou, in Fthiotida or elsewhere, to do it again. Don't neglect to go, especially the youth. Don't say, "Where should I go to vote again now?" because the problem of abstention exists. Everyone should go and vote, and those who hesitated or thought about it but did not vote in the last election should do it now.
