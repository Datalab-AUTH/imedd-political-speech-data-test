And you know that 95% of both direct and indirect taxes are paid out of pocket by the Greek working people. It is not paid by the wealthy individuals. The wealthy only pay 5%. In other words, those who have millions and billions and do not know what they have in Greece and abroad pay only 5%. There are tax breaks for shipowners. SYRIZA, New Democracy, and PASOK have given 50 tax breaks to shipowners. There are tax breaks for the shipowner, industrialist, and banker, but none for the working people or farmers.
