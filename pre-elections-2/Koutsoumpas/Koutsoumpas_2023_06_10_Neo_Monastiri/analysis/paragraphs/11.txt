We now have arable land throughout Greece, including this region where they are planting photovoltaics. We are not saying not to use the sun, as Greece has plenty of it. Of course, renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics and wind turbines should be utilized. But where? Where will these wind farms be built? You cannot destroy crops or forests haphazardly, as it benefits private investors who want to make more profit by building roads in the forest, cutting down trees, and installing these structures. Wind turbines, for example, have a lifespan of 20 years. What happens to the carcass after that? It must be torn down, which involves a significant amount of cement and other materials. Wires are installed, roads are built, and destruction occurs, all for no benefit. Cheap electricity is not available to families simply because we have wind turbines and photovoltaics.
