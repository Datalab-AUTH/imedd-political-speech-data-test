Anyway, that is not the end of this story or this conversation. It only begins now. We are saying that the 26 Members of Parliament given to us by the Greek people, who gave us an electoral system that was fairer than the previous one, must be kept and increased. This means that, on the basis of this electoral law, both the votes and the percentages must be increased so that we can get these Members of Parliament. Otherwise, the first party gets a bonus and steals from us. That means that with the same percentage, if we get the 427,000 votes, that is to say, that we got nationwide, it can steal from us the bonus that it gets around 5 MPs and we can get 20, 21, 19 depending... And you understand that that is going to be negative for the people themselves. It is not going to be for the party. We, with 15 MPs and with 20 and with 25 and with 30 in the front line of the struggle, will be in the Parliament and outside the Parliament to defend the interests of the people. We will do everything in our power to do so. But when we are stronger, you will feel stronger yourselves. That is, the people themselves will become stronger if the KKE becomes stronger.
