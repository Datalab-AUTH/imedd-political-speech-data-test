To say that I will give a vote to KKE, so that I can have a representative in Fthiotida, so that they have more representatives, so that I can have them next to me tomorrow, and we know that what we promise, we do it now, looking you in the eye. We do not say one thing in Parliament, another thing in the office, and another thing at demonstrations and mobilizations. We are straightforward and honest about these things. So, thank you.
