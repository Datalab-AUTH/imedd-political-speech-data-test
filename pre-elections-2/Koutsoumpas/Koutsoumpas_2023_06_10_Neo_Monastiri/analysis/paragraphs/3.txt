And I wanted to address you here, especially because the elections on June 25th are being held under a very unfair, I would say predatory electoral law. In the previous elections on May 21st, we elected a deputy in Fthiotida after many years. We can do it again, only because the electoral law is unfair and the first party. That's why Mitsotakis is redoing the election, not because he couldn't find 5 MPs he was missing to make a majority or to make a partnership with another party. It's to steal votes, to have self-reliance, to have a strong government, and to basically do what he wants in the parliament. Because a majority can pass unpopular measures, pass laws without resistance, without reaction. Of course, it has support from the other parties. Unfortunately, in the past four years, SYRIZA, for example, which was the official opposition, voted for half of the bills that were not good, they were unpopular, 200 bills in number that the New Democracy government passed. PASOK voted for 70% of the bills, even more than Syriza. That's why we say that they can find common programs and not plague the people, the country, and the economy and drag us into successive elections. They could agree on another 200.
