And to address a number of issues together, of course, with the struggle that we have to undertake, because the struggle is not only in the House. So, what are you voting for? What bills and amendments are you making? What proposals are you making? The struggle is out there, and mostly it's out there in the day-to-day struggles, in the pressure that's going on. You saw what they accomplished in a number of places. The day before yesterday, they succeeded with the 48-hour strike in the shipbuilding zone in the shipyard in Praga because they had one dead and two crippled workers again. They succeeded in making the collective agreement compulsory, which the workers had signed in 2017 with the support of the KKE. And they did not recognize it as compulsory in 2017, neither the SYRIZA government that was until 2019, nor after four years the government of the New Democracy. And now, with the 48-hour strike and what happened, they have to mourn another dead worker there; it became compulsory. They did it, but it was the KKE there. It was workers' unions that showed solidarity with them, it was their own struggle, it was the communist deputies who were there.
