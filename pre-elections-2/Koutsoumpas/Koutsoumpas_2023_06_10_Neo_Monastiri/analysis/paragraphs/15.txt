They are squeezing us and they say, now: we will find 5-7 companies that have excess profits and we will tax them and Mitsotakis and Tsipras and Androulakis are saying this. Which ones will you tax? They are saying 5-7 companies for excess profits and to leave out the 150 companies listed on the stock exchange, which had a 303% increase in profits last year alone. We are talking about billions of euros, that is profits. And the workers in these companies or society in general do not enjoy anything from these billions of the 150 main shareholders and not only that, but the shareholders, the dividends of the shareholders in these companies cut taxes more. Remember it was 15 the tax rate, 15% tax on the shares in the companies on the stock exchange, these big ones. And then Syriza, they made it 10%, don't upset the big industries, the big shareholders. He lowered it. Then the new democracy in turn makes it 5%. It's 5% now. Let them pay and we don't know what they pay.
