We are not saying that Greece doesn't have productive potential or wealth. The question is how it is exploited, who has the power, who owns the property, and whose interests are being served. If every elected government and the parties they represent serve the few - the bankers, shipowners, and industrialists - the result is a decline in the working people's standard of living. Promises are made, but where is the tax-free threshold for professionals? Our proposal and others in the House were not voted for, but with more power, we could have forced it through. We propose a tax-free threshold of 12,000 for both farmers and professionals, increasing for each child in the family, and it should be tax-free now so that the man doesn't pay.
