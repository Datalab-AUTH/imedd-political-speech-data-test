Because we have a place, a homeland, and a region here, especially Fthiotida, which is very rich with enormous productive potential that unfortunately is not being exploited. They are not exploited for the benefit of the people, the workers, the farmers, the professionals, the youth, and the pensioners who have worked all their lives and finally want to enjoy the years of the rest of their lives. You see pensions being constantly reduced, and the benefits of the ESAS being cut one after the other repeatedly by all governments.
