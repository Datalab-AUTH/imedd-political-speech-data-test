Other sources of energy are not being exploited. For example, they have installed wind turbines and photovoltaics to invest in renewable and green energy, but they have neglected hydroelectricity. Greece has many rivers, lakes, and abundant water resources that could be used for hydroelectric projects. This would make electricity cheaper and more accessible, reducing energy poverty. Additionally, Greece has an important geothermal field due to its seismic activity, with five thermal springs in Fthiotida alone. However, these resources are not being utilized for thermal tourism or to benefit local communities. Geothermal energy could be harnessed to power homes and agricultural production in areas such as Kamena Vourla, the plain of Spercheios, Platystomo, Hypati, Kaitsa, Thermopylae, and Istria. Geothermal energy is an important and viable source of energy.
