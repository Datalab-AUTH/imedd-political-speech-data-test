And other domestic energy sources are not being exploited. They took this wealth that we have, the lignite, and they destroyed it. They shut down plants. We are now stuck with natural gas, which would be cheaper. We warned them because the rivalries are great. NATO and Russia are now fighting in Ukraine, and you saw what happened there. Gas prices went up and they stopped. There was an embargo on Russia by NATO countries, European countries, and the Americans. Greece is also involved in this conflict. We went back to lignite again. Lignite is both a cheap medium and can be exploited. We have ready labor, technical manpower, and infrastructure, including factories in Ptolemaida. Lignite is available in large quantities and can be exploited by taking measures to protect the environment. This is the twenty-first century. Science has reached great heights, so we can technologically solve and protect the environment.
