Friends and comrades, We are once again in Thessaloniki to fight with even greater optimism in the new electoral battle for the strengthening of the KKE. A positive step was taken in the May elections, despite the negative correlation that remains. Now we are preparing for the next ones. We know that the strengthening of the KKE was the only element of the election result that made many people smile, even those who did not vote for it in the end. We urge them to do so now, so that we can all smile together. We must cut off the smiles of those who dream of "all-powerful" governments that will crush working people, or those who foster such fears to blackmail people at the ballot box again. We need an even stronger KKE for 100% militant, popular opposition to the unpopular policies of the New Democracy government and the consensus that everyone else will give it. This is what will count for the people in the face of the hardships they are preparing for the next day. That is why we say: on June 25th, a strong KKE, because hope is only here! The significant rise of the KKE in the Region of Central Macedonia, in all its electoral districts, in all urban centers and villages, fills us with optimism because it proves the growth of the Party's prestige among the people. It shows that the vote for the KKE is a conscious choice of thousands of people who have joined the communists in recent years on all fronts of struggle for the defense of the rights of the people and youth, against the policies that are crushing their lives. The emergence of the KKE as the third party in the popular neighborhoods, in the third and fourth districts of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, reflects the ties that have developed over the last few years through the struggles and diverse other actions where communists have taken the lead.

In the struggles of the working class in a number of workplaces for the repulsion of the employer's attack, such as in Malamatina, Food, Metal, Construction, Telecommunications, Food-Tourism, and elsewhere.

In the struggle to prevent auctions and evictions of working-class families, in the struggle against the involvement of our country in NATO plans, and in the struggle against the transformation of Thessaloniki into a base of death.

The KKE has elected two deputies in Thessaloniki: Yannis Delis in the 1st district and Leonidas Stoltidis in the 2nd district. Over the past four years, they have been at the forefront of the struggles of the people and youth in the region. Together, they have fought to defend the rights of the people in every aspect of their lives, including labor, income, the environment, health, education, and the defense of people's housing from the banks and funds. From 2019 to 2023, the KKE submitted over 600 questions, topical questions, and reports to Parliament regarding the problems faced by the people in Thessaloniki and Central Macedonia in general.

The KKE ensured that the demands of workers in the region for payment of wages, benefits, and bonuses at places such as the former supermarket "Karpidis", "Express Service", the spinning mill "Varvaressos", private schools, ELVO, OASΘ, and MLS were presented in Parliament. They also advocated for the signing of a Collective Labour Agreement in SIDENOR and the reinstatement of dismissed workers who were trade unionists, such as those from the Union of Mine and Quarry Workers of Northern Greece and the Union of Contract Workers of the University of Thessaloniki, as well as those affected by mass dismissals in "Malamatina" and "Hellenic Gold". They also addressed labor accidents, such as the fall of an OTE aerial cable in the municipality of Lagada and accidents at metro construction sites.

The KKE deputies fought together with the people of the region to stop the burning of carcinogenic fuels at TITAN SA, to address the stench in the area of the municipality of Cordelios-Evosmos caused by the industrial activity of HELPE, to combat the pollution of Lake Koronia, to protect areas of Central Macedonia from flooding, to oppose the sale and privatization of the marina Aretsous in Kalamaria, and to redesign fire protection in Eastern Thessaloniki based on the needs generated by the area's population growth.

To increase funding and recruit all necessary staff in hospitals and health centers for the reopening of all ICUs in hospitals in the region, for the staffing of the neonatal intensive care unit at Hippokratio, for the staffing and transfer of the day care unit at Theagenio. But also for the problems of the employees in EODY, KETHEA, and Okanas. And of course, we brought the issue of staffing the ambulance to Parliament with immediate recruitment of drivers and rescuers who, if they had been hired, might have saved the lives of the woman in Kos and the young girl in Nea Makri. How cynical and unacceptable are Pleyris' statements that we cannot have public health structures all year round on an island because it is filled with tourists in the summer? They want tourism and profits all year round, but the health of the people is a 'cost' to them. How timely is the slogan 'their profits or our lives'.

The KKE deputies fought alongside them and highlighted the problems and demands of pupils, students, and learners. They demanded that the degrees of EPAS-OAED students not be degraded, that their schools be equipped, and that their suspension period's work tickets be honored. They also demanded that PASTER IEKs students be given practical training without additional burden. Lastly, they demanded that IPEE students be given internships at Hippocrates and Papageorgiou Hospitals with full wage, insurance, and labor rights.

This was the work of the KKE MPs from Thessaloniki in Parliament, while the MPs from other parties were busy voting for one unpopular bill after another. You know very well what the work of the KKE MPs was outside of Parliament as well, because you saw them every day by your side. That is why we say that the working people of Thessaloniki have an absolute interest in sending not only these two KKE deputies to the new Parliament, but also more. For example, the people of the first part of Thessaloniki do not need the nine ND deputies elected on May 21, who could become more now with the unacceptable bonus that steals seats from other parties. They do not even need the 4 SYRIZA MPs. They need more communist, militant deputies from the KKE. We therefore call on those who trusted the KKE, many for the first time, to do so again. Because now they have more reason to do so. Let no vote be lost due to abstention. We call on those who thought about voting for the KKE but hesitated at the last moment to do it now. So that we are all stronger together on June 26 to continue to fight the battle for the interests of the "many".

Friends, companions, and comrades, what the KKE said during the pre-election, that the next government will be unpopular, is now understood by more people. The only question that exists today is who can form a real opposition to the government of the South-West. We have already revealed to the people that hard times are ahead. The government's "next day" program is concrete: it is a return to "bloody" primary surpluses from this year, with a "plunge" of direct and indirect taxes. It is the more than 350 unpopular preconditions and "reforms" for the Recovery Fund super-memorandum to put in place over €32 billion for business groups to make profitable investments.

This is the most significant promotion of the "green transition" strategy, which for people means more expensive electricity, goods, housing, and transportation.

It is the commitment to not proceed with any pay rise for seniority until 2027, as revealed in the Commission's spring report, that none of them dare to challenge. In short, the three-year terms are over.

They are also committed to NATO and the United States, involving our country in the war in Ukraine, as well as other dangerous plans that extend to settlements in Greek-Turkish relations with NATO's approval and much more.

This is, in a nutshell, the "stability" that the next government of the Southwest promises to ensure: stability for capital, of course, but which means more instability and insecurity for the people. But in the goal of this stability for capital, both ND and SYRIZA and PASOK meet. As much as capital needs a government that will implement its goals, it also needs a "consensual", "systemic" opposition that will "back down" on the difficult, important, and critical issues in order to increase the profits of the few. And such a "muff" opposition existed and still exists: SYRIZA and PASOK, along with other small parties, are satellites of the others. SYRIZA and PASOK implemented the same policy as governments, passing memoranda and hundreds of implementing laws. They supported the same policy as the "opposition", backing all the strategic choices of capital. In the four previous years, they voted for 50% and 70% of the laws of the ND, respectively, and called for ministers of common consent with the ND. It is this policy that leads to the disillusionment of the people. This is the policy that brought the ND in 2019, this is the policy that led to its great victory in the last elections, as the alleged lesser evil. Besides, the stumbling blocks that these parties put in the effort for massification, for the development of the labor movement and workers' struggles are well known. What should we remember? What Syriza used to say, such as "we'll settle accounts later," when workplaces were full of coronavirus because of the lack of protection measures against employers and the concealment of cases? That he was saying that "strikes against the Hatzidakis abomination will not work," only to go on to vote for half? The collusion between PASOK, ND, SYRIZA to form a presidency in the GSEE? The formation of a "functional" presidium in the ECT by the same forces, leaving out the forces that support the KKE, which is the 2nd force, because they know that they will spoil the soup of consensus and social cohesion? You see SYRIZA and Mr. Tsipras care about who governs at all levels, he is not indifferent, as he dared to say about the KKE the other day here in Northern Greece. That is why he is 'fighting' the right with Antonaris, Marantzidis, and other such fiddlers. That is why in Patras he is allied with ND and PASOK against the communist mayor, Kostas Peletidis. That is why in Peristeri he supports the mayor of the Southwest, Pachaturidis. That's why in Kaisariani he has a common candidate with ND and PASOK to prevent the election of a communist mayor. You would think that not only does he care, but he did his best to get Mitsotakis' ND to rule again. So let him not wag his finger at the KKE. Not only do we care, but we will be the only ones who will fight against the next unpopular government of ND. Friends, in the question of their profits or our lives, ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, and the other wildcard parties choose profits. That is why they cannot give real opposition to each other. This is the law they serve and advertise in their programs.

This law characterizes wages and insurance as costs, despite the fact that no good or service can be produced without the work of those who receive them. The same law considers life and health protection measures to be costs, and has recently broken up 57 families in Tempe, been responsible for dozens of employer crimes in various sectors and workplaces, and has wiped out working-class families. With this law, the 150 business groups recorded over 10 billion euros in profits in 2022, an increase of over 300%. And what is the condition for all this? A minimum wage that has remained the same since 2012, 11 years ago, and an average wage that is 25% lower than in 2011. People pay 95% of direct and indirect taxes, while big business groups pay only 5%, and this has been the case for a long time. It takes a lot of nerve to pretend that they have different approaches to taxation when neither of them has changed that ratio. What else is a prerequisite for their profits? One in two new jobs are part-time or rotational, with an average net salary of just over €300 per month. 6,000 workers lose their jobs every day and are recycled between unemployment and job insecurity, and this is the reality for workers in Central Macedonia and in the mines in the region. On the one hand, there is 680 million euros in funding for the Skouries project, and the ores are sold at record prices. On the other hand, there are extreme work intensification conditions and collective dismissals at the project by contractors.

The same goes for young men who work in Halkidiki during the season. There are investments reaching 150 million euros for large hotel units, with profitable parties for the big players in the industry who are expecting record numbers this year. There are also more than 10 different forms of employment, with nominal wages at the 2007 level for employees. Therefore, especially for young people working in the season, do not hesitate! Overcome the obstacles put up by those who have rejected the proposals of the KKE to make it easier for them to exercise their rights and support the KKE. The communists in parliament and outside in the streets of the struggle are fighting against the miserable working conditions of food and tourism workers.

The young man and woman who work in the food service industry on minimum wage cannot blame their bad luck. Those who decided that the minimum wage should be set by the government of the day, and that this should be based on the criterion of boosting the competitiveness of businesses, are to blame. This law has a name, in fact, it has two names: it is called the Vroutsis-Achitsioglu law. The first brought it, the second activated it. The trade employee who does not know what time she will get off work is not to blame for supposedly 'not organizing her schedule well'. The laws of the New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK took off the arrangement of working hours, they ripped up the Sunday holiday. Public sector workers do not have a 13th and 14th salary, not because they are full of money. Those who governed are responsible because they 'forgot' years ago to restore the gifts that were cut off and even recently rejected the amendment we tabled. The fact that we have had a 49% reduction in regular staff at EYATH in recent years is due to the commercialization policy followed by all governments and is also a prerequisite of the recovery fund that the other parties are worshipping. The fact that the workplaces have become a vast valley of Tempe has the stamp of the ND, SYRIZA, PASOK. The tragic lack of safety measures and non-existent controls 'go hand in hand' with intensification, rubber-neck work, generalized labor exploitation, and the increased retirement age. All of this puts workers in increasing danger to their own lives. This is the reason why we count one worker dead every three days. In this three-year period alone, workers in the municipality of Thessaloniki have had 120 accidents at work.

Friends, comrades, and companions, in the past period, peoples in several countries have mobilized and gone on nationwide strikes. Similarly, in our country, the past years have been marked by major strike mobilizations in sectors and workplaces. And if one conclusion can be drawn, it is that no bourgeois government, no matter how many deputies it has, is omnipotent when there is a workers' and people's movement, when there is a strong KKE! A strong KKE means a strong workers' movement, strong people to put obstacles, to delay, to have conquests, as we have done so far. With the magnificent mobilizations and strikes in March, with the basic demand that the responsibilities for the crime of Tempe should not be covered up. The thousands of young mouths chanting 'PASOK-Syrizas-New Democracy, this crime has a history' record a dynamic that must not be broken. On the contrary, it must grow stronger, spread out, and become an organized current of assertion. And the impetus for this can only be given by a much stronger KKE in the June elections.

With the struggles for the protection of people's health, together with struggles for wages, collective agreements, and the right to work, health workers, LARCO, COSCO, E-food, Malamatina, Varvaressos, Kavala's oil and fertilizer workers, construction workers, miners, and workers from other branches and workplaces became protagonists. They struggled to prevent workplaces from becoming "special economic zones" without rights and safety measures for workers, with laws that Adonis Georgiades voted for, which SYRIZA also supported. As a result, we are mourning one dead and two crippled workers in the Perama Zone. It is significant that a large part of the Shipbuilding Collective Labour Agreement, which the union managed to sign after struggles in 2017, relates to health and safety measures. The previous Syriza government and the next ND government did not make this CBA compulsory, but the workers made it compulsory with their struggle after the new employer crime, as it is one step before their collective agreement has the force of law for all companies. We are proud that in these and so many other struggles, the KKE and its deputies were in front.

The corrected text = The KKE is not waiting for the elections to start the militant opposition. They are already on the streets every day, even where people's houses are being auctioned off. We managed to cancel 10 auctions last week alone.

We are proud because, with the contribution of the communists, workers in many workplaces did not relegate their just demands to the second presence of the expectation of governmental changes and fought the battle in tough confrontation with the employers and the laws that support them. They did not put up with the false big talk of more capitalist investment as a solution to their problems. They did not step on the banana peel for struggles at the limits of the economy's endurance, namely the profits of the business groups. They did not see the workers' bargaining with the employers over how much less we will lose as a solution, as the leadership of the GSEE and ADEDY calls for. We all together, with a strong KKE and mass struggles, can impose our rights, the abolition of all the anti-worker laws of the ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK on Collective Labour Agreements and wages. The restoration of collective bargaining by adopting the demands of the trade unions for increases above €850 and at the same time the restoration of triennial wages. This practically means that a worker with a three-year contract will see their salary increase to €935 today, not in 2027 as promised by ND, although this became a summer dream after the Commission's recommendations. This proposal is linked to the other proposals of the KKE for a fixed daily working time, 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours, and no unpaid overtime, with the restoration of Sunday holidays. It is linked to the proposal for an inflation-based wage adjustment clause. With the restoration of the 13th and 14th salaries in the public sector, about which the South West, PASOK, and SYRIZA say nothing, and the granting of all salary scales. With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles, we can impose the restoration of the sectoral collective labour agreements and their compulsory nature without terms and conditions, which is a basic condition for increasing wages in all scales. This is the only pro-people's answer.

Friends, companions, and comrades, only together with the KKE can we make a difference. It knows how to confront the governments, the ruling class, and their anti-people policies. We must multiply pockets of resistance and unite in a nationwide movement of questioning and conflict. We can save people's homes and small businesses from the funds and the "vultures" who exploit the laws of ND, PASOK, and SYRIZA to carry out new evictions. We can fight for collective labor agreements with wage increases and measures to protect workers' lives, against the legislative arsenal of the ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK governments that protect the profits of employers.

We can fight against the deterioration of the conditions of education for children from families of the people, and against further privatization of education at all levels.

We can fight against imperialist wars and Greece's involvement in US-NATO plans, which New Democracy, PASOK, and SYRIZA all agree with.

We keep hope alive by strengthening collective struggles against compromise and disillusionment cultivated by the forces of social democracy, thus also feeding New Democracy. Only together with the KKE can we create cracks in the negative correlation. Everything changes when the many decide with their actions! You know where the KKE will be the next day, unlike ghost parties that "noisily" appear and "quietly" withdraw when they have completed their mission on behalf of the system. There is no time to waste. Much less do we have votes to lose, such as those of the so-called small parties, the "disposable parties", such as those now out of parliament. They are parties that are recruited to be used in various games within the bourgeois political system, and then with the same ease that they appeared, they are withdrawn. Like now, the Hellenic Solution, where the leader of this party is tried and tested against popular interests. MP for LAOS when the government of ND, PASOK, LAOS brought in the 2nd memorandum. Member of ND when the government of ND, PASOK, DIMAR was implementing it. Just so we don't forget.

Remember that in the last 15 years we have had LAOS, DIMAR, ANEL, POTAMI, CENTRIST UNION, MERA25, all of whom entered parliament, deceived and seduced the people, especially young people, giving a breath of life to the rotten system. These parties are so "young" that they propose radical measures for the working people, such as NIKI, which proposes forced labor with increased deductions for those who owe loans. In other words, slave labor so that the banks do not lose a single euro.

No vote, therefore, should be "let's go and wherever it comes out", but should fall, with even greater determination, only to the KKE! For another important reason. Because it is the only party that has a power-governance program with the workers at the helm of power, real owners of the wealth produced. Because the KKE does not see workers as dots, nor does it divide them into green, blue, and pink. That's why they don't say "good riddance" because they voted for one party or the other, as others do. They are flesh and blood, and they see them as the class that produces all the wealth around us and that has the power, when it decides to do so, to turn it all upside down. For in the present barbarism, there is a way out for the interests of the people in the conflict and overthrow of the rotten, corrupt system. Let us go to make the KKE even stronger, therefore, so that the people can be strong against the next anti-people's government, so that the prospect of the better days we want to live and will live can be strengthened. Only the people can save the people, on the road to overthrow with a strong KKE!
