Friends, companions, and comrades, only together with the KKE can we make a difference. It knows how to confront the governments, the ruling class, and their anti-people policies. We must multiply pockets of resistance and unite in a nationwide movement of questioning and conflict. We can save people's homes and small businesses from the funds and the "vultures" who exploit the laws of ND, PASOK, and SYRIZA to carry out new evictions. We can fight for collective labor agreements with wage increases and measures to protect workers' lives, against the legislative arsenal of the ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK governments that protect the profits of employers.
