With the struggles for the protection of people's health, together with struggles for wages, collective agreements, and the right to work, health workers, LARCO, COSCO, E-food, Malamatina, Varvaressos, Kavala's oil and fertilizer workers, construction workers, miners, and workers from other branches and workplaces became protagonists. They struggled to prevent workplaces from becoming "special economic zones" without rights and safety measures for workers, with laws that Adonis Georgiades voted for, which SYRIZA also supported. As a result, we are mourning one dead and two crippled workers in the Perama Zone. It is significant that a large part of the Shipbuilding Collective Labour Agreement, which the union managed to sign after struggles in 2017, relates to health and safety measures. The previous Syriza government and the next ND government did not make this CBA compulsory, but the workers made it compulsory with their struggle after the new employer crime, as it is one step before their collective agreement has the force of law for all companies. We are proud that in these and so many other struggles, the KKE and its deputies were in front.
