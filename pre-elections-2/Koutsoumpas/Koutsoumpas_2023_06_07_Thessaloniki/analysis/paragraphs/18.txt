Friends, comrades, and companions, in the past period, peoples in several countries have mobilized and gone on nationwide strikes. Similarly, in our country, the past years have been marked by major strike mobilizations in sectors and workplaces. And if one conclusion can be drawn, it is that no bourgeois government, no matter how many deputies it has, is omnipotent when there is a workers' and people's movement, when there is a strong KKE! A strong KKE means a strong workers' movement, strong people to put obstacles, to delay, to have conquests, as we have done so far. With the magnificent mobilizations and strikes in March, with the basic demand that the responsibilities for the crime of Tempe should not be covered up. The thousands of young mouths chanting 'PASOK-Syrizas-New Democracy, this crime has a history' record a dynamic that must not be broken. On the contrary, it must grow stronger, spread out, and become an organized current of assertion. And the impetus for this can only be given by a much stronger KKE in the June elections.
