This law characterizes wages and insurance as costs, despite the fact that no good or service can be produced without the work of those who receive them. The same law considers life and health protection measures to be costs, and has recently broken up 57 families in Tempe, been responsible for dozens of employer crimes in various sectors and workplaces, and has wiped out working-class families. With this law, the 150 business groups recorded over 10 billion euros in profits in 2022, an increase of over 300%. And what is the condition for all this? A minimum wage that has remained the same since 2012, 11 years ago, and an average wage that is 25% lower than in 2011. People pay 95% of direct and indirect taxes, while big business groups pay only 5%, and this has been the case for a long time. It takes a lot of nerve to pretend that they have different approaches to taxation when neither of them has changed that ratio. What else is a prerequisite for their profits? One in two new jobs are part-time or rotational, with an average net salary of just over â‚¬300 per month. 6,000 workers lose their jobs every day and are recycled between unemployment and job insecurity, and this is the reality for workers in Central Macedonia and in the mines in the region. On the one hand, there is 680 million euros in funding for the Skouries project, and the ores are sold at record prices. On the other hand, there are extreme work intensification conditions and collective dismissals at the project by contractors.
