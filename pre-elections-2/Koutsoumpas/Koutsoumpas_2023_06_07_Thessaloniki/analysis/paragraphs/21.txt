We are proud because, with the contribution of the communists, workers in many workplaces did not relegate their just demands to the second presence of the expectation of governmental changes and fought the battle in tough confrontation with the employers and the laws that support them. They did not put up with the false big talk of more capitalist investment as a solution to their problems. They did not step on the banana peel for struggles at the limits of the economy's endurance, namely the profits of the business groups. They did not see the workers' bargaining with the employers over how much less we will lose as a solution, as the leadership of the GSEE and ADEDY calls for. We all together, with a strong KKE and mass struggles, can impose our rights, the abolition of all the anti-worker laws of the ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK on Collective Labour Agreements and wages. The restoration of collective bargaining by adopting the demands of the trade unions for increases above €850 and at the same time the restoration of triennial wages. This practically means that a worker with a three-year contract will see their salary increase to €935 today, not in 2027 as promised by ND, although this became a summer dream after the Commission's recommendations. This proposal is linked to the other proposals of the KKE for a fixed daily working time, 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours, and no unpaid overtime, with the restoration of Sunday holidays. It is linked to the proposal for an inflation-based wage adjustment clause. With the restoration of the 13th and 14th salaries in the public sector, about which the South West, PASOK, and SYRIZA say nothing, and the granting of all salary scales. With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles, we can impose the restoration of the sectoral collective labour agreements and their compulsory nature without terms and conditions, which is a basic condition for increasing wages in all scales. This is the only pro-people's answer.
