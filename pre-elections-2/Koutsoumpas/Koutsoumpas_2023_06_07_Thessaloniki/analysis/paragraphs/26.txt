Remember that in the last 15 years we have had LAOS, DIMAR, ANEL, POTAMI, CENTRIST UNION, MERA25, all of whom entered parliament, deceived and seduced the people, especially young people, giving a breath of life to the rotten system. These parties are so "young" that they propose radical measures for the working people, such as NIKI, which proposes forced labor with increased deductions for those who owe loans. In other words, slave labor so that the banks do not lose a single euro.
