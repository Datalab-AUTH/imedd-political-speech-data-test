We keep hope alive by strengthening collective struggles against compromise and disillusionment cultivated by the forces of social democracy, thus also feeding New Democracy. Only together with the KKE can we create cracks in the negative correlation. Everything changes when the many decide with their actions! You know where the KKE will be the next day, unlike ghost parties that "noisily" appear and "quietly" withdraw when they have completed their mission on behalf of the system. There is no time to waste. Much less do we have votes to lose, such as those of the so-called small parties, the "disposable parties", such as those now out of parliament. They are parties that are recruited to be used in various games within the bourgeois political system, and then with the same ease that they appeared, they are withdrawn. Like now, the Hellenic Solution, where the leader of this party is tried and tested against popular interests. MP for LAOS when the government of ND, PASOK, LAOS brought in the 2nd memorandum. Member of ND when the government of ND, PASOK, DIMAR was implementing it. Just so we don't forget.
