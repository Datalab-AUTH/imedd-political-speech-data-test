No vote, therefore, should be "let's go and wherever it comes out", but should fall, with even greater determination, only to the KKE! For another important reason. Because it is the only party that has a power-governance program with the workers at the helm of power, real owners of the wealth produced. Because the KKE does not see workers as dots, nor does it divide them into green, blue, and pink. That's why they don't say "good riddance" because they voted for one party or the other, as others do. They are flesh and blood, and they see them as the class that produces all the wealth around us and that has the power, when it decides to do so, to turn it all upside down. For in the present barbarism, there is a way out for the interests of the people in the conflict and overthrow of the rotten, corrupt system. Let us go to make the KKE even stronger, therefore, so that the people can be strong against the next anti-people's government, so that the prospect of the better days we want to live and will live can be strengthened. Only the people can save the people, on the road to overthrow with a strong KKE!
