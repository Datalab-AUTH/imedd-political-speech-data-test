The KKE has elected two deputies in Thessaloniki: Yannis Delis in the 1st district and Leonidas Stoltidis in the 2nd district. Over the past four years, they have been at the forefront of the struggles of the people and youth in the region. Together, they have fought to defend the rights of the people in every aspect of their lives, including labor, income, the environment, health, education, and the defense of people's housing from the banks and funds. From 2019 to 2023, the KKE submitted over 600 questions, topical questions, and reports to Parliament regarding the problems faced by the people in Thessaloniki and Central Macedonia in general.
