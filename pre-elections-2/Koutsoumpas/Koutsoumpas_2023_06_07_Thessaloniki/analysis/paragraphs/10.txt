Friends, companions, and comrades, what the KKE said during the pre-election, that the next government will be unpopular, is now understood by more people. The only question that exists today is who can form a real opposition to the government of the South-West. We have already revealed to the people that hard times are ahead. The government's "next day" program is concrete: it is a return to "bloody" primary surpluses from this year, with a "plunge" of direct and indirect taxes. It is the more than 350 unpopular preconditions and "reforms" for the Recovery Fund super-memorandum to put in place over â‚¬32 billion for business groups to make profitable investments.
