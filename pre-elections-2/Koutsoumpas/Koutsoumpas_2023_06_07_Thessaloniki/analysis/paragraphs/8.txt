The KKE deputies fought alongside them and highlighted the problems and demands of pupils, students, and learners. They demanded that the degrees of EPAS-OAED students not be degraded, that their schools be equipped, and that their suspension period's work tickets be honored. They also demanded that PASTER IEKs students be given practical training without additional burden. Lastly, they demanded that IPEE students be given internships at Hippocrates and Papageorgiou Hospitals with full wage, insurance, and labor rights.
