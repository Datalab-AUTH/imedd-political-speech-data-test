Friends and comrades, We are once again in Thessaloniki to fight with even greater optimism in the new electoral battle for the strengthening of the KKE. A positive step was taken in the May elections, despite the negative correlation that remains. Now we are preparing for the next ones. We know that the strengthening of the KKE was the only element of the election result that made many people smile, even those who did not vote for it in the end. We urge them to do so now, so that we can all smile together. We must cut off the smiles of those who dream of "all-powerful" governments that will crush working people, or those who foster such fears to blackmail people at the ballot box again. We need an even stronger KKE for 100% militant, popular opposition to the unpopular policies of the New Democracy government and the consensus that everyone else will give it. This is what will count for the people in the face of the hardships they are preparing for the next day. That is why we say: on June 25th, a strong KKE, because hope is only here! The significant rise of the KKE in the Region of Central Macedonia, in all its electoral districts, in all urban centers and villages, fills us with optimism because it proves the growth of the Party's prestige among the people. It shows that the vote for the KKE is a conscious choice of thousands of people who have joined the communists in recent years on all fronts of struggle for the defense of the rights of the people and youth, against the policies that are crushing their lives. The emergence of the KKE as the third party in the popular neighborhoods, in the third and fourth districts of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, reflects the ties that have developed over the last few years through the struggles and diverse other actions where communists have taken the lead.
