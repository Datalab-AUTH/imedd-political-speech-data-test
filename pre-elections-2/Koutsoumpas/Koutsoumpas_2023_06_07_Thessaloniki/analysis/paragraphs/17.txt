The young man and woman who work in the food service industry on minimum wage cannot blame their bad luck. Those who decided that the minimum wage should be set by the government of the day, and that this should be based on the criterion of boosting the competitiveness of businesses, are to blame. This law has a name, in fact, it has two names: it is called the Vroutsis-Achitsioglu law. The first brought it, the second activated it. The trade employee who does not know what time she will get off work is not to blame for supposedly 'not organizing her schedule well'. The laws of the New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK took off the arrangement of working hours, they ripped up the Sunday holiday. Public sector workers do not have a 13th and 14th salary, not because they are full of money. Those who governed are responsible because they 'forgot' years ago to restore the gifts that were cut off and even recently rejected the amendment we tabled. The fact that we have had a 49% reduction in regular staff at EYATH in recent years is due to the commercialization policy followed by all governments and is also a prerequisite of the recovery fund that the other parties are worshipping. The fact that the workplaces have become a vast valley of Tempe has the stamp of the ND, SYRIZA, PASOK. The tragic lack of safety measures and non-existent controls 'go hand in hand' with intensification, rubber-neck work, generalized labor exploitation, and the increased retirement age. All of this puts workers in increasing danger to their own lives. This is the reason why we count one worker dead every three days. In this three-year period alone, workers in the municipality of Thessaloniki have had 120 accidents at work.
