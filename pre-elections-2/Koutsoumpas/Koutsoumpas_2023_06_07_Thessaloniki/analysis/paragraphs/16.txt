The same goes for young men who work in Halkidiki during the season. There are investments reaching 150 million euros for large hotel units, with profitable parties for the big players in the industry who are expecting record numbers this year. There are also more than 10 different forms of employment, with nominal wages at the 2007 level for employees. Therefore, especially for young people working in the season, do not hesitate! Overcome the obstacles put up by those who have rejected the proposals of the KKE to make it easier for them to exercise their rights and support the KKE. The communists in parliament and outside in the streets of the struggle are fighting against the miserable working conditions of food and tourism workers.
