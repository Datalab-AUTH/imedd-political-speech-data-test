This was the work of the KKE MPs from Thessaloniki in Parliament, while the MPs from other parties were busy voting for one unpopular bill after another. You know very well what the work of the KKE MPs was outside of Parliament as well, because you saw them every day by your side. That is why we say that the working people of Thessaloniki have an absolute interest in sending not only these two KKE deputies to the new Parliament, but also more. For example, the people of the first part of Thessaloniki do not need the nine ND deputies elected on May 21, who could become more now with the unacceptable bonus that steals seats from other parties. They do not even need the 4 SYRIZA MPs. They need more communist, militant deputies from the KKE. We therefore call on those who trusted the KKE, many for the first time, to do so again. Because now they have more reason to do so. Let no vote be lost due to abstention. We call on those who thought about voting for the KKE but hesitated at the last moment to do it now. So that we are all stronger together on June 26 to continue to fight the battle for the interests of the "many".
