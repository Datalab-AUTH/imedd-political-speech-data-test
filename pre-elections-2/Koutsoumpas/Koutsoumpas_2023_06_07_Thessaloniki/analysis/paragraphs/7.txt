To increase funding and recruit all necessary staff in hospitals and health centers for the reopening of all ICUs in hospitals in the region, for the staffing of the neonatal intensive care unit at Hippokratio, for the staffing and transfer of the day care unit at Theagenio. But also for the problems of the employees in EODY, KETHEA, and Okanas. And of course, we brought the issue of staffing the ambulance to Parliament with immediate recruitment of drivers and rescuers who, if they had been hired, might have saved the lives of the woman in Kos and the young girl in Nea Makri. How cynical and unacceptable are Pleyris' statements that we cannot have public health structures all year round on an island because it is filled with tourists in the summer? They want tourism and profits all year round, but the health of the people is a 'cost' to them. How timely is the slogan 'their profits or our lives'.
