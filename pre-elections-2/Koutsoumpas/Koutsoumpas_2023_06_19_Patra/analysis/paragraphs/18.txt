Yes, we will have to raise Mr. K.E.'s percentages even higher, very high, in Kefalonia and Zakynthos, as well as in all of our islands. We must also focus on the working-class neighborhoods of Patras that brought us happiness in the previous elections. These areas have confirmed the prestige of our party and its militant ties with thousands of people, and can contribute even more to increasing the strength of the M.C.E. throughout the country.
