We have a responsibility to the people who have put their trust in us and look to us, even if they don't agree with us on everything. We have a duty. As we have always done, now we must find ourselves on the Monday after the election, where injustice will grow, people will groan under new suffering, authoritarianism and repression will grow stronger, and the selective incompetence of the capitalist state will leave us unprotected from natural disasters. We look forward with courage and stamina because we know that the people can save themselves by walking the path of subversion. With Mr. C.E. much stronger, we can do it in the few days left before polling Sunday. We are doing our best to ensure that no vote is lost for the party. Yes, it is up to all of us to go together with Mr. C.E. above to make the people vote themselves. Good strength and health to all. We move forward, hope is here.
