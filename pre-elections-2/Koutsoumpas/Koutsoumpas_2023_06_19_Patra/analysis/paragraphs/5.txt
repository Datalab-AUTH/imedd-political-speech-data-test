We are in this whole debate. We also want to say one thing clearly. Yes, everyone can feel human when they go out on the street, stand up in shock and anger, and defend the life of every human being who is being priced too high in this system and ultimately priced too cheaply by decision makers for the few to pay too dearly. For Mr. C. E., the dilemma of profits or lives is answered every day in the struggle to overturn this injustice and the laws that impose it on the struggle. It is for all of us, especially our children, to live better.
