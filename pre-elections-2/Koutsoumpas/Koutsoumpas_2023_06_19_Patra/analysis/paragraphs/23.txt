They all have the European Union Recovery Fund as their holy grail, as you have heard. For three years now, while everyone was talking about European Union money trees, he has been talking about a new super-memorandum, about billions directed only to big corporations, about loans and grants that are disbursed only if new unpopular measures are passed, about money that will be paid for by the tax drain of the Greek people. Even Mitsotakis, in an interview a few days ago, described it as a memorandum with specific commitments. The European Union itself has sent a decree that states taxes paid by the Greek people must be increased in order to repay the loans and interest.
