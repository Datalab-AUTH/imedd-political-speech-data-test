None of them have costed programs. All of them have absolutely no costed programs. And do you know why? Because they all have fiscal stability and the notorious resilience of the capitalist economy as an inviolable condition. They all swear allegiance to the sacred rules of the bloody surpluses of the European Union. But it is these economic resilience and modern investment tools that allow hundreds of millions of euros to be given to energy groups to build charging stations for electric cars. However, in Greece in 2023, people will die because there are no ambulances or ambulance drivers and rescuers. The competitiveness of the Greek economy and the notorious production model that every party in the system has been saying for 50 years that it will reform, brings only huge profits for companies and a drop in the average real wage for workers. It brings smiles, you see, to the big shipbuilding contractors in Perama. But it brings tears and anger to workers who are counting dead and crippled.
