All of them have voted for and implemented inhumane policies of the European Union on refugees, for example, asylum, and some members of New Democracy are spewing the poison of humanitarianism. At the same time, on the other hand, SYRIZA has gone beyond any limit of hypocrisy. They talk about the right to asylum that all refugees have, when it was SYRIZA that incorporated the concept of a safe third country into Greek legislation, which effectively tramples this right under the carpet. He talks about the responsibilities of the European Union. Well, who implemented Dublin for four and a half years? Who enlarged the hellhole of Moria? Who implemented the Joint Declaration of the European Union and Turkey that inflated this problem with the uprooted people and the inhabitants of our islands? They ask and rightly so. What are the protocols that Frodex implemented to save people? But these gentlemen ought to know the answer, since SYRIZA boasts that he was the one who called for NATO warships to solve the refugee problem in the Aegean. Didn't he know, he asked.
