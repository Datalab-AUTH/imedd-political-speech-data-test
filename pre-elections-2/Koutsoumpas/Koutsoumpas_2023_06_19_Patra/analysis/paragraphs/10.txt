As long as we approach the refugee problem with realism, we will honor the memory of the little Aylan children who were lost a few days ago. We will show solidarity with all persecuted individuals, make practical suggestions to abolish the European Union's unacceptable agreements, establish asylum committees in Turkey, and facilitate refugees' travel to their intended destinations. We will strive to eliminate the corrupt system that perpetuates crises, war, poverty, and displacement.
