We want to speak out, as we have done all these years, especially to every progressive person here in Patras, in Achaia. In other words, we should talk to all those who support Kostas Peletidis and the municipal authority of Patras, which has cut the ties of various local and nationwide parties and has led to the paralysis of various local members of other parties. We want to appeal to all those with whom we managed to make the Labour Centre a point of reference for workers, for the workers of the city of the prefecture, when the system of employers who had confused unionism with the management of subsidies and Community programmes was broken. We are addressing all those who smile and feel proud that in Patras too, the Panspoudastiki among the students continues to raise its rates to become the first force. We speak to all those whose hearts and souls have been warmed, because they see with many examples that so much can be done when the people fight to save the people. So we say clearly: the wolf that never wears the sheepskin of Syriza, never of PASOK, no matter how much he is baptized, no matter how much he dyes his hair, never changes his mind, never changes his head. What thousands of people have done, that is, become disillusioned and abandon it, especially PASOK, but also other parties. Here, especially in Achaia, it must be stronger in these elections.
