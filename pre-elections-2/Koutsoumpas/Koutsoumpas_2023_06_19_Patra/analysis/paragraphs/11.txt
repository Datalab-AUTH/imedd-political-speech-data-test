Friends, companions, and comrades, in daily life that unfortunately constantly confirms that things are going to be difficult for the people and the country, especially for the youth, what New Democracy, SYRIZA, and PASOK say a few days before the elections seems to be more comically tragic. We are told by New Democracy that if a strong self-reliant government emerges, we have nothing to fear. Greece, they say, will move forward and leave no one behind. Since these proposals are not worthy of serious comment, we would say that they should send a member of the New Democracy party to Europe's largest economy. There, according to Germany, which has entered a phase of economic recession, so that they too can save the country. On the other hand, the fall of Syriza also has no end. They have gone so far as to say that anyone who does not vote for Syriza in these elections is supporting New Democracy. As a matter of fact, they're sticking to that again. Because with Marantzidis as an advisor, they could draw historical parallels, like during the occupation when he claims that anyone who didn't support the collective governments and fascists and participated in the resistance was, he says, feeding the Nazi crimes. As if we were not ashamed, but the very grief, apart from insanity, also generates plenty of reaction. PASOK, on the other hand, is setting its sights on the rebirth of the Democratic Party to become the dream of progressive people, says its New East. But the dreams of the PASOK cadres we have a lot of experience of how they turned into a real nightmare for the people.
