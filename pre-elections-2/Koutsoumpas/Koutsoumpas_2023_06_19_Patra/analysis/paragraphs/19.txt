It will be necessary not to scatter the vote to parties that are clearly reactionary personalities and always useful political puppets, unfortunately of this system. But, well, it is not a matter of concern, really, to any sensible person, the excessive promotion of Mrs Konstantopoulou. What happened all of a sudden? Are they running out of reality shows and thought maybe they should get involved with the movement of supposed love? Even mockery has its limits. Not to mention the fact that this particular political lawyer has a checkered past. She is indeed consistent in her views, but it was her views that led her not even to bring Mr C.E.'s proposal for a law to abolish the memoranda when she was President of Parliament. She was of the opinion, you see, that the repeal of the unjust laws of the memorandum was, as she had said, a figure of speech to justify Tsipras saying so, that is, to fool the people. So that is why this lady has a certain present to have no positions on any problem of our people, absolutely youth. Just some generalities. The only time she gets specific was and is when she wants to coddle the orphans of Golden Dawn, since wherever she stands and wherever she is she basically characterizes them as an antisystemic force. That is why she has a predetermined future. That is, what all these parties have are shooting stars whose main characteristic over time is to support with votes or even with their MPs, governments and the rest of the parties of the system to have no positions on any popular problem, nor any presence. Where the people and the young generation are struggling to catch their breath to crush injustice. Who does not remember the journalist with the backpack who voted for the third memorandum and his MPs then got taken away by Potami? That was his party and they scattered to New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK. What can one say today about the DIMAR, the LAOS, Leventis, Kammenos of ANEL and so many others? As they came, so they disappeared.
