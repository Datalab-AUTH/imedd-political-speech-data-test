You heard them regret holding the record for passing all three memoranda. PASOK tells us they saved the country by paying the political cost. Big deal, good guy. So let's thank them for skinning us. Did you hear them regretting that they were in government with New Democracy and Karatzaferis? But these, even as baptized people. Now they voted for 70% of Mitsotakis' bills and said they were ready to do it again, as long as Mitsotakis was not prime minister. Did you listen, did you see among the prominent cadres, especially in PASOK, any honest and militant trade unionists from among those who for many years may have existed within PASKE? No. It is now in their DNA those who stayed there as Panagopoulos and Karra Georgopoulos syndicalism. Social democracy, sinful in all respects, did not all switch to SYRIZA. You see it stayed in the orthodox one too. One only has to look at the Brussels side.
