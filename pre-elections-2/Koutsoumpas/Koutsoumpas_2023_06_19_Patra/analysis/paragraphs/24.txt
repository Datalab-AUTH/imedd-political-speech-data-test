All of them recognize that healthcare today is a commodity, meaning that private healthcare parasites prey on it, while the public system operates on private economic criteria. The revulsion caused by the New Democracy MP, who spoke of the unaffordability of cancer care like a modern-day Mengele fascist, is only one thing. But are these statements really so foreign to the policies implemented by both the New Republic and SYRIZA and PASOK? Who closed more than 10 hospitals in Greece and kept them closed? Who ruled during the years when healthcare costs for our people skyrocketed? Who increased the contribution to pharmaceutical expenditure? And which of these parties with supposedly realistic proposals supported Mr. K.E.'s proposal for an attack on the private health sector that was making a fortune on the backs and money of the workers when the people were facing an unprecedented pandemic situation?
