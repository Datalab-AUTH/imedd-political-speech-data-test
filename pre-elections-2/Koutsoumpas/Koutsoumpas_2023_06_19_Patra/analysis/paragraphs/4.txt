But we are also a few days after another predictable crime: the shipwreck off Pylos that continues to shock us all. Mr. C.E. is once again taking responsibility and speaking clearly against the rot and cynicism of all the voices in the system. There is the choice of the action of organized struggle in the face of what freezes the soul, against statements that only cause nausea, such as how much a search and rescue operation costs Greece, as others say. There will be a Mr. C.E. who will say when a mother and her child enter the hold of a nutcracker. Everything must be done to protect human life at sea and save it, as provided for by international conventions.
