Especially here in Fthiotida, we have met, and I personally, because of my candidacy, more times than anywhere else. We have traveled practically all over the prefecture, talking to the people of our country. All of this effort will be our greatest asset come Monday in the battles we will fight. These problems that you have brought to us, we will fight them together starting tomorrow, and we will bring them to the House of Representatives. We will do everything in our power to prevent negative developments, anti-people's measures, to achieve the slightest conquest, to open, together with the people, a radically different path for our country. And you know that when the KKE says something during the pre-election, it also says it afterward. But until then, we have the crucial Sunday. Because, as true as it is that we will give our best no matter what percentage the people give us, it is just as true that it is one thing for 15 KKE MPs to plow the country as they have done so far, and another for there to be 26 or more. It is one thing for the KKE to have a deputy in Fthiotida and another for it not to have one. Let us, therefore, make the greatest possible effort in the three days left. Whoever voted for the KKE on 21 May must now overcome every obstacle and do it again. Only this Sunday's vote will count in the end and will follow us for four years. The ballot box on June 25 will indeed be empty... And for the people to be strong, they will have to fill it with the red ballots of hope and struggle, the ballots of the KKE.
