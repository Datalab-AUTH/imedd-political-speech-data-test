Friends, companions, and comrades, now that this very long election period is over, which started practically as soon as the year began, we can say with certainty that the great effort we have made has already brought us forward, stronger. Because we have had the opportunity to travel around the country, to get in touch with many more people, more intensively than before, to discuss the party's positions, to answer questions and concerns, and, of course, to listen to many opinions on what the main problems are and how we can deal with them.
