Friends, companions, and comrades, the essence of the problem, both in health and in industrial accidents, as well as in the crime of Tempi, which has shaken this city and its youth, and which we insist on not letting be forgotten, and in the many years of shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, lies in a slogan that the KKE has "thrown" to the people and seems to be touching more and more people. This slogan says: Either their profits or our lives! We answer: we are with the lives of the people. This must be expressed even more on Sunday. We are sure that those who took the step and voted for the JCP, many of them for the first time, already feel that their choice has been confirmed. Because the KKE, in the few days that have passed since the last elections, has once again demonstrated in practice how it understands the opposition, the role that its deputies will play, how it will use whatever extra power the people give it. In the battles against the auctions, which only yesterday we managed to thwart another seven, in the struggles for collective labor agreements, in the mobilizations against the unregulated expansion of renewable energy, and so much more. Everywhere our people are being tested, where their hearts are beating, where our people are struggling, the KKE is there. It will be beside the workers, beside the working class, beside the breadwinners, the farmers and professionals, the young children and women of the people's families, who are fighting the battle for survival.
