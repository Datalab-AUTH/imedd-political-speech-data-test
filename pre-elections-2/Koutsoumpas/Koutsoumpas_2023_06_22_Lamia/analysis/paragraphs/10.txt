This is exactly the kind of battle the farmers are fighting here in Fthiotida when we are having a very difficult year in the agricultural sector. Almost all productions are in serious trouble because of the prolonged rainfall and low temperatures in the previous months. What to do first? For the clovers that have lost 2 cuts without compensation? For the olive trees that have been hit, while those that have already been through from the previous year are being sold below cost? For the cereals that the prices given are too low, far below cost? For the cotton that is stuck, with the risk of losing the linked ones due to the satellite controls? One of the same for sunflowers, one of the same for rice. No company has signed contracts with prices, all the prices are open, the ODA declarations have not been opened, and the producers do not even know what subsidies they will receive because of the new CAP, so the situation is going 'into the unknown with a boatload of hope'... We will not allow the destruction of the organic farmers. We will get ahead in the struggle to claim income replacement in all crops and production to stay in production and in their place, in their villages, the farmers of Fthiotida and the whole country.
