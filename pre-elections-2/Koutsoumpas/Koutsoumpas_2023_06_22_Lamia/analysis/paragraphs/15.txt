Yes, we will go to the ballot box on Sunday with great anger for the hundreds of souls lost off Pylos. This is a new crime of the European Union and its policies, governments, and the parties that shaped and implemented them. Ultimately, it is a new crime of the bloody system of exploitation. They have all sowed bombs and poverty in several countries, established bases on Greek soil for warplanes to take off, and then raised fortresses to prevent their victims from passing through. However, no one will convince us that we have to choose between the shipwrecks that occurred under ND and the shipwrecks that occurred under SYRIZA. We will not choose between the hellhole of Moria, for which our country was condemned a few days ago by the international courts, and the pushbacks of ND. We will not let this recent crime be forgotten. We will continue to ask relentless questions about what happened that night off Pylos with all the power of our voice, even after the elections.
