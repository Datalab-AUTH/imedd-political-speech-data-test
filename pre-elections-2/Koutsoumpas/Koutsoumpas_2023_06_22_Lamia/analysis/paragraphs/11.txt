Friends, we have already demonstrated that no government is powerful when faced with a strong workers' and people's movement, and an even stronger KKE. We know that there are thousands of people who did not ultimately vote for the KKE, but who were nonetheless pleased with the Party's increased numbers. Come and join us now, take this small step, and we can all smile even more on Sunday. Does anyone truly have a reason not to want the JCP to be strengthened? Is there anyone?
