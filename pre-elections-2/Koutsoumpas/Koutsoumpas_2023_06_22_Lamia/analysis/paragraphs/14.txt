But not just 1%, even one person taking a step counts and makes a difference because it is another consciousness moving forward. One person can stand side by side, hand in hand with those who, through organized collective struggle, multiply the pockets of resistance and assertion. So, on Sunday, we will go to the ballot boxes with heart, mind, and rage. Our heart beats for all the working people in this country. We do not see these people as pipsqueaks, put labels on them, or single them out based on their vote, religion, or orientation. We only consider whether they belong to the exploiters or those being exploited in today's society. We are ready at any moment to throw our bodies into the fire to defend them all, without asking what color the map was painted in their region. Our minds and thoughts are dedicated to their liberation, the liberation of all from the shackles of exploitation, and to building another, more just society where the free development of each is also the precondition for the free development of all. Our anger at the crimes of this system is not selective.
