Do not rush to reply. Of course, there are those who know that the stronger the JCP is, the more it will make life difficult for them, and the more it will squeeze them. That's why they are trying to silence our voice, with exclusion from the media, punishing fines supposedly for poster pollution, legal proceedings against our cadres who stand in front of the struggles of the people and youth, and even with cyber attacks on our websites lately. They are tiring in vain... These things don't work here. They don't get off so easily with us, neither those who dream of omnipotence, nor those who dream of recasting the old or the recent two-party system, nor the system they all serve together. And know this: the attempt to silence will not go unanswered!
