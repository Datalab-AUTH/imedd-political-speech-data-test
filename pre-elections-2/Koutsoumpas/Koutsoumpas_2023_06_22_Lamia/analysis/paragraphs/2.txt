Friends, in this election, we are facing an unfair electoral law that steals seats from all parties and gives them as a bonus to Mr. Mitsotakis, as if he inherited them from his father. Therefore, in order to maintain this progress, even more people in our prefecture should support the KKE. They have every reason to do so because when the exploiters are happy, from Monday they will have a self-reliant government to do their work for them. The workers, the working people, and the breadwinners can also be happy for the exact opposite. Against this government, there will be a 100% popular, militant opposition. And that can only be the KKE!
