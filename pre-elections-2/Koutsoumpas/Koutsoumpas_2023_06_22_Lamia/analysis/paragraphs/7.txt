And do not overlook their withdrawal of the candidate who made those disturbing comments about cancer patients. Are there not lives being lost today - where what he proposed is not happening - that could have been saved if the public healthcare system operated on a cost-benefit basis? Where else is the situation like the one in the hospital in Lamia, for example, today? Where else is the tragic shortage of ambulances and staff that led to the well-known tragic results a few days ago in Nea Makri, Chalkidiki, Kos, and elsewhere? And does SYRIZA, which was - rightly - criticized for this statement, know nothing about all this? If it does not adopt the cost-benefit criterion in healthcare, if it does not measure profits and losses, but only human lives, as it has been saying lately, then why did it not open any of the 16 public hospitals closed by previous governments, but closed an additional one in Patras? And because we now know the answer, he will tell us that at that time they had the Troika "over their heads" and did not implement their program... You know, that Troika that they would have kicked out, by the way, and all the time here orts... Now that, as he tells us, there are no more memoranda and restrictions, why did he say that not even as many doctors can be recruited as are provided for in the organizational charts, but he simply proposed to recruit a few more than those who are leaving?
