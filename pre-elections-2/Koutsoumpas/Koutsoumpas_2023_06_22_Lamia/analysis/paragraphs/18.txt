Because with a strong Mr. C.E. who knows and can take on governments, the system, and unpopular policies, along with a strong working people's movement, no government can be omnipotent. Because all of Mr. C.E.'s deputies will be found by the people next day, fighting for a better life. Because votes in Kuwait cannot be bargained for governmental institutions, chairs in unpopular governments cannot be mutated or bought, and they cannot be quietly withdrawn. As we have seen repeatedly happen with so many parties in the past that none of us remember today, it will happen again with the various ghost parties that no one saw coming. Over the past four years, the people and the youth have gone through many trials and tribulations, and now they are being sold to us as anti-systemic. Because Mr. C.E. has no commitments to the European Union, NATO, or the bloody profits of capital. Because a vote for the Kuwaiti people means a vote for our lives and not for their profits. It translates into conflict, disobedience, and all that we resent. Above all, it means optimism and hope that we will succeed, and that the people will eventually win. Because Mr. C.E. has a program of governing power with the people truly at the helm, the real owners of the wealth that they alone produce. Because in the present barbarism, there is a way out for the people in the conflict and overthrow of this rotten and corrupt system. So let's go hard, particularly here in Lamia, in Fthiotida, to keep Mr. C.E.'s seat in the prefecture. Every day, every hour, these few hours and days left until the polls close, we do battle on Sunday night to take our party much higher. Because JKE is strong, hope is here! Good strength and good health to all, and we will all make it. We move forward dynamically with the workers, professionals, farmers, and youth. Victory will ultimately be for our people.
