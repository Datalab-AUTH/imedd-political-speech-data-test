And there is no more resounding answer than for the KKE to come out of the ballot box even stronger. That will hurt them more than anything else! So our opponents understand very well what a difference 1% to 2% will make, especially for the KKE. Some of them, who ironically present themselves as leftists, ask themselves why they gave 41% to the South-West and do not bother to reduce it at all. It is clear that they are judging by looking in the mirror at themselves, weighing votes by their own criteria that are subordinate to this system. They are not only trying to knock Mr. C.E. but also prevent people from making a more radical, progressive real choice. At the same time, they are trying to lock voters into the direction they are going for Mr. C.E.
