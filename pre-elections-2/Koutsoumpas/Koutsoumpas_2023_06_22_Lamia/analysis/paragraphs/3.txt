In fact, the dilemmas that the parties of the system are trying to invent in order to blackmail the popular vote - now that there is no question as to what the next government will be - are becoming more and more funny, or even repulsive, as one takes it. The Southwest says that if a strong, self-reliant government emerges, we have nothing to fear. Investments will come, wages will rise, and we will become the leading power of the 4th industrial revolution, as your well-known Mr. In short, the roosters will even start to give birth. But when the next international crisis, which seems to be on the horizon, hits the Greek economy excessively because of the extroversion that they are advertising - to be clear - because they have made tourism a national industry and have left LARKO, the plutoproductive resources of our country, and other sectors to languish, then they will once again talk about imported problems, which they could not have foreseen and for which they are not responsible. They will again give no pass for mockery and let him who saves himself be saved, as with the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, inflation, energy poverty, and crisis.
