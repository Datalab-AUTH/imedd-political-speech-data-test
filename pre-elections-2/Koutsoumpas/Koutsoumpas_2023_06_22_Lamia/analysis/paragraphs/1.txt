Friends, companions, and comrades, we are here today in Lamia, three days before the elections, to convey once again to the people of Fthiotida the one and only hopeful message that can emerge from the ballot box of June. And that is the even greater strengthening of the KKE so that our people will be stronger the next day! We can do it; we have proved it. In the May elections, a step was taken both nationwide and here in Fthiotida. The KKE was strengthened in votes, percentages, and seats. And Fthiotida elected a communist MP for the first time in many years. And this is only a gain for its people. We know that this development did not come by chance. The people of Fthiotida, many of whom may not agree with us on everything, have rewarded the KKE's dedication to the interests of the people of the region, our constant presence here, and our systematic engagement with the problems. The workers of LARCO, for example, weighed who has been by their side all these years, inside and outside the factory, who is, after all, flesh and blood, and who is against them in their struggle to stay in their jobs and homes so that this great wealth of the region does not go to waste, so that this great wealth of the region is not handed over to big capital. And they gave the KKE 20% in the villages and towns of Lokrida where they live and work. This is the KKE; this is who we are! And this is the answer to SYRIZA and to Mr. Tsipras, who dared to say that "the KKE does not care how the workers live," "it only cares," he said, "to hold up its banners"! He should come here to say this to the workers of LARCO who have fought a heroic struggle with the communists in front. And as I was informed just now, the LARCO union elections have just ended, and the results have been announced. So for the first time there, the communists, the trade unionists, the class forces, this union has won 8 of the 9 seats on the Board of Directors, voting for the workers by 89%. Because we are interested in the worker having a living wage, living for his family, his children, returning home safe and sound. And if the KKE can today lead the working people's struggles, it is because on its banners - that is, on its political proposal - are written in large letters the modern needs of the workers, which will be satisfied by the society for which the KKE is fighting. And not, of course, the rotten system of exploitation and injustice that SYRIZA served both as government and opposition.
