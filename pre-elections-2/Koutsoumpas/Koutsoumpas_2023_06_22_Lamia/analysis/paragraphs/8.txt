Enough of the mockery. We are tired of saying it and we will not tire of it. These parties, ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, whatever their differences, share common programs and commitments. They are not going to deviate from the requirements of the Recovery Fund, the investment grade, or the new Stability Pact that the EU is preparing. That is why, in the face of the government of the South-West, it makes no sense for the other two parties to be stronger. They will exercise a consensual opposition and continue to vote for more than 50% and 70% of the bills respectively. SYRIZA and PASOK will make convenient, forward-looking criticism of the South-West for "deviating from the European guidelines" when it is precisely these guidelines that are the problem. This is truly a wasted vote for the people, as is a vote for ND or any party that swears by the current system that is crushing our lives for the gains of the few.
