Friends, companions, and comrades, will the people finally benefit from various emblematic projects for capital that are advertised as models of development by New Democracy and have been supported by SYRIZA and PASOK? The people in Attica are paying a fortune for various projects and infrastructures such as the "Great Walk" in the historic center of Athens, Hellenikon, the Coastal Front, and the Faliric Bay. These projects and infrastructures will be exploited for the needs of hotel and tourist groups and are aimed at incoming tourism with expensive wallets, while their use will become more expensive for the working and popular classes. There will be construction of luxury tourist complexes, marinas for luxury yachts, casinos that are the landmarks of gambling in Elliniko and Maroussi, with everything that will accompany them. And closed, very expensive beaches, commercialized areas for rest, recreation, etc., for the great majority of the people. After all, it has not been long since the operation to evict sports clubs and athletes from Agios Kosmas in Elliniko.
