The KKE sees the tourism economy as an integral part of another path of development, the socialist economy, in which the sources of wealth production, the enterprises, will have become social, people's property. They will work within the framework of central, scientific planning and under the control of the workers themselves, who will be in power, will be able to elect their representatives in a direct, authentic way and without the current blackmail, and who can be recalled at any time. Most importantly, they will work for the purpose of satisfying social needs, in this case the need for leisure and holidays, and not for the purpose of profit, on the altar of which all our needs are currently sacrificed. Only on this condition can tourism and economic activity be planned and developed for the benefit of the people and the workers in the sector, in proportion and in balance with agricultural and industrial production, energy, water and sewage infrastructure in cities and the countryside, in proportion to the needs of education and training of the workforce, as well as the needs of care and health, in balance with nature, so that social welfare becomes a measure of human intervention in nature, evaluating the positive and negative consequences of its effects. With this power, this path of development proposed by the KKE, tourism will become a right and a bridge of real friendship, acquaintance and cooperation between peoples. Recreation and relaxation will be a guaranteed right of the working class and the popular strata and not an expensive commodity. They will enjoy the beauties of the whole country with modern infrastructure, which they are now unable to do in a large proportion, mainly for economic reasons. Those working in the industry will also enjoy many more days of rest and recreation themselves. The forests, the beaches, the mountains, the cultural heritage of our country will give life and joy because they will belong to the people.
