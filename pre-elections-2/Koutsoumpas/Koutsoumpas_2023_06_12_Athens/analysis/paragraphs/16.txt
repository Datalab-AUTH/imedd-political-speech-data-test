Together with ND and PASOK, they handed over Elliniko to Latsis and the big conglomerates, receiving their congratulations. He "sells" sensitivity to tourism workers, but he has only commitments to the big bosses. PASOK abolished heavy and unhealthy work and the specialities of the sector, and is now trying to present itself as if it had not governed this country. Thanks to the laws of ND-Syriza-PASOK, big hotel owners and big catering groups have the 'loopholes' that are useful to them: to avoid the implementation of Collective Labour Agreements, to circumvent the working hours and days off of workers, and to not guarantee humane working, living, and living conditions for seasonal workers.
