The figures themselves reveal that with the same or fewer staff than last year, the work is more intense and exhausting. With half a million more tourists than in 2021 this year in Athens in the month of May alone, one can understand the workload on each of the city's hotel and restaurant workers who - at least for this year - didn't really understand the difference that the summer season makes compared to the winter. The waitresses are crippled from overwork, the waiters have shattered musculoskeletons from their endless hours of standing, and the cooks churn out millions of dishes every day, reflecting the "progress" and "prosperity" that the growth of the profits of the few brings to the many. The dozens of small and large employer crimes that the legislation calls 'accidents', the increased occupational diseases that have as their 'cost' the ability to work and even the very lives of workers, cannot be any indication of progress in a sector that is not as dangerous as industry. It is on this basis that employers' blackmail flourishes, such as those imposing a penalty of â‚¬5,000 on seasonal workers if they resign, precisely because they cannot stand these miserable working conditions!
