It was also evident that when the various parties, which the media system is overtly pushing today to get into Parliament, were gone, they were never seen next to it in a four-year period when so much happened and our people were tested again and again. The same will be tested in the next period because the next government of New Democracy will escalate the policy against the people to serve the interests of the hotel groups and the big businessmen of the catering industry with the consent of SYRIZA and PASOK. Only with the KKE in front have the workers experienced and felt in practice that only the people save the people, defending their rights to work, winning Collective Labour Agreements, and protection from employer arbitrariness. At the same time, ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK promoted tourism as the "engine of the economy," which is fueled by the intensity of exploitation of hotel workers and all workers in the sector.
