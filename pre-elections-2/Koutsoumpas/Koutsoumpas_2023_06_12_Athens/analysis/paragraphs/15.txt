This is capitalist development! "Miraculous" for the profits of the few, "nightmare" for the many! This is the growth served by the programs of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, who are competing to see who will be the best servant for the interests of the big groups, either from the position of the government or from the position of the opposition. And this "miracle" for the big business groups has the stamp of all the governments of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, in any composition and with the various supplements. They are committed to the Recovery Fund and the new 350 unpopular preconditions. They are committed to the Commission's guidelines that freeze three-year terms and wages. They are committed to primary surpluses and taxing the people, at the same time as they promote new tax breaks for business groups. New Democracy has the "honor and pride" of being the voice of the big groups, the tour operators, and the big hotel owners. Now, with the logic of the "best manager" and the banner of "stability," it is trying to get the vote of the workers to claim that it has their approval for its unpopular policies. SYRIZA, which is now boasting in words that it will make a strong opposition but in practice will continue with the "we'll settle accounts later," i.e. never, has supported together with ND a series of emblematic anti-people's bills.
