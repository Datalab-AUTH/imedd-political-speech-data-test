This is the power-government program of the KKE, which we are openly presenting to the people from today. We are ready to serve it from all positions when the people adopt it en masse, decide to follow the path we propose, and come out actively to impose their rights. This is the only truly pro-people perspective, which is another serious reason why the KKE deserves to be strengthened on June 25th, in the face of the permanent sacrifices and uncertainty envisaged by the anti-people's programs of all others. In any case, the KKE does not lose a minute and does not wait impassively until the people adopt its program. Besides, we know well that only in the battle, in daily action and demands, can consciences change. We are stepping forward today in the daily struggle to get immediate relief, prevent anti-worker and anti-people measures, and have new conquests. The stronger the KKE emerges from the June 25th elections, the more deputies it manages to elect, the stronger you, all the workers of our country, will be to improve our lives.
