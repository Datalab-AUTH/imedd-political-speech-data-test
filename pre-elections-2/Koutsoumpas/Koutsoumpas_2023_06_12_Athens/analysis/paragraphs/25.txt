No government gave them away. On the contrary, they were won by the workers in opposition to the governments of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, which were hostile to our demands. Whatever the workers won, they won because we answered the dilemma "their profits or our lives" by defending our lives militantly and decisively! So in the elections of 25 June, we are voting for our lives by casting the ballot paper of the KKE. Alone with the profits of the hotel owners, the tourist groups, the platforms, and the catering chains. And all of us, with the KKE and the power of the many, to bring the ups and downs! KKE strong, hope is here!
