Friends, companions, and comrades. The above incidents bring to the surface, with great emphasis, the diametrically opposite course that capitalist development is following in the tourism-residence sector in relation to the rights and well-being of the workers of the sector, the inhabitants of the tourist areas, and the people of our country as a whole. This is reflected not only in absolute numbers but in the very harsh reality that hotel and catering workers are experiencing for another summer. The "mass exodus" of 2.5 million people from the hotel industry is a major factor in the daily life of the hotel industry. The "mass influx" of 2.5 million tourists to Eleftherios Venizelos in May this year alone (a number increased by 23.4% compared to 2022 but also by 11.1% compared to 2019), the increase in travel receipts by 63.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, is the basis for the "happy news" of the big tourism groups, the advertisements on behalf of the government of the Southwest, and the parties that are in line with the goal of the "tourism miracle": SYRIZA, PASOK, and others.
