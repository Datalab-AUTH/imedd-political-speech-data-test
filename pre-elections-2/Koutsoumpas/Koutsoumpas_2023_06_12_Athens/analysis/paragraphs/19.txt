So now is the time to capitalize on everyone's achievements. New Democracy, SYRIZA, and PASOK, the parties that have pursued the aforementioned policy for the benefit of the few, committing crimes against the needs, rights, and lives of the many, must be punished at the ballot box. To strengthen the original opponent of their policy, the party that has been at the side of the workers with all its forces, with all its soul, putting obstacles, delaying negative developments that would have otherwise happened long ago, contributing decisively to any conquest. And you in your sector know well who this party is: it is the JCP. Friends, comrades, and companions, the KKE approaches the question of tourism in a fundamentally different light from all the others. It considers tourism to be a human need, a universal people's right directly related to the replenishment of labor power, not a commodity. In capitalist societies, as in our country, it began to be recognized through workers' struggles, to a certain extent, as a result of the influence of the countries that were building socialism, of the hard class struggle and conflict.
