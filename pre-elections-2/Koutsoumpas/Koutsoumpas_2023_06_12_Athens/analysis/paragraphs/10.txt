Now, according to big employers and their governments, it takes one person to work for ten in order to break records and fill their coffers even more. But in the income sector, there is no comparison. How can the 732.9 million in travel receipts in the first quarter of 2023 be weighed against the zero increase in restaurant workers? Or the increase of only 40 euros in the wages of hotel employees, where of course the sectoral collective agreement is applied? The hard-working workers in the sector, who are also experiencing - like all of us - the big price increase for popular consumer goods and the unabated tax evasion to which all the other parties agree, while at the same time they are defiantly taxing the groups, understand that it is not modern or progressive to work with 2009 wages or to receive an increase of a few cents of a euro a day. They know, and they live it, that this does not represent any stability for them and their families. Working in the season without days off and receiving meagre unemployment benefits in times of low traffic, for those who receive them and do not work uninsured, is not stability.
