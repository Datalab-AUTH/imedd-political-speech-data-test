But these rights are not enshrined as compulsory and free, despite the fact that the working class creates wealth and deserves to fully benefit from it. Only workers in socialist countries have won such rights, which include reduced working hours, guaranteed free holidays, and reduced retirement age. Domestic tourism with a focus on popular destinations, organized holidays and camps, and specialized networks for children and young people were also available in socialist countries. These rights remain a distant dream for the majority of workers in even the most developed capitalist countries.
