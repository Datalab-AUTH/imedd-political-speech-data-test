In a few days, workers will be called upon to answer the crucial question of whether they will choose to give their consent to the unpopular policy, either by voting directly for ND or by voting for the parties that will continue to "back it", at the ballot boxes that will be set up. Or whether they will choose to put up obstacles, to fight to squeeze out some conquests and open a different road, in alliance with the KKE.

This is the crucial issue: The workers need to send a loud warning message that the next unpopular government in the Southwest will have a hard time implementing its plans against the people. And this message can only be heard loudly in one way: by strengthening the KKE even more, both in votes and in percentages throughout the country. Because only the KKE is a 100% real fighting popular opposition. And this is beginning to settle as a conclusion in the minds of all those who have fought important militant battles together in the past period, settling altogether in the choices of progressive people.

This is where the answer lies, because SYRIZA and Tsipras, in their attempt to stop their downward slide, have the audacity to address progressive people, saying that "any progressive vote for parties other than SYRIZA objectively works to the benefit of ND". These are the familiar old, dirty old PASOK tricks that got us this far, and which the leftists and progressives knew very well in the past decades, so now they are furious with Tsipras for copying them. In fact, he said this at a meeting of their trade unionists. Those who know very well who, with their attitude for four years, stood back and worked for the benefit of the Southwest and who led the struggles to put obstacles in its way, to invalidate its anti-labour laws. Who is saying this? SYRIZA, which today enabled ND and Mitsotakis to brag about their almost 41%, after having fed them with hundreds of thousands of votes of people to whom they projected the logic that there is no alternative for the people. This is SYRIZA's and Tsipras' greatest offer to the system, that there is no way out for the people, except the current barbarity of the capitalist system. And this logic put forward by SYRIZA, both as a government and as an opposition, has objectively worked in favour of the New Democracy, the authentic pillar of the system, as was proven by the election result of May 21. So we have and we say! Objectively, and regardless of whether he understands it, it is for the benefit of the Southwest, who shares with the Southwest the common strategic objectives of capital, the same commitments to the EU, the USA, and NATO. That is why he voted with his hands and feet for the crucial anti-people's bills introduced by ND, as did SYRIZA and PASOK. SYRIZA gave it time to advance its unpopular reforms and hid their real content behind false claims, tripping up the struggles, the movement. Imagine if it did this with the 30%, what it will do now with the 20%. And to finish: The negative correlation as reflected in the election result includes not only ND but also SYRIZA and PASOK, altogether the parties of capital that share the same strategic convergences.

A ray of light in this black and spidery correlation is the electoral percentage of the KKE. This is said today not only by those who voted for the KKE for the first time, but also by those who thought about doing so and hesitated at the last moment, postponing it for later. They know that taking the KKE from 5.3% to 7.2% and now even higher means a greater contribution to the organization of the working people's resistance against the unpopular "work" of the new government. It means a greater number of deputies supporting the working people's demands, more voices defending and highlighting the interests of the workers and the people in parliament, and it means opening the way for more comprehensive changes and reversals. "It doesn't matter if the KKE goes from 7% to 8%," says Tsipras and continues to scratch the goat's slime. "But 1% more in the KKE is at least two more deputies who will make real opposition and be omnipresent. 1% more in SYRIZA is two MPs who will vote for most of Mitsotakis' bills as they did before. The even greater strengthening of the KKE means that a current of questioning of mainstream politics, its class character, the parties and governments that serve it, the capitalist state is being strengthened. It means that the search for a solution to today's problems through organized struggle, participation in the movement, and collective action is gaining strength. Where "only the people save the people" is put into practice! The optimistic and hopeful electoral result of the KKE is why, in the days and hours that remain, we will do everything in our power to make the KKE stronger. And this, my friends, comrades, compa√±eras, and comrades, the workers in tourism and catering know this firsthand. Only the KKE can oppose the next ND government from the point of view of their own interests with consistency, stability, and militancy. Only the KKE exercised such opposition, inside and outside the Parliament, in the previous ND government when SYRIZA voted for 50% of the ND bills and PASOK voted for 70%. Not to mention the votes in the European Parliament, where they feel more liberated, away from the domestic spotlight, and their agreement reaches 80% of the votes.

It was also evident that when the various parties, which the media system is overtly pushing today to get into Parliament, were gone, they were never seen next to it in a four-year period when so much happened and our people were tested again and again. The same will be tested in the next period because the next government of New Democracy will escalate the policy against the people to serve the interests of the hotel groups and the big businessmen of the catering industry with the consent of SYRIZA and PASOK. Only with the KKE in front have the workers experienced and felt in practice that only the people save the people, defending their rights to work, winning Collective Labour Agreements, and protection from employer arbitrariness. At the same time, ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK promoted tourism as the "engine of the economy," which is fueled by the intensity of exploitation of hotel workers and all workers in the sector.

But what is the "miracle" of capitalist development that we are presented with as a model? Only a few days ago, we had the death of a 63-year-old woman who was being taken by trolley to the hospital in the year 2023, in one of the most popular tourist destinations of our country, in Kos, where the state of the health system remains desperate, with tragic results. A tragic irony: From the same island had begun one of the most characteristic snapshots of the confluence of ND and SYRIZA on the main directions during the previous election period. It was from Kos that Mr Tsipras had proposed the use of the private health sector, where the public sector cannot reach, meaning the islands, only for Mr Mitsotakis to reply the next day that he had already voted for this. All well and good, then, and the patients in the trolleys breathing their last breath. In the same week, however, we had the death of the 19-year-old pregnant woman, also in a tourist area in eastern Attica. We also had the death of a tourist in Halkidiki because, once again, the ambulance of the understaffed ambulance service, which is understaffed in terms of resources and personnel and which is the responsibility of all the governments, failed to arrive in time. And the Southwest may have expelled from its ballot papers this unabashed man who reminded us of Nazi Mengele with his statements about terminal cancer patients, but it certainly did not expel the policy that puts everything on the scales of cost-benefit. This policy is all around us. It is responsible for all the crimes that we have experienced, most recently Tempe, the dead worker in Perama, the incidents mentioned above. It is this politics that all the parties in the system worship. What did Mr Plevris say after the incident in Kos? We cannot pay for public health facilities for 12 months on islands that are overcrowded in the summer months. The same thing they said about the ICUs during the pandemic when people were dying without receiving the help they should have received. What did Mr Tsipras say? The National Health System requires far more recruitment than we are proposing, but that's how much costing allows based on budgetary constraints. So let's not all act surprised when the rottenness and repulsiveness of their policies are reflected without fudging.

Friends, companions, and comrades. The above incidents bring to the surface, with great emphasis, the diametrically opposite course that capitalist development is following in the tourism-residence sector in relation to the rights and well-being of the workers of the sector, the inhabitants of the tourist areas, and the people of our country as a whole. This is reflected not only in absolute numbers but in the very harsh reality that hotel and catering workers are experiencing for another summer. The "mass exodus" of 2.5 million people from the hotel industry is a major factor in the daily life of the hotel industry. The "mass influx" of 2.5 million tourists to Eleftherios Venizelos in May this year alone (a number increased by 23.4% compared to 2022 but also by 11.1% compared to 2019), the increase in travel receipts by 63.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, is the basis for the "happy news" of the big tourism groups, the advertisements on behalf of the government of the Southwest, and the parties that are in line with the goal of the "tourism miracle": SYRIZA, PASOK, and others.

The figures themselves reveal that with the same or fewer staff than last year, the work is more intense and exhausting. With half a million more tourists than in 2021 this year in Athens in the month of May alone, one can understand the workload on each of the city's hotel and restaurant workers who - at least for this year - didn't really understand the difference that the summer season makes compared to the winter. The waitresses are crippled from overwork, the waiters have shattered musculoskeletons from their endless hours of standing, and the cooks churn out millions of dishes every day, reflecting the "progress" and "prosperity" that the growth of the profits of the few brings to the many. The dozens of small and large employer crimes that the legislation calls 'accidents', the increased occupational diseases that have as their 'cost' the ability to work and even the very lives of workers, cannot be any indication of progress in a sector that is not as dangerous as industry. It is on this basis that employers' blackmail flourishes, such as those imposing a penalty of ‚Ç¨5,000 on seasonal workers if they resign, precisely because they cannot stand these miserable working conditions!

The dramatic tones that described the unfilled jobs, which we read and heard about all winter and which supposedly endangered the "Greek miracle of tourism," have now become celebrations and calls for "heads to roll." Nothing and no one should disturb the rapid growth of the large tourist groups that were silenced during the two years of the pandemic. Then, it was revealed in the most striking way that these behemoths, without the workers, are just carcasses.

Now, according to big employers and their governments, it takes one person to work for ten in order to break records and fill their coffers even more. But in the income sector, there is no comparison. How can the 732.9 million in travel receipts in the first quarter of 2023 be weighed against the zero increase in restaurant workers? Or the increase of only 40 euros in the wages of hotel employees, where of course the sectoral collective agreement is applied? The hard-working workers in the sector, who are also experiencing - like all of us - the big price increase for popular consumer goods and the unabated tax evasion to which all the other parties agree, while at the same time they are defiantly taxing the groups, understand that it is not modern or progressive to work with 2009 wages or to receive an increase of a few cents of a euro a day. They know, and they live it, that this does not represent any stability for them and their families. Working in the season without days off and receiving meagre unemployment benefits in times of low traffic, for those who receive them and do not work uninsured, is not stability.

Students at tourism schools know that they are faced with a modern form of slave trade in the name of gaining work experience and completing their internship hours, which forces them into free labor. The examples in Attica are typical. In the region where large and "iconic" investments in luxury hotels are advertised, revenue records are being broken year after year, and the increasing profitability of the large catering chains that dominate along with the ordering platforms, working with rights and decent wages is a "luxury" for the profits of the big conglomerates!

At the same time, workers count their wages every month, while governments and conglomerates gloat over the huge increase in revenue from imported tourism due to inflation. The miracle of tourism is being built, but workers and the popular strata cannot enjoy holidays, the beauties of the seas, mountains, forests, and cultural monuments in our country! Expensive transport tickets, hefty tolls, rising food and catering prices, and fuel accuracy have become prohibitive obstacles for our people to enjoy holidays and recreation. They are paying a golden price for the high VAT tax imposed on them by the ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK governments, implementing the memoranda they voted for.

Workers in Attica have experienced firsthand what tourism development through short-term rental platforms entails. They are confronted with exorbitant rents for inadequate housing, while real estate companies, funds, and property ownership firms profit by purchasing homes at very low prices and utilizing them for Airbnb.

Friends, companions, and comrades, will the people finally benefit from various emblematic projects for capital that are advertised as models of development by New Democracy and have been supported by SYRIZA and PASOK? The people in Attica are paying a fortune for various projects and infrastructures such as the "Great Walk" in the historic center of Athens, Hellenikon, the Coastal Front, and the Faliric Bay. These projects and infrastructures will be exploited for the needs of hotel and tourist groups and are aimed at incoming tourism with expensive wallets, while their use will become more expensive for the working and popular classes. There will be construction of luxury tourist complexes, marinas for luxury yachts, casinos that are the landmarks of gambling in Elliniko and Maroussi, with everything that will accompany them. And closed, very expensive beaches, commercialized areas for rest, recreation, etc., for the great majority of the people. After all, it has not been long since the operation to evict sports clubs and athletes from Agios Kosmas in Elliniko.

This is capitalist development! "Miraculous" for the profits of the few, "nightmare" for the many! This is the growth served by the programs of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, who are competing to see who will be the best servant for the interests of the big groups, either from the position of the government or from the position of the opposition. And this "miracle" for the big business groups has the stamp of all the governments of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, in any composition and with the various supplements. They are committed to the Recovery Fund and the new 350 unpopular preconditions. They are committed to the Commission's guidelines that freeze three-year terms and wages. They are committed to primary surpluses and taxing the people, at the same time as they promote new tax breaks for business groups. New Democracy has the "honor and pride" of being the voice of the big groups, the tour operators, and the big hotel owners. Now, with the logic of the "best manager" and the banner of "stability," it is trying to get the vote of the workers to claim that it has their approval for its unpopular policies. SYRIZA, which is now boasting in words that it will make a strong opposition but in practice will continue with the "we'll settle accounts later," i.e. never, has supported together with ND a series of emblematic anti-people's bills.

Together with ND and PASOK, they handed over Elliniko to Latsis and the big conglomerates, receiving their congratulations. He "sells" sensitivity to tourism workers, but he has only commitments to the big bosses. PASOK abolished heavy and unhealthy work and the specialities of the sector, and is now trying to present itself as if it had not governed this country. Thanks to the laws of ND-Syriza-PASOK, big hotel owners and big catering groups have the 'loopholes' that are useful to them: to avoid the implementation of Collective Labour Agreements, to circumvent the working hours and days off of workers, and to not guarantee humane working, living, and living conditions for seasonal workers.

There are privileges and laws that all governments have passed and implemented so far, such as the generalization of flexible forms of employment, contract work, the abolition of heavy and unhealthy work, the one-off payment at 20 years, the reduction of the duration of the unemployment fund, and the exclusion of thousands of unemployed people during the pandemic. Workers in tourism and catering know very well that one after the other, the regional authorities in Attica, either under the ND majority or previously under SYRIZA and PASOK, have been valuable supports for the governments and big business.

Together, they formulated regional planning that promotes large capitalist investments in Attica, handing over large beaches, mountains, and forests to business groups for exploitation. At the same time, they have left Attica vulnerable to floods and fires and deprived of health facilities. A typical example is East Attica, where tourism is booming with thousands of workers, but there is no public hospital.

So now is the time to capitalize on everyone's achievements. New Democracy, SYRIZA, and PASOK, the parties that have pursued the aforementioned policy for the benefit of the few, committing crimes against the needs, rights, and lives of the many, must be punished at the ballot box. To strengthen the original opponent of their policy, the party that has been at the side of the workers with all its forces, with all its soul, putting obstacles, delaying negative developments that would have otherwise happened long ago, contributing decisively to any conquest. And you in your sector know well who this party is: it is the JCP. Friends, comrades, and companions, the KKE approaches the question of tourism in a fundamentally different light from all the others. It considers tourism to be a human need, a universal people's right directly related to the replenishment of labor power, not a commodity. In capitalist societies, as in our country, it began to be recognized through workers' struggles, to a certain extent, as a result of the influence of the countries that were building socialism, of the hard class struggle and conflict.

But these rights are not enshrined as compulsory and free, despite the fact that the working class creates wealth and deserves to fully benefit from it. Only workers in socialist countries have won such rights, which include reduced working hours, guaranteed free holidays, and reduced retirement age. Domestic tourism with a focus on popular destinations, organized holidays and camps, and specialized networks for children and young people were also available in socialist countries. These rights remain a distant dream for the majority of workers in even the most developed capitalist countries.

The KKE sees the tourism economy as an integral part of another path of development, the socialist economy, in which the sources of wealth production, the enterprises, will have become social, people's property. They will work within the framework of central, scientific planning and under the control of the workers themselves, who will be in power, will be able to elect their representatives in a direct, authentic way and without the current blackmail, and who can be recalled at any time. Most importantly, they will work for the purpose of satisfying social needs, in this case the need for leisure and holidays, and not for the purpose of profit, on the altar of which all our needs are currently sacrificed. Only on this condition can tourism and economic activity be planned and developed for the benefit of the people and the workers in the sector, in proportion and in balance with agricultural and industrial production, energy, water and sewage infrastructure in cities and the countryside, in proportion to the needs of education and training of the workforce, as well as the needs of care and health, in balance with nature, so that social welfare becomes a measure of human intervention in nature, evaluating the positive and negative consequences of its effects. With this power, this path of development proposed by the KKE, tourism will become a right and a bridge of real friendship, acquaintance and cooperation between peoples. Recreation and relaxation will be a guaranteed right of the working class and the popular strata and not an expensive commodity. They will enjoy the beauties of the whole country with modern infrastructure, which they are now unable to do in a large proportion, mainly for economic reasons. Those working in the industry will also enjoy many more days of rest and recreation themselves. The forests, the beaches, the mountains, the cultural heritage of our country will give life and joy because they will belong to the people.

This is the power-government program of the KKE, which we are openly presenting to the people from today. We are ready to serve it from all positions when the people adopt it en masse, decide to follow the path we propose, and come out actively to impose their rights. This is the only truly pro-people perspective, which is another serious reason why the KKE deserves to be strengthened on June 25th, in the face of the permanent sacrifices and uncertainty envisaged by the anti-people's programs of all others. In any case, the KKE does not lose a minute and does not wait impassively until the people adopt its program. Besides, we know well that only in the battle, in daily action and demands, can consciences change. We are stepping forward today in the daily struggle to get immediate relief, prevent anti-worker and anti-people measures, and have new conquests. The stronger the KKE emerges from the June 25th elections, the more deputies it manages to elect, the stronger you, all the workers of our country, will be to improve our lives.

While in other ballots, we will even meet the big hotel owners themselves, the KKE ballots include tried and tested fighters from the food and tourism sector, recognized by all workers who have already proven themselves. Therefore, you know very well what their position will be in Parliament, but also that they will continue to be at the forefront of the workers' struggle in their capacity as MPs, making this struggle stronger. Now is the time when maximum rallying is required to make the KKE stronger everywhere, in the elections of 25 June, in the struggles and demands, in the unions, to break the negative correlation, and to overtake trade union leaderships that serve the employers and the governments.

We know firsthand that wherever the Collective Labor Agreement has been implemented in workplaces, and wherever rights have been won, such as in e-food, and wherever dismissals have been revoked, these were the result of the organized struggle of the workers, with major mobilizations distinguished by their massiveness and militancy, with the forces of the KKE taking the lead.

No government gave them away. On the contrary, they were won by the workers in opposition to the governments of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, which were hostile to our demands. Whatever the workers won, they won because we answered the dilemma "their profits or our lives" by defending our lives militantly and decisively! So in the elections of 25 June, we are voting for our lives by casting the ballot paper of the KKE. Alone with the profits of the hotel owners, the tourist groups, the platforms, and the catering chains. And all of us, with the KKE and the power of the many, to bring the ups and downs! KKE strong, hope is here!
