Friends, companions, and comrades, from here in Peristeri, from these neighborhoods of Western Athens, we cry out with all our strength: We do not accept the barbarity of this system that has turned the Mediterranean seas into a watery grave for thousands of uprooted people. Just as we do not accept the fact that every three months we can count the dead in fires, floods, hospitals, and trains, we will not accept the loss of babies, small children with their mothers locked in a hold at the bottom of the sea... They count profits and losses, we count human lives. We do not compromise because we know that there are causes and culprits, and we are determined to fight them with all our strength until we overthrow them so that we can live as we and our children deserve. This is how it must be done, and this is how it will be done... Refugee migratory flows are not a natural phenomenon to get away with inexpensive humanitarianism, let alone some proposals for managing the consequences. Behind them lies poverty, exploitation produced by this rotten system, capitalism, which everyone, except the KKE, defends and serves, while they only fight over who will sit in the chairs to manage it. Behind it are the big investments that turn the wealth of these countries into a curse for their peoples. There are the imperialist interventions, wars, civil conflicts unleashed and fomented by NATO, the EU, and other imperialist centers.

Some parties of the system and their media ask: "What can we do in Greece to stop the wars?" It's simple! Stop involving our country and our people in interventions. Close the bases from which planes take off to bomb people. Bring back all Greek military personnel who are outside the borders. Abolish military agreements with the US and France that provide assistance to Greek forces in the Sahel. That's all you have to do! But you will not do it because you serve this policy, which aims to strengthen the position of the Greek bourgeoisie that wants bigger pieces for itself from the imperialist booty.

Well, this prey is always soaked in the blood of the people, as was tragically demonstrated the other day outside Pylos. And of course, the crime continues when the uprooted people try to enter fortress Europe. Instead of being welcomed, already from the territory of Turkey and other countries, with asylum examination committees, so that they don't have to risk dangerous journeys, as the KKE proposes, sometimes they run into fences as in Evros, sometimes into FRONTEX, sometimes into the Spanish border guards who murder them, sometimes into one of the NATO frigates called by the governments to guard the Aegean. This fence, in fact, is the subject of a dispute between the Southwest and PASOK over who built it. SYRIZA is also close to it, which is annoyed when someone is photographed with the fence, but otherwise, "it's fine", as Mr Tsipras told us in the debate. Other times, he says, "it's not effective"! But of course, it is effective. That is its purpose, to make it increasingly difficult for uprooted people to cross. That is how the smugglers' tariffs go up, that is how dangerous routes are chosen, that is how we get to the many shipwrecks. And for those who finally manage to arrive, the next part of the drama begins, sometimes with Syriza's Moria, sometimes with the closed structures of the Southwest, where the persecuted find that they have left one barbarism to find themselves in another. And finally, those who are not made for cheap labor take the road back, perhaps to try again later on a new journey of death. This is the barbarity of their policy. This is what all Greek governments have served so far. So let's not pretend that the ruling parties, the parties that present the EU and NATO as the 'common common' home of the peoples, know nothing about the crime. Because they cause even more outrage, even at this hour, by talking about the EU values that are supposedly being violated. This is their European Union, these and its values. And that is why they are all accountable for this crime, which must become an additional voting criterion ahead of next Sunday's ballot box.

Friends, comrades, next Sunday, here in the western districts of Athens, the KKE must be even higher, even stronger! Because that is what our people need, that is what the workers who live in the neighborhoods across the river and work in workplaces all over Attica need. This is what is needed by the small tradesmen of the city who are struggling to survive, by women, by pensioners, by young people who have finished school and are preparing for studies or for work, and others who are already studying.

This is what they need against the next unpopular government of the Southwest, which is preparing to take off again to sweep away what is left of our rights, to burden the people with new bloody surpluses and the new crisis that seems to be just around the corner. We warn them: Beware, don't come with too much momentum, because you will find it somewhere! You may have had an easy time for four years with SYRIZA and PASOK, who voted for 50 and 70% of your bills, respectively, but you did not find it very easy in your attempt to legitimize your unpopular laws in the popular consciences, and you did not find it very easy when you tried to impose silence in the graveyard.

Because the KKE has always been in front of you, with its forces boldly, militantly, and unwaveringly putting the slogan into practice: "Only the people save the people on the road of subversion". It will do the same now! Let SYRIZA and PASOK try to disarm the people by talking about the alleged omnipotence of the Southwest. No government can feel omnipotent when the workers' and people's movement is strong. In this country, there is a strong KKE, a guarantee that the people and their movement will be strong. This is doubly true in Attica, where the KKE is the third party, with 11 deputies! In Attica, where we have fought great battles in recent times and will fight even greater ones. It applies threefold here in the Western Sector, from Agia Varvara to Kamatero. Some people would do well not to forget that. For the map may be painted blue, but somewhere - somewhere that blue is fading, for it is projecting a red, still faint, but red! Proof that a current is being strengthened which questions the dominant policy, its class character, and which is served by the parties of capital and their governments as a whole. Proof that the search for a solution to today's problems through organized struggle, participation in the movement, collective action, is gaining strength.

ND came first because it had the best sponsors, the parties of the center-left and social democracy, which have been predominant in these regions for decades, first PASOK and in recent years SYRIZA. Both have played and marketed the notions of progress and the left for years, but have disappointed the people who trusted them with the policies they implemented. They told and showed them through their actions that "there is no alternative," told them to "bow their heads," to "adapt," and finally to choose the "least bad manager." In the Western Sector of Athens, ND may have come first, and Mitsotakis may be bragging, but with a much smaller percentage than its national one. And now, in next Sunday's ballot, it may get even smaller. There is no reason for the people who voted for it under the blackmail of "stability or instability" and under the influence of a disorienting confrontation between the Southwest and other parties to vote for it again.

Because what will count for the people is not how many more MPs New Democracy will get to vote for its unpopular bills or how many more MPs PASOK and SYRIZA will get to follow this unpopular course! The crucial thing for the people of Peristeri, Haidari, Egaleo, Agia Varvara, and other municipalities is how high the percentage of the KKE will reach, with many thousands of new votes, to ensure the election of the second communist MP, George Perrou. And we know full well that many of those who made other choices at the ballot box in May know what it means for the KKE to thresh, to plow through these neighborhoods with two deputies, to carry their problems, to demand solutions. So let's go for it. Let's get the two deputies in the West Side!

Friends, companions, and comrades, Mr. Mitsotakis has chosen Peristeri as the starting point for this election campaign, drawing on all the audacity and hypocrisy of bourgeois politics. While he was saying that he had done away with the cots at Attiko, 30 patients were on stretchers in corridors the day before the hospital's general duty. And a few days later, three women were dying while waiting for an ambulance that didn't exist. But if there was one, then how would the private sector have a field to invest in and make a profit with the ambulance cards you have seen handed out to you as soon as you step into a hospital? How would the state save money to give packages to business groups, tax shipowners, and pay billions to NATO armaments with the votes of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK? How would the budgetary constraints that Mr. Mitsotakis talks about, and that Mr. Tsipras has told us he will respect, allow for the hiring of as many health workers as needed, based on the outdated hospital organizations? So this is their common agenda, tragically expressed in the health of the people.

And if today they are all obliged to say something, even if only to reassure about their plans, it is because they are obliged by reality itself, but also by the health workers' movement itself, where the KKE has important forces that have not been left behind.

While Mitsotakis was saying from Agios Antonios that he protected the weak from COVID-19, research was released by Panteion University proving that Peristeri had the highest mortality during the pandemic. It doesn't take much brainpower to understand why. Apparently, it's one thing to cocoon in your villa and another to squeeze a family of 5 into a 75 square meter apartment in Anthoupolis. It's one thing to have your children go to the best private school and another to have 25 students taking lessons in containers in the school complex in Horafa. It's one thing to go to your business in your comfortable car and another to squeeze in with 100 other nomads in the buses of Kippouoli and Agios Vasileios. Not to mention the situation that city workers encountered in the workplaces, offices, factories, which of course did not stop working, without protection measures, even in the harshest lockdowns. So here we are, finally, that the virus - or rather the criminal management of the pandemic - did and overdid class "discrimination", contrary to what we were told at the time by government representatives and various willing "experts". So that is why it was then, in those most critical hours, that our people had to "account" for themselves in order to be saved, as a large part of them did, with the KKE in the lead, and not wait to "account afterwards", as SYRIZA told them, only to never be accounted for in the end.

As for what Mr Mitsotakis said about Education, let him take a walk to the University of West Attica to ask the students if everything is working so well. Then, why did they demolish the government GOP by giving it 19% and put the Panspoudastiki first with over 50%? They will surely tell him that this is a university without a student body, that the tragic shortages of professors are preventing the very teaching of courses, and that most faculty have no guaranteed professional rights. Let him take a tour of the public IEK in Peristeri and have the students tell him about the exploitation in the internship. Tell him that unemployment of graduates is at 24% and that 1 in 2 find a job unrelated to their major.

This is why students have been fighting all these years and are fighting together with the members of the Communist Party of Greece and their associations for their right to study and work. They have already achieved a lot.

That is why these districts are popular, and not "popular in quotes" as Mr. Mitsotakis would have us believe. He wants to convince us that with the Southwest in government, suddenly we all have the same opportunities, and whoever did not take advantage of their own opportunities probably has themselves to blame. These districts are indeed popular because the vast majority of people and families who live here struggle every day against difficulties. They did not have everything handed to them, they are exploited, and they rely on each other to get by. However, they are proud because they have not stolen anything from anyone. Everything they have achieved, they have achieved on their own merits. Whether they are refrigeration technicians - as Mr. Mitsotakis once derogatorily referred to them here in Peristeri - or commercial employees, or scientists who studied with a thousand sacrifices from their families, they want to live and contribute with their work, their science, and their art to a better society. A society of justice and solidarity that will protect the weak and those in need.

A society in which opinions like the creepy ones we heard from the MP of the South West about cancer patients and the cost of their treatment will only have a place in museums!

That is why they have no reason to support the same parties that their employers support. These parties swear by capitalist profit and treat our needs as costs. They have governed to date and will form the next government and the next consensual opposition that the system needs just as much. These parties are New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK.

However, they have many reasons to ignore blackmail and vote for KKE.

Friends, here in Peristeri, both older and younger people are aware of the dirty tricks of PASOK. They remember the blackmail tactics used by PASOK to steal votes from the people. Tsipras is now copying these same tricks, claiming that any vote not going to Syriza serves the plan of New Democracy. Leftists and progressives are alarmed by this, just as the voters of SYNASPISM were when PASOK made similar claims. Who knows? Maybe this line is the advice of SYRIZA's campaign manager, the anti-communist Marantzidis, who justifies the Security Battalions. Let SYRIZA bring him here to tell them these reactionary things, where, according to his research opinion, the resistance activity of ELAS is responsible for the deaths during the blockade of Peristeri in July 1944. Let them enjoy him there in Koumoundourou. Although it seems that they were rather jealous of the "glory" of that inglorious Paparachenko.

But here, the leftists are proud of our people's history and cannot tolerate these reactionary views.

But Tsipras continues this by taking a direct shot at the KKE, saying that it makes no difference for a party to go from 7 to 8%, while what matters is that SYRIZA's percentage rises. What our ancestors used to say applies here: "The hare has eaten the fern, the evil of his head"...

Because the workers in our country know that the exact opposite is true. If the KKE receives 8% or more, it means that more communist deputies will be elected who will support them inside and outside of parliament.

Taking SYRIZA from 20% to 21% means electing 1-2 more MPs who will vote for Mitsotakis' emblematic bills and undermine the struggles. Behind this attitude of Tsipras, one can see the hostility of SYRIZA itself towards the workers' movement, in the reorganization of which the KKE is leading the way. See the anti-worker abstraction of Hatzidakis. Tsipras promised to abolish it, speaking recently to his party's trade unionists. However, SYRIZA and many of these trade unionists have given their best to implement this law. At the beginning, Syriza was talking about "deviation from EU normality", when the regulation of working time, i.e. the abolition of the 8-hour working day, is exactly the direction of the EU. Then it acknowledged that it also has "positive points". When the huge strikes were being organized to get the law withdrawn, Syriza officials said that it would be passed anyway, and therefore workers had no reason to strike, but only to wait for the elections. Then it went to parliament and passed half of the articles. And today, he is leading the way with his few forces in the unions and other bodies to implement electronic voting, electronic registers, to comply with the anti-austerity provisions. Let everyone ask themselves: Is this the way to put a dam on the alleged omnipotence of the Southwest? Or is it paving the way for it to continue its crushing of workers?

Really, does SYRIZA know anything about ND's first-ever victory in the Municipality of Peristeri? How did its official support for the iconic mayor of the right, Mr. Pachaturidis, who was campaigning for the ND candidates in the Western Sector at the same time, affect this development? So let them stick to what they know. What opposition will SYRIZA and PASOK give to the ND government here in Peristeri, since when Mitsotakis visits the city, he will be greeted by Mr. Pachaturidis and his municipal councillors who will be members of both the ND and SYRIZA and PASOK? We are talking about grotesque situations! However, things are very serious here because we have difficult times ahead of us for our people, and we must take timely action, all of us. We call on the thousands of people here in Peristeri who followed SYRIZA in the past years, and perhaps other forces later on, to now see the truth in their faces. To think, to see the enormous responsibility of SYRIZA for the victory of ND in 2019 and today. To consider the damage that this party has done and continues to do to the popular movement, to the consciences of the people, to the cause of progress as a whole, that is, the struggle for a better life for us and our children! We look you in the eye, as the communists have always looked you in the eye, and we say to you: Do not give them any more tolerance. Because tolerance eventually becomes complicity. Unfortunately, they have chosen sides, and there is no hope of returning.

Make your decisions now. Follow the example of thousands of people who voted for the KKE for the first time on May 21st. We know that the rise of the KKE was the only positive element of the election result that made you smile and cheer up, because you also saw that the KKE's share was a positive step in the overall negative trend. So come on, let's do more. Let's make the smiles on people's faces even wider.

We are also addressing popular people, militants, who in the past followed PASOK and at some point abandoned it. We tell them that today's PASOK has not changed in any way since then. It is still the same party that betrayed your hopes, that voted for three memoranda of understanding, that voted twice in coalition with the New Democracy. Besides, up until the day before the elections, it declared itself ready to do it again. It is the party that identified itself with the scandals and fraud that made honest workers and people turn their backs on it. It is the party whose forces have done and continue to do the most damage to the labor movement by means of cunning, by means of goons, by putting the employers themselves in the unions and, above all, by the line of subordination to the aims of capital. PASOK is the leadership of the GSEE, which was sunbathing and discussing investment products in Kavouri, on the day when unions and federations were fighting the battle of the general strike after the crime in Tempe. This is PASOK, and it is not changing! We also appeal to those who have chosen or are thinking of choosing one of the so-called small parties. Be careful: We have seen the play before. The system has a habit of inflating such formations out of thin air to get them to do the job it wants and then withdrawing them. So many have passed through the House, and today no one knows where they are: DIMAR, LAOS, Potami, the Centrist Union, and most recently Mera25. Now they are doing the same with the party of Konstantopoulou, who has a heavy past from the period of deceiving the people in the first half of 2015. Deception which she herself served from her position as Speaker of the Parliament. After all, she is the originator of the phrase that the abolition of the memoranda, which SYRIZA said during the pre-election campaign, was a "figure of speech"! It was not a figure of speech, however, the proposal for a law submitted by the KKE for the abolition of the memoranda and probably Mrs. Zoe still has it locked away in a drawer because she never brought it to the Parliament... And since no one has seen it anywhere, in any struggle, in any of the trials that our people have gone through for 8 years, now the mainstream media are trying to pass it on to us as an alternative, even as an anti-systemic option. Mercy!

Friends, comrades, and companions, in the one week remaining, we will work day and night, without counting fatigue. Now we are evaluating the results of the effort we have been making for many months to strengthen the KKE. The first step was taken on May 21, but it will remain in abeyance if it is not confirmed by the vote for the JKE next Sunday. Ultimately, only this vote will count and bring results that will follow us for the next four years. The vote next Sunday will determine whether the people of Western Athens will finally send both Vivi Daga and George Perros to Parliament, two tried and tested fighters who will become the voice of the workers, professionals, women, and youth of the region. With the ballot in hand, let's go find everyone. Let's overcome all difficulties, objective and subjective, to ensure that not a single vote is lost to the KKE. It is worth every effort, every sacrifice, for each and every person to ensure their vote for the Party. Abstention will not be on our side in the difficult times ahead. So let us go to the remaining days and hours with anger, heart, and mind, to give greater strength to our power! JKE strong, hope is here!
