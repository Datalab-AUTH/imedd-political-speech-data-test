Friends, companions, and comrades, Mr. Mitsotakis has chosen Peristeri as the starting point for this election campaign, drawing on all the audacity and hypocrisy of bourgeois politics. While he was saying that he had done away with the cots at Attiko, 30 patients were on stretchers in corridors the day before the hospital's general duty. And a few days later, three women were dying while waiting for an ambulance that didn't exist. But if there was one, then how would the private sector have a field to invest in and make a profit with the ambulance cards you have seen handed out to you as soon as you step into a hospital? How would the state save money to give packages to business groups, tax shipowners, and pay billions to NATO armaments with the votes of ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK? How would the budgetary constraints that Mr. Mitsotakis talks about, and that Mr. Tsipras has told us he will respect, allow for the hiring of as many health workers as needed, based on the outdated hospital organizations? So this is their common agenda, tragically expressed in the health of the people.
