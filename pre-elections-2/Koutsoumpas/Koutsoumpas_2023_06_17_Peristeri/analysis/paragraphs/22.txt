Taking SYRIZA from 20% to 21% means electing 1-2 more MPs who will vote for Mitsotakis' emblematic bills and undermine the struggles. Behind this attitude of Tsipras, one can see the hostility of SYRIZA itself towards the workers' movement, in the reorganization of which the KKE is leading the way. See the anti-worker abstraction of Hatzidakis. Tsipras promised to abolish it, speaking recently to his party's trade unionists. However, SYRIZA and many of these trade unionists have given their best to implement this law. At the beginning, Syriza was talking about "deviation from EU normality", when the regulation of working time, i.e. the abolition of the 8-hour working day, is exactly the direction of the EU. Then it acknowledged that it also has "positive points". When the huge strikes were being organized to get the law withdrawn, Syriza officials said that it would be passed anyway, and therefore workers had no reason to strike, but only to wait for the elections. Then it went to parliament and passed half of the articles. And today, he is leading the way with his few forces in the unions and other bodies to implement electronic voting, electronic registers, to comply with the anti-austerity provisions. Let everyone ask themselves: Is this the way to put a dam on the alleged omnipotence of the Southwest? Or is it paving the way for it to continue its crushing of workers?
