ND came first because it had the best sponsors, the parties of the center-left and social democracy, which have been predominant in these regions for decades, first PASOK and in recent years SYRIZA. Both have played and marketed the notions of progress and the left for years, but have disappointed the people who trusted them with the policies they implemented. They told and showed them through their actions that "there is no alternative," told them to "bow their heads," to "adapt," and finally to choose the "least bad manager." In the Western Sector of Athens, ND may have come first, and Mitsotakis may be bragging, but with a much smaller percentage than its national one. And now, in next Sunday's ballot, it may get even smaller. There is no reason for the people who voted for it under the blackmail of "stability or instability" and under the influence of a disorienting confrontation between the Southwest and other parties to vote for it again.
