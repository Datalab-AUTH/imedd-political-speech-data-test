Friends, comrades, and companions, in the one week remaining, we will work day and night, without counting fatigue. Now we are evaluating the results of the effort we have been making for many months to strengthen the KKE. The first step was taken on May 21, but it will remain in abeyance if it is not confirmed by the vote for the JKE next Sunday. Ultimately, only this vote will count and bring results that will follow us for the next four years. The vote next Sunday will determine whether the people of Western Athens will finally send both Vivi Daga and George Perros to Parliament, two tried and tested fighters who will become the voice of the workers, professionals, women, and youth of the region. With the ballot in hand, let's go find everyone. Let's overcome all difficulties, objective and subjective, to ensure that not a single vote is lost to the KKE. It is worth every effort, every sacrifice, for each and every person to ensure their vote for the Party. Abstention will not be on our side in the difficult times ahead. So let us go to the remaining days and hours with anger, heart, and mind, to give greater strength to our power! JKE strong, hope is here!
