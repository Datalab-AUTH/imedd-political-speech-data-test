That is why these districts are popular, and not "popular in quotes" as Mr. Mitsotakis would have us believe. He wants to convince us that with the Southwest in government, suddenly we all have the same opportunities, and whoever did not take advantage of their own opportunities probably has themselves to blame. These districts are indeed popular because the vast majority of people and families who live here struggle every day against difficulties. They did not have everything handed to them, they are exploited, and they rely on each other to get by. However, they are proud because they have not stolen anything from anyone. Everything they have achieved, they have achieved on their own merits. Whether they are refrigeration technicians - as Mr. Mitsotakis once derogatorily referred to them here in Peristeri - or commercial employees, or scientists who studied with a thousand sacrifices from their families, they want to live and contribute with their work, their science, and their art to a better society. A society of justice and solidarity that will protect the weak and those in need.
