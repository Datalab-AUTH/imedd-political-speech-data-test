This is what they need against the next unpopular government of the Southwest, which is preparing to take off again to sweep away what is left of our rights, to burden the people with new bloody surpluses and the new crisis that seems to be just around the corner. We warn them: Beware, don't come with too much momentum, because you will find it somewhere! You may have had an easy time for four years with SYRIZA and PASOK, who voted for 50 and 70% of your bills, respectively, but you did not find it very easy in your attempt to legitimize your unpopular laws in the popular consciences, and you did not find it very easy when you tried to impose silence in the graveyard.
