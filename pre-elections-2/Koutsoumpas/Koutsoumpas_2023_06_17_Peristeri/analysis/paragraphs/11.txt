While Mitsotakis was saying from Agios Antonios that he protected the weak from COVID-19, research was released by Panteion University proving that Peristeri had the highest mortality during the pandemic. It doesn't take much brainpower to understand why. Apparently, it's one thing to cocoon in your villa and another to squeeze a family of 5 into a 75 square meter apartment in Anthoupolis. It's one thing to have your children go to the best private school and another to have 25 students taking lessons in containers in the school complex in Horafa. It's one thing to go to your business in your comfortable car and another to squeeze in with 100 other nomads in the buses of Kippouoli and Agios Vasileios. Not to mention the situation that city workers encountered in the workplaces, offices, factories, which of course did not stop working, without protection measures, even in the harshest lockdowns. So here we are, finally, that the virus - or rather the criminal management of the pandemic - did and overdid class "discrimination", contrary to what we were told at the time by government representatives and various willing "experts". So that is why it was then, in those most critical hours, that our people had to "account" for themselves in order to be saved, as a large part of them did, with the KKE in the lead, and not wait to "account afterwards", as SYRIZA told them, only to never be accounted for in the end.
