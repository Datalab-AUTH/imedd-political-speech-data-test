As for what Mr Mitsotakis said about Education, let him take a walk to the University of West Attica to ask the students if everything is working so well. Then, why did they demolish the government GOP by giving it 19% and put the Panspoudastiki first with over 50%? They will surely tell him that this is a university without a student body, that the tragic shortages of professors are preventing the very teaching of courses, and that most faculty have no guaranteed professional rights. Let him take a tour of the public IEK in Peristeri and have the students tell him about the exploitation in the internship. Tell him that unemployment of graduates is at 24% and that 1 in 2 find a job unrelated to their major.
