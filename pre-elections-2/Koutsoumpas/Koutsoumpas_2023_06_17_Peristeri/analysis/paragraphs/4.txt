Friends, comrades, next Sunday, here in the western districts of Athens, the KKE must be even higher, even stronger! Because that is what our people need, that is what the workers who live in the neighborhoods across the river and work in workplaces all over Attica need. This is what is needed by the small tradesmen of the city who are struggling to survive, by women, by pensioners, by young people who have finished school and are preparing for studies or for work, and others who are already studying.
