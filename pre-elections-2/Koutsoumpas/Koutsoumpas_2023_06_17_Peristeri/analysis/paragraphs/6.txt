Because the KKE has always been in front of you, with its forces boldly, militantly, and unwaveringly putting the slogan into practice: "Only the people save the people on the road of subversion". It will do the same now! Let SYRIZA and PASOK try to disarm the people by talking about the alleged omnipotence of the Southwest. No government can feel omnipotent when the workers' and people's movement is strong. In this country, there is a strong KKE, a guarantee that the people and their movement will be strong. This is doubly true in Attica, where the KKE is the third party, with 11 deputies! In Attica, where we have fought great battles in recent times and will fight even greater ones. It applies threefold here in the Western Sector, from Agia Varvara to Kamatero. Some people would do well not to forget that. For the map may be painted blue, but somewhere - somewhere that blue is fading, for it is projecting a red, still faint, but red! Proof that a current is being strengthened which questions the dominant policy, its class character, and which is served by the parties of capital and their governments as a whole. Proof that the search for a solution to today's problems through organized struggle, participation in the movement, collective action, is gaining strength.
