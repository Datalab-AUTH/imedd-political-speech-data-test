Some parties of the system and their media ask: "What can we do in Greece to stop the wars?" It's simple! Stop involving our country and our people in interventions. Close the bases from which planes take off to bomb people. Bring back all Greek military personnel who are outside the borders. Abolish military agreements with the US and France that provide assistance to Greek forces in the Sahel. That's all you have to do! But you will not do it because you serve this policy, which aims to strengthen the position of the Greek bourgeoisie that wants bigger pieces for itself from the imperialist booty.
