Friends, companions, and comrades, from here in Peristeri, from these neighborhoods of Western Athens, we cry out with all our strength: We do not accept the barbarity of this system that has turned the Mediterranean seas into a watery grave for thousands of uprooted people. Just as we do not accept the fact that every three months we can count the dead in fires, floods, hospitals, and trains, we will not accept the loss of babies, small children with their mothers locked in a hold at the bottom of the sea... They count profits and losses, we count human lives. We do not compromise because we know that there are causes and culprits, and we are determined to fight them with all our strength until we overthrow them so that we can live as we and our children deserve. This is how it must be done, and this is how it will be done... Refugee migratory flows are not a natural phenomenon to get away with inexpensive humanitarianism, let alone some proposals for managing the consequences. Behind them lies poverty, exploitation produced by this rotten system, capitalism, which everyone, except the KKE, defends and serves, while they only fight over who will sit in the chairs to manage it. Behind it are the big investments that turn the wealth of these countries into a curse for their peoples. There are the imperialist interventions, wars, civil conflicts unleashed and fomented by NATO, the EU, and other imperialist centers.
