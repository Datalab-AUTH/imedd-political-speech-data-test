Friends, here in Peristeri, both older and younger people are aware of the dirty tricks of PASOK. They remember the blackmail tactics used by PASOK to steal votes from the people. Tsipras is now copying these same tricks, claiming that any vote not going to Syriza serves the plan of New Democracy. Leftists and progressives are alarmed by this, just as the voters of SYNASPISM were when PASOK made similar claims. Who knows? Maybe this line is the advice of SYRIZA's campaign manager, the anti-communist Marantzidis, who justifies the Security Battalions. Let SYRIZA bring him here to tell them these reactionary things, where, according to his research opinion, the resistance activity of ELAS is responsible for the deaths during the blockade of Peristeri in July 1944. Let them enjoy him there in Koumoundourou. Although it seems that they were rather jealous of the "glory" of that inglorious Paparachenko.
