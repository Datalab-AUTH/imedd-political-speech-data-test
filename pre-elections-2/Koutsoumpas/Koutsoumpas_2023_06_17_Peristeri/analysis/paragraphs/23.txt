Really, does SYRIZA know anything about ND's first-ever victory in the Municipality of Peristeri? How did its official support for the iconic mayor of the right, Mr. Pachaturidis, who was campaigning for the ND candidates in the Western Sector at the same time, affect this development? So let them stick to what they know. What opposition will SYRIZA and PASOK give to the ND government here in Peristeri, since when Mitsotakis visits the city, he will be greeted by Mr. Pachaturidis and his municipal councillors who will be members of both the ND and SYRIZA and PASOK? We are talking about grotesque situations! However, things are very serious here because we have difficult times ahead of us for our people, and we must take timely action, all of us. We call on the thousands of people here in Peristeri who followed SYRIZA in the past years, and perhaps other forces later on, to now see the truth in their faces. To think, to see the enormous responsibility of SYRIZA for the victory of ND in 2019 and today. To consider the damage that this party has done and continues to do to the popular movement, to the consciences of the people, to the cause of progress as a whole, that is, the struggle for a better life for us and our children! We look you in the eye, as the communists have always looked you in the eye, and we say to you: Do not give them any more tolerance. Because tolerance eventually becomes complicity. Unfortunately, they have chosen sides, and there is no hope of returning.
