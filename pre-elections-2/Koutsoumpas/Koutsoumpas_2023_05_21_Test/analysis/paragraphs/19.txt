But it would be good for Mera25, when it says the word "rupture", to open a dictionary to see what it means, because rupture and oaths of loyalty to the Commission, to the EU, do not go together. Because a break with the system cannot, will not and will never be made by someone who refuses to call this system by its name and even runs to protect it now that many people, especially young people, seem to be starting to question it, with Mr Varoufakis telling them that in Greece we do not exactly have capitalism, but something else, which only he knows! Beware of the election mischief-makers, then! Because they, too, are on the same track as the others. So let's leave them alone to do their own thing. We're all against them, with a strong JCD. Alone, they all have only one concern, to fill the coffers of the monopolies and business groups with profits.
