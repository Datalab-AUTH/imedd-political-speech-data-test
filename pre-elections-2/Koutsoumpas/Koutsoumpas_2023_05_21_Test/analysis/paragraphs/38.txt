So now JCE! Thousands of new votes to give a big blow to this system. Not a single vote must be lost for the KKE. Let's turn election Sunday into a red rushing river from coast to coast across the country! We can, we will, and we will do it alone and all of us! Because only the people save the people on the road to overthrow and on Monday we need a KKE even much stronger to pave the way at last for the great, the beautiful, the shocking! Hello! Good strength! Good health to all! We expect nothing from all of them. We are taking lives into our own hands. We're going to the polls on Sunday at all the polling stations and we're throwing a bite of JPC. KKE strong, hope is here!
