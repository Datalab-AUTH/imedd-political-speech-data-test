This absurdity that we are experiencing has a name: It is called capitalism, the system we live under that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, that puts its profits above our lives! We are against this old, rotten, now historically outdated system and we will overthrow it together with the people to bring a bright tomorrow. All this needs the people as protagonists in the developments, not just voters of governments, ready to become masters of the wealth they produce. In this governance, therefore, the KKE will be in front with all its forces.
