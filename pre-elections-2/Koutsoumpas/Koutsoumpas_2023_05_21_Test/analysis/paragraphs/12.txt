Even on the issue of professional contributions, ND and SYRIZA are practicing an unacceptable blackmail: either high contributions in order to get a relatively decent pension in old age, or lower contributions in order to finally get starvation pensions. However, the immediate demand of all employed professionals, of all pensioners, is that all anti-insurance laws be repealed here and now and that generous increases be given here and now, for decent pensions. This demand is supported by the KKE in all tones.
