We can now, on the last day of the election period, and after a very long political excursion throughout the country, say that we can see this everywhere. All of Greece saw it in the images of our magnificent, huge rally the day before yesterday in Syntagma. We see it here today, in this great mass of people, in the rally in Piraeus. There are too many people who today are thinking of voting for the KKE, in fact they have decided to do so! We say to them: Don't hesitate, don't put it off until later, don't give in to any last-minute blackmail, no more wasted time! On Sunday at the ballot box, everyone will be alone at the screen, confronted with their conscience. The choice he will make will be, with anger, with heart and mind, to vote for the KKE. If he does this, he will come out of the screen with his head held high, in no doubt that he will soon have to "cut off his hand", confident that his choice will not be contradicted. He will know that the vote he gave will remain as he gave it, since the JCP will not, post-election, do anything other than what it said during the election. Really, is there anyone or anyone who will vote for another party who can say that with certainty?
