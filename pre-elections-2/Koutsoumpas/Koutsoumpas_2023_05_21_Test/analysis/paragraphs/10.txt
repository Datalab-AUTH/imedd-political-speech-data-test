They will stand with the workers against the impunity of big business, with young parents, for a better life for them and their children. That's the kind of MPs our people need today. Fighters. Ready, together with the members, cadres, friends of the KKE, to turn everything upside down for the life we really deserve and not dealers of business interests, like those who are mobbing the ballots of other parties. So, therefore, no hesitation! Only a vote for the KKE is a vote that the people will find the next day with them, not against them!
