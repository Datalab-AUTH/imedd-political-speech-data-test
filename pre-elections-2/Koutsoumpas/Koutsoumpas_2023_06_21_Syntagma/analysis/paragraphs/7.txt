So, just as the workers have no reason to further strengthen ND, they have no reason to scatter their votes to the parties of the consensual, systemic opposition, such as SYRIZA and PASOK. They will continue to vote for one of Mitsotakis' bills after another, and stand back in all critical moments, as social democracy has always done. Neither do the parties created by the media establishment, such as Mrs. Konstantopoulou's with her sinful past, have anything to offer our people and their struggles. Nor, of course, do the various far-right formations that are being pushed to enter Parliament.
