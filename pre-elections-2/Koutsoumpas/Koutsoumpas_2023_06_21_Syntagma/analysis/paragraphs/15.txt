This solidarity is being abused by Mr. Tsipras. He claims that from 2015-2019, our country was a model in the refugee issue and a symbol of humanity. But can any left-wing, progressive person really bear to listen to such things? Especially when we have experienced the horrors of Moria, a modern concentration camp where thousands of people and children were crammed in and struggled with death every day? And when we have experienced so many shipwrecks, especially during that period? Who can forget the image of little Ailan on the sands of Halicarnassus? Yes, Mr. Tsipras, our people have become synonymous with humanity, but your government and the EU that you worship have become synonymous with inhumanity. The government of Mr. Mitsotakis today also owes answers to questions about the shipwreck.
