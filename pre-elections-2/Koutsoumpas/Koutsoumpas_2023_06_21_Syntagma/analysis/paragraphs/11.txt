No MP in Piraeus asked what the workers in Perama voted for when they were in the zone where another worker was dying from the very first moment. Why? Because a collective agreement from 2017, with half of the pages dealing with safety measures, was not made mandatory by either the Syriza government or the ND government. But the workers themselves achieved this with their union, a 48-hour strike, and the communists and KKE deputies in Piraeus in the front line.
