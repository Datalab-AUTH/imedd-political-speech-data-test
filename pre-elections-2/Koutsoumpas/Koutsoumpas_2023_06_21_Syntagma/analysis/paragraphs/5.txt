Because they will find this vote against them tomorrow when the big employers ask them to put more backbone to save the company's profits, and when they refuse to sign a collective agreement. They will find it against them when the banks and funds squeeze the people's families, and when New Democracy implements one unpopular precondition after another of the Recovery Fund, loading new burdens on the people to save the groups and banks in the new crisis. This is the vote that the workers will find against them when the government of the Southwest puts into practice the Commission's suggestions for new cuts in social spending, new taxes on the people to ease the burden on capital, and frozen wages and pensions until further notice. They will find it against them when the Southwest, with Mitsotakis' personal supervision, builds the New NHS SA and promotes the Universities SA by abolishing Article 16 with the consent of SYRIZA and PASOK. The workers will find this vote for ND against them when it involves us even more in the massacre in Ukraine alongside NATO and the USA, who are already preparing the new dangerous developments in Greek-Turkish relations.
