And these hardships were inflicted on you by the workers, the working class, the professional farmers and professionals, the youth, all those who took part in the great struggles of the past years. With the KKE in front, to put the slogan into practice everywhere: "Only the people save the people on the road to revolution!" It will do the same now. And let SYRIZA and PASOK continue to pave the way for ND, even now during the election campaign, talking about the alleged omnipotence of its government. No bourgeois government can feel omnipotent when the workers' - people's movement is strong. And in this country, there is a strong JCP, a guarantee that the people and their movement will be strong. We, of course, sometimes forget what it means to have a communist party in a country with strong ties within the people. We were reminded of this by the pioneering French trade unionist workers who welcomed us to the magnificent strikes in Paris, and we welcomed them here on May Day. They left talking about the importance of the existence and action of a strong communist party oriented to the workers' movement, to the perspective of the struggle. We were reminded of this by the president of the Amazon union who, from here in Greece, sent a message to the American workers about the need to found a workers' party in their own country. Well, yes! Hope lies in the struggle of the peoples, a struggle that grows stronger inspired, harvested by the strengthening of communists. Let us send this message to the whole world by strengthening the KKE at the ballot box on Sunday.
