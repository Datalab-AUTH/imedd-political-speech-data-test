No, of course not in Kozani, where photovoltaic panels reach the backyards of houses and the forces of repression enforce the rights of investors, was the MP of the KKE, a young girl, silenced. On the contrary, she stepped forward in the mobilizations, together with the residents, and succeeded in stopping the work. The question, of course, is not what the KKE is doing, because the KKE is doing everything in its power. The question is what the green development people, Syriza, and PASOK are doing. What are they doing? They are just playing the suckers when they don't vote for green taxes so that some green energy groups can profit again.
