In fact, SYRIZA executives have the nerve to say that if the KKE gets 1% more, it doesn't matter, unlike their party getting 1-2% more. Since they gave 41% to ND, they have dedicated this whole election period to figuring out how to cut something from KKE. They want to hide, but the dirty tricks they copied from PASOK won't let them. They are clearly judging by looking at themselves in the mirror. They weigh votes by their own criteria that are subservient to the system. They are not only trying to hit the KKE, but also trying to trip up those who feel left-wing and progressive. They are doing everything they can to prevent ordinary people from making a radical and progressive choice, which is only the KKE. The truth is, it will make no positive difference to the people if PASOK has one point more, and it will make no positive difference to the people if SYRIZA has one point more. It is exactly the opposite. Increasing the number of MPs who will continue on the path that made the New Democracy party stronger, namely the path of consensual opposition, convergence on strategic issues, and voting for dozens of unpopular bills, will be a negative development.
