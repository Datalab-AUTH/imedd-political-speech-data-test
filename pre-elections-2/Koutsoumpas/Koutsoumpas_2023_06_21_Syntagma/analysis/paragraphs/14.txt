But on Sunday, we will all go to the ballot box with great anger. For the hundreds of souls lost off the coast of Pylos. For this new crime of the European Union and its policies, of the governments, of the parties that shaped and implemented them. For this new crime, in the final analysis, of the bloody system of exploitation. They all sowed bombs and poverty in a number of countries, set up bases on Greek soil for war planes to take off from here, and then raised fortresses to prevent their victims from getting through. Because we know that these crimes, like the uprooting of people themselves, have causes and culprits. It is not a natural phenomenon, as all the crocodiles who have been crying again make it out to be. Because we cannot listen to Mr Mitsotakis saying that the policy of repression is humanitarian, because he says that the fewer boats there are in the Aegean, the less likely they are to sink. And he said this boldly a few days after the tragedy. Because we are with the uprooted because they are our class brothers and sisters, not because the hotel owners and the strawberry farmers of Manolada are short of cheap labor, as Mitsotakis, Tsipras, and Varoufakis say. And like the migrants themselves, like the young people who have emigrated from Greece, we prefer that people can live with dignity and security in their own country, with their families and their own people. This people has shown its solidarity many times, which has been reflected in touching moments and figures of our people. Such as the three grandmothers in Lesvos who fed milk to the refugee children or the baker in Kos who distributed free bread every day to the persecuted. The people of Kalamata did the same now, running to the port to help the rescued people as they could.
