Fortunately, in Greece, there is a real choice for the people - a choice of 100% popular, militant opposition - because there is the KKE! You know this well. That is why you are trying to silence our voice with blockades, fines, and even legal proceedings against our cadres who stand in front of the struggles of the people and the youth. You are tiring in vain. These things do not work here. You do not get off so easily with us, neither you who dream of omnipotence nor you who dream of a reconstitution of the two-party system. The rotten system you serve doesn't get off that easy with us either.
