Friends, companions, and comrades, this big red, red-hot gathering of people and youth here in Athens confirms that the positive step taken in May can now be a leap forward. And this is the most optimistic, the most hopeful message! Because the ballot on Sunday may bring out the next anti-people's government, but the crucial thing for the people is that it will also bring out a 100% militant, popular opposition. And this is only the KKE, even stronger, more powerful. You see, tonight here in Syntagma Square, there is not only the central election rally of the KKE. Tonight here is the first big demonstration of the people of Athens against the new government of the New Democracy. Here is the voice of the 15% of Kaisariani, the 13.5% of Nea Ionia, the 13% of Petroupolis, the 12% of Kokkinia, the 11% of Perama, the 16% of Aspropyrgos. It is the voice of all those who have once again made the KKE the third power in Attica. And they will do it again by raising its rates everywhere.
