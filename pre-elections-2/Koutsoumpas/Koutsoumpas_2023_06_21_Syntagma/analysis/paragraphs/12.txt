No candidate, no KKE member, no member of any party asked families who they voted for in order to prevent dozens of auctions and evictions that still occur today. These auctions began after the Supreme Court decision implementing the Syriza law that transferred people's loans to creditors. Ultimately, the best protection against these auctions, which even Syriza's electronic auctions cannot overcome, is the struggle and solidarity of the people.
