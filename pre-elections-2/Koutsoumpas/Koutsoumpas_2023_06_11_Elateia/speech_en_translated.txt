Our message is being conveyed here today in Elatia. In the May elections, we took a step forward with the significant strengthening of the KKE here in my homeland of Fthiotida, with my election as a member of parliament. We set ourselves the goal of increasing the percentage of the KKE and electing a communist MP in Fthiotida, and we succeeded. Now let's aim for the next one, let's make the leap. Let's strengthen the KKE even more, especially in the towns and villages where working people, breadwinners who fight the daily battle for survival, reside. So let's go strong in the remaining days, so that even more people will arrive with the KKE ballot paper at the ballot box on June 25th, to secure the parliamentary seat in Fthiotida, which you all know will be a strength for the people of the region.

Of course, Mitsotakis is now continuing the blackmail story, saying "self-reliance or elections in August". He is doing it to grab as many votes as he can, but everyone understands that the margins are narrowing. In any case, there will be a government: either an independent government of the Southwest or a cooperation with some other willing parties, but there will be one. They have ensured this with the unfair electoral law they have made, which steals parliamentary seats from other parties and gives them as a bonus to the first party.

Therefore, in order to keep our seats, the KKE must be further strengthened. The crucial thing for the people is who will be against this government.

And let Mitsotakis try again to mislead by saying, "In the elections, we vote for the government and not for the opposition."

In the upcoming elections, the crucial factor for the people is who will oppose the anti-people's government from the perspective of the working people's interests. The KKE is the only 100% militant, working people's opposition. There is no need to list what the KKE did during the four years of the ND government, when SYRIZA and PASOK voted 50% each for its anti-people's bills and 70% each for its anti-people's bills. It is unnecessary to say who revealed the unpopular content of the laws of the South-West to the workers and fought for them not to be passed or implemented when SYRIZA and PASOK were backing the South-West and disorienting the people. It is also unnecessary to say who stepped forward in the struggles so that the workers, the breadwinner farmers, and professionals would not have to pay the bills in all the difficult periods, but would also gain respite and be able to survive. Sometimes with the pandemic, sometimes with the crisis that came afterwards, sometimes with the precision and energy poverty, sometimes with the war that continues with the participation of our country, SYRIZA and PASOK were limited to cockfighting in the Parliament, and the KKE fought the battle everywhere in the towns and villages for our people to stand upright.

We are doing the same thing these days with the members and cadres of the KKE, as well as its deputies. Some of them may have only been deputies for a day, but they were there where the slogan was being put into practice: "Only the people can save the people."

And this is what happened in the Shipbuilding and Repair Zone in Perama, where a worker was killed because there were no safety measures. The collective labour agreement signed by the union provides for such measures to be compulsory, but neither the ND nor SYRIZA government made it so. We did it.

It happened in Kalamia, Kozani, where the residents of a village managed to stop the installation of a huge photovoltaic park that literally surrounds their village. And we continue.

It also happened that we wasted no time in taking initiatives everywhere to prevent innocent lives from being ruined again by tragic shortcomings in the public health system, as in Kos, Nea Makri, and Halkidiki. And we will not back down.

It also happened in many neighborhoods where, together with other workers, friends, and neighbors, we prevented families from being thrown out on the street due to bank auctions and foreclosures. We succeeded.

This is where we will deposit the electoral power that the people will give us in the struggles of the working people. A strong KKE means a strong people and their movement.

Already the fairy tales of stable growth for all with lower taxes, higher wages, and reduced inequalities have begun, and other tales of the Hallimae. Let them come here to tell it in Elatia, in Fthiotida, in a rural area that is experiencing the largest population decline in a decade, over 23%, mainly due to the blow to rural incomes. And yet we are talking about an area with a truly fertile plain with enormous productive potential between two mountain ranges, Kallidromos and Parnassos.

Instead of building hydroelectric dams to irrigate organic farmers for free and produce energy for the region, energy conglomerates are destroying thousands of acres of highly productive land to install photovoltaic panels. This results in the energy conglomerates getting rich, while farmers struggle to afford irrigation and the people of the region pay high prices for electricity and cannot meet their needs.

Everyone knows, both old and young, that important crops such as tobacco, which kept the region and countryside alive, have been devalued and abandoned due to CAP and EU guidelines.

Let them come here and say these big fake words when the health centre does not even remotely meet the health needs of the region due to understaffing, and the supposed regional clinics are also understaffed.

Here, shops and small businesses are closing one after another due to sluggishness. Farmers and workers cannot afford to see their incomes decrease, as they cannot meet their basic needs because of inexactness and tax evasion.

Let them come and say this here in Elatia, an area with archaeological sites of great value that are on the verge of complete abandonment and devaluation.

Here in an area where the railway line passes, the services that stop and serve the residents are few and far between. The tickets are very expensive, and of course, everyone thinks that the "new Tempe" is lurking. So, in order not to mourn new victims as in the tragedy of Tempe, here in this earthquake-prone region, it is literally a matter of life and death to take anti-seismic protection measures. The stability of public buildings has not been checked, etc.

We were reminded of this yesterday by the earthquake in the Atalanti area, where we suddenly started reading about the big Atalanti fault and whether it has been activated. What are they waiting for to proceed with the seismic reinforcement of the country? How long before they compromise the protection of human life and remove it from their government programs?

This applies to all parties, including ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK, who argue about whether their programs are costed. In reality, the needs of the people have been excluded from their programs, and only the profits of the few conglomerates are considered.

Tsipras admitted that the 15,000 recruitments in the NHS that he has in his program are much less than what is actually needed based on the hospital organizations, but there are limited budgetary possibilities.

Only that they exist for the workers, the breadwinner farmers, and professionals and not for the profits of the industrialists, the shipowners, and the big businessmen. When SYRIZA and PASOK give time to the government of the South-West to gain momentum and continue its all-out attack on the people, the KKE will fight within the people to organize its counter-attack because the best defense against the attack is the counter-attack. That is why the workers, the working people must turn their backs on them! Not to give them any absolution. There are now decades of experience. Neither PASOK nor SYRIZA has been able to give an answer from the point of view of the people's interests, either as a government or as an opposition.

Now they have the audacity to say that they will face an "all-powerful" Southwest. We will not tire of repeating this: No bourgeois government, no matter how many deputies it has, is omnipotent when there is a workers' - people's movement, when there is a strong KKE! And in this country, there is a Communist Party of Greece, which in the May elections got 7.23%, and in the next elections, it may become even stronger. A strong KKE means a strong workers' movement, strong people to put obstacles, to delay, and even to have conquests. For us, no negative correlation scares us! No correlation is invincible, as long as the KKE gets stronger. And now our people have a chance to take it even higher. To give strength to its strength. To strengthen the only option that can really scare them: the KKE. Because a vote for the KKE will immediately become a fight and a demand. Because a vote for the KKE will mean consistency, stability for the people. A vote for the KKE means a vote for our lives, not for their profits. A vote for the KKE translates into conflict, into disobedience to everything that makes us indignant.
