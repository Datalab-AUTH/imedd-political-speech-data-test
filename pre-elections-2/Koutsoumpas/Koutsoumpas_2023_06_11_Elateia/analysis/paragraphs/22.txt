Only that they exist for the workers, the breadwinner farmers, and professionals and not for the profits of the industrialists, the shipowners, and the big businessmen. When SYRIZA and PASOK give time to the government of the South-West to gain momentum and continue its all-out attack on the people, the KKE will fight within the people to organize its counter-attack because the best defense against the attack is the counter-attack. That is why the workers, the working people must turn their backs on them! Not to give them any absolution. There are now decades of experience. Neither PASOK nor SYRIZA has been able to give an answer from the point of view of the people's interests, either as a government or as an opposition.
