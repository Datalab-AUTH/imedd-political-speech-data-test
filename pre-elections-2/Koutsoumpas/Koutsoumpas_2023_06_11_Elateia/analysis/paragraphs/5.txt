In the upcoming elections, the crucial factor for the people is who will oppose the anti-people's government from the perspective of the working people's interests. The KKE is the only 100% militant, working people's opposition. There is no need to list what the KKE did during the four years of the ND government, when SYRIZA and PASOK voted 50% each for its anti-people's bills and 70% each for its anti-people's bills. It is unnecessary to say who revealed the unpopular content of the laws of the South-West to the workers and fought for them not to be passed or implemented when SYRIZA and PASOK were backing the South-West and disorienting the people. It is also unnecessary to say who stepped forward in the struggles so that the workers, the breadwinner farmers, and professionals would not have to pay the bills in all the difficult periods, but would also gain respite and be able to survive. Sometimes with the pandemic, sometimes with the crisis that came afterwards, sometimes with the precision and energy poverty, sometimes with the war that continues with the participation of our country, SYRIZA and PASOK were limited to cockfighting in the Parliament, and the KKE fought the battle everywhere in the towns and villages for our people to stand upright.
