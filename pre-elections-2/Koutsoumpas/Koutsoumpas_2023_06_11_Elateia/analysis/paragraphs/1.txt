Our message is being conveyed here today in Elatia. In the May elections, we took a step forward with the significant strengthening of the KKE here in my homeland of Fthiotida, with my election as a member of parliament. We set ourselves the goal of increasing the percentage of the KKE and electing a communist MP in Fthiotida, and we succeeded. Now let's aim for the next one, let's make the leap. Let's strengthen the KKE even more, especially in the towns and villages where working people, breadwinners who fight the daily battle for survival, reside. So let's go strong in the remaining days, so that even more people will arrive with the KKE ballot paper at the ballot box on June 25th, to secure the parliamentary seat in Fthiotida, which you all know will be a strength for the people of the region.
