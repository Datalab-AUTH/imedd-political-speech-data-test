Here in an area where the railway line passes, the services that stop and serve the residents are few and far between. The tickets are very expensive, and of course, everyone thinks that the "new Tempe" is lurking. So, in order not to mourn new victims as in the tragedy of Tempe, here in this earthquake-prone region, it is literally a matter of life and death to take anti-seismic protection measures. The stability of public buildings has not been checked, etc.
