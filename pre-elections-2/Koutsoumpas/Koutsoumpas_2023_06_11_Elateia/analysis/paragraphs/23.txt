Now they have the audacity to say that they will face an "all-powerful" Southwest. We will not tire of repeating this: No bourgeois government, no matter how many deputies it has, is omnipotent when there is a workers' - people's movement, when there is a strong KKE! And in this country, there is a Communist Party of Greece, which in the May elections got 7.23%, and in the next elections, it may become even stronger. A strong KKE means a strong workers' movement, strong people to put obstacles, to delay, and even to have conquests. For us, no negative correlation scares us! No correlation is invincible, as long as the KKE gets stronger. And now our people have a chance to take it even higher. To give strength to its strength. To strengthen the only option that can really scare them: the KKE. Because a vote for the KKE will immediately become a fight and a demand. Because a vote for the KKE will mean consistency, stability for the people. A vote for the KKE means a vote for our lives, not for their profits. A vote for the KKE translates into conflict, into disobedience to everything that makes us indignant.
