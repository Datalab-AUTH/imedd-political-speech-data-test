At the same time, the people of Magnesia and Thessaly can see that these plans are not a "guarantee" and a "shield" against Turkish aggression, as the Southwest and other parties mock. Just as the NATO British bases in Cyprus were no guarantee against the Turkish invasion and occupation, the Thessalian people can reject the arguments about supposedly "strengthening the local economy" due to the presence of foreign military forces. We are talking first of all about money that is stained with the blood of thousands of people who have been killed over the years in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and in so many other wars. We are also talking about a "development" that is synonymous with rot, corruption, and decadence, leading regions to turn into 1960s "Trumps". So now is your chance to send a message with your vote. Turn your back on ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK who have turned Greece into a base for imperialist war. Decisively support the KKE, which with consistency of words and deeds has stepped forward and fought with all its forces against the country's participation in the imperialists' carnage.
