Let's make the biggest effort in the remaining two weeks. Ignore fatigue and confront the sluggish climate that others are fostering, especially with their consent. No vote in the JCP should be wasted on abstention or scattered to the right and left. The step we took on May 21 can now become a leap. With a stronger KKE and a strong people's movement, no government can feel omnipotent. Those who dared, do it again. You have seen that you are not alone. And those who thought about it and hesitated, you have another chance to make the right choice. Choose strength, struggle, and hope for the people. KKE is strong, hope is here!
