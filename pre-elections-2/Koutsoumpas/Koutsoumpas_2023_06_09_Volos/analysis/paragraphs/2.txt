There is no doubt that the next ND government will escalate the policy against the people to serve the interests of big business groups with the consent of SYRIZA and PASOK. The question is how we, the workers, the people, the young people, and the young women, will deal with them. Will we accept new unpopular measures, the 350 preconditions that must be passed by 2026 to disburse the instalments of the famous EU Recovery Fund? Are we going to pay again for their loans and the hot money that the conglomerates will get for their business? Will we accept to pay the bill again for a new economic capitalist crisis? Are we going to put up with new taxes and cuts in the name of 'fiscal stability' imposed by the EU? Yes, taxing the people to tax big business is their common agenda. It is provocative that we are witnessing alleged bickering these days between the parties that have governed and have given too many credentials in this area as well. Because all together, South-West-Syrizia-PASOK, for the last 15 years, they have skinned the people with their taxes and their memorandum laws. They all implemented unfair laws, such as the ENFIA, which SYRIZA was supposedly going to abolish. SYRIZA's government raised VAT rates, and the ND government is keeping them high despite inflation. They all voted for and implemented budgets whereby the people consistently pay 95% of the taxes and big business under 5%. They voted for the voluntary taxation of the shipowners, alongside their more than 50 tax exemptions and their tax exemption, which is enshrined in the Constitution, and of course, they refused the KKE's proposal to abolish it. They applied - ND in 2014 and SYRIZA in 2017 - the patent of the "deferred tax" that gives tax exemption to banks, which last year alone had profits of more than 3 billion euros. They reduced the tax on shareholder dividends, SYRIZA from 15% to 10% and ND from 10% to 5%.
