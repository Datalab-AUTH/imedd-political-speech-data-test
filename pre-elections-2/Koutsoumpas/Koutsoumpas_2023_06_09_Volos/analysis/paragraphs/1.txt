Friends, comrades, and from here in Volos, the capital of Magnesia, we want our message to be heard loud and clear: What matters on June 25th is how strong the KKE will be so that the people can be strong! Only the KKE can consistently, stably, and militantly oppose the next government of the Southwest and its unpopular policies from the perspective of the people's interests. Only the KKE has exercised such opposition, both inside and outside Parliament, during the previous government of the Southwest, when SYRIZA voted for 50% of the Southwest's bills and PASOK voted for 70%. In the May 21st elections, a step was taken. With 7.23% and 26 communist deputies, and with the election of KKE deputies in more regions, such as here in Magnesia. This positive step can be followed by many more, with an even stronger KKE!
