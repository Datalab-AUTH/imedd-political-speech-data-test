Without waiting for anything, we are entering the battle for the signing of collective labor agreements with wage increases and compulsory safety measures at work. This is what the workers in the Perama Shipbuilding Zone achieved with their 48-hour strike after the employer's crime that took the life of another worker. What neither the SYRIZA government nor the ND government had granted them, namely that the contract they signed in 2017 should become compulsory, was imposed on them by their own struggle and with the communists, the KKE candidates in the front line.
