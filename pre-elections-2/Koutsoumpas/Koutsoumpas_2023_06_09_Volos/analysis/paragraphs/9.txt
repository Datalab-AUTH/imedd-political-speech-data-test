Now we can unfortunately answer who was deceiving the people and who was telling the truth because the KKE warned from the very first moment about the real aims of this strategy and stepped forward to organize the workers' resistance. The "gifts" that its implementation brought to the people are now known to all, and they are not limited to the unemployment and poverty that is breaking bones all over Magnesia. Energy precision has knocked on the door of all EU Member States. The soaring energy poverty is the other side of the huge profits reaped by the 'green predators'. As for environmental protection, it has become the briefest of jokes. Giant photovoltaic and wind farms are destroying woodland and surrounding entire villages. Expensive imported American LNG, with a multiply negative environmental footprint both during extraction and for its transport and gasification, was dubbed green overnight. It would be laughable if it were not outrageous to be played as environmentally sensitive by the New Democracy and Syriza, the ones who quadrupled the maximum permissible limit of organic carbon in the exhaust gases of cement kilns to license the carcinogenic burning of garbage by AGET here in Volos. The only green that all these people, the EU, capital, and the parties that serve it know is the green of money and profit.
