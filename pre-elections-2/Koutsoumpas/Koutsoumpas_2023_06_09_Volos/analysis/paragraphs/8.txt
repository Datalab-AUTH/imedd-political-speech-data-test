It is a great mockery of logic to say that if the LNG terminal is built in Magnesia, the people of Magnesia will have cheaper gas. Natural gas is a marketable commodity with an international price that is reflected on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Furthermore, the people of Attica, who are located next to the Revithoussa terminal, do not have a cheaper price for natural gas. But is it worth taking a risk because we will all benefit from the European Union's 'green growth'? Remember, as far back as the 1990s, we were told that once the EU strategy was implemented, the 'liberalisation' of the energy market would ensure cheap electricity for the people and plenty of well-paid jobs. Then we were assured that the 'green transition' investments would protect the environment and that there was a need to move quickly on the de-lignification process. In other words, we should bury a cheap source of energy production, which is abundant in our country, instead of using it with much stricter and modern environmental protection measures.
