The supporters' statements that the LNG investment will bring hundreds of jobs are the "bait" to accept a facility from which the only winners are the US monopolies and shipowners, especially the Greeks who own a large percentage of the world's LNG carriers. The installation of the LNG terminal is in the interest of the US, which wants to win the energy war against Russia in the Balkans and Europe by displacing Russian gas. This plan is also supported by the Greek ruling class, which participates in the energy war on the side of NATO to improve its position and at the same time implements the guidelines of the EU's "green transition" in pursuit of maximum profit.
