Only with the KKE can we create cracks in the negative correlation. Everything changes when the masses decide to take action! The KKE has no ties to the system. A vote for the KKE is the only anti-systemic vote because, in the dilemma of "our lives or their profits," we choose our lives by fighting against the small and big "Temples" that people face every day. The KKE highlights the modern needs of the people and youth in work, education, health, leisure, culture, protection of the life of the people, and the environment against misery and the belief that "nothing can be done." It has a front against fascism and its hotbed, the system of exploitation. Unlike other parties, it does not give shameful pardons to the Nazis. It has a power-governance program with the people at the helm of power, the real owner of the wealth produced. In the present barbarism, there is a way out for the interests of the people, in the conflict and overthrow of the rotten, corrupt system. Only the people can save the people on the road to overthrow with a strong JCP!
