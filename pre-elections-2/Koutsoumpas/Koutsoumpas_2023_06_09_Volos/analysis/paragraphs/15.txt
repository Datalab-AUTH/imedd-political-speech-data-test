Friends and comrades, we invite you to reflect: do you stand to lose or gain from the re-election of Communist MP Vassilis Metaxas in Magnesia and the upcoming elections on June 25th? Can the people of Magnesia expect any benefit from the 43% they gave to ND and the 71% they gave to ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK combined? The answer is nothing at all. He does not need to win again because tomorrow he will find himself against it. On the contrary, the significant increase in votes and percentage for the KKE in Magnesia, which brought it a breath away from third place, is a truly important new force. If these gains are maintained and increased, achieving the election of a deputy again, we will have taken an important step. If these forces are suppressed the next day, the working-people's movement will counter-attack, and things - believe us - will be much better for the people of the region. A different day will have dawned. We, the KKE Organizations throughout Greece, our entire Parliamentary Group, promise to work for this. And we are not just promising it. We have been doing it all the past years and we are doing it now, in between the two elections, without expecting anything.
