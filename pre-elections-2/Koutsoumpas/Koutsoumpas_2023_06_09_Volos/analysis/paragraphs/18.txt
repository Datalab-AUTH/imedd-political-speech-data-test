That means 100% militant popular opposition. The people of Magnesia cannot expect such opposition from either SYRIZA or PASOK, who will continue to give consensus to the next government of the Southwest, or from the so-called "small parties" - parties that are, in fact, disposable. How many times have we seen this so far? Parties without any social reference, without any presence in the struggles of our people, without even a single recognizable member in each region, are "inflated" by the over-promotion given to them at a given moment by the system, to record a "useful" presence for the system in Parliament for 1-2 four-year terms. And then they disappear, and their cadres find a home here and there. This is not only a wasted vote but also wasted time for our people and youth.
