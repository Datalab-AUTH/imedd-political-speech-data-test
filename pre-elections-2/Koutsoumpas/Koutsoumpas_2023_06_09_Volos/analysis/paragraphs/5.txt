Friends, companions, and comrades, their common program is not limited to taxes. It has more. An important part of it is the EU's strategy for the so-called "green transition," which, with a lot of "greenwashing" and environmental sensitivity, has baptized methane as "natural gas" and brought it to the top of the energy production mix in our country, even though there are no domestic sources until now. This is where the plans for the installation of the LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal at the port of Volos come in, plans that have rightly stirred up the people of the city.
