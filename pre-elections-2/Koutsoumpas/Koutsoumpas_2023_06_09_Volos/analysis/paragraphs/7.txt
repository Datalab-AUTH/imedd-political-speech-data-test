But what do the people of the region have to gain? Why should they bear the multiple risks of this investment? Risks that are real, not hypothetical. It is no coincidence that LNG facilities are subject to the European directive concerning large-scale industrial accidents, while what is envisaged is for the company itself to control itself. It is no stranger to major similar accidents in the USA and Norway. The risks of transporting LNG by tanker are known, as are the risks of pollution. The European Commission itself recognises that methane leakage from LNG facilities is a much more potent climate pollutant than carbon dioxide. The negative effects on the marine environment and wetlands are also known. So why should the people bear these risks? Why should we risk mourning the loss of new reservoirs? Will the current capitalist state guarantee our safety? We know this state very well. We know that it appears incapable of meeting our needs precisely because it is too capable of serving big capital. The people of Magnesia have learned this from the good and the bad, in the floods in Almyros and Anchialos in 2020, in the inability to clear the forests and ensure firebreaks, and in the rudimentary existence of the Labour Inspectorate.
