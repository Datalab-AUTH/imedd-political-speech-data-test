A few weeks ago, the European Parliamentary Group of the KKE once again expressed its support for the report of the Environmental Initiative of Magnesia and the Panhellenic Network of Ecological Organizations on the dramatic effects of air pollution caused by the incineration of garbage by AGET on the life and health of the people of Volos. We managed to keep the case open. The only ones who can put a stop to plans that count their lives as a 'cost' for the 'benefit of the few' are the people. The people of Volos are the only ones who can, with their mass struggle, block the plans that involve the region in dangerous paths, mortgage its future, and close their ears to the sirens of the political representatives of capital.
