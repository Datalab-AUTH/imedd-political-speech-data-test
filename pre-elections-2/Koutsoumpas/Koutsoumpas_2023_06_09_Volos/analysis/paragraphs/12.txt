Friends, companions, and comrades, the plans for LNG objectively align with the overall transformation of Magnesia and the whole of Thessaly into a NATO base. This is another question that everyone must answer before the ballot box on June 25th: Will we come to terms with the risks that this policy entails? Will we accept the risks that these risks entail? What about the new shipment of heavy weapons to the Zelensky regime? Will we compromise with NATO's plans for co-exploitation in the Aegean, which are a negative development for the Greek people and all the peoples of the region? New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK are competing with each other to see who will best implement the dangerous plans of the USA and NATO. It is no coincidence that these very issues are absent from the debate between them, from the political debate as a whole. Did you see them arguing about Greece's involvement in the imperialist war in Ukraine? What about the alleged defense agreements with the US, which are far from aggressive, which SYRIZA started with the Trump administration and which ND completed, so that today we have bases, ports, airports, and other infrastructure in the service of the US and NATO, which at the same time are the target of retaliation? But we insist on prioritizing these issues, and we - literally and figuratively - count human lives.
