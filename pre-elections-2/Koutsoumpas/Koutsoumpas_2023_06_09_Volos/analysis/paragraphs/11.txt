For this struggle to be more effective, the KKE needs to come out stronger on June 25th. The opposition of the KKE to projects such as the LNG terminal is not temporary, it is not a "yes but", and it is not hiding behind phrases such as "let's do the environmental study and see what it shows" or "let's put the project in another place", as SYRIZA and PASOK executives suggest. It is clear and comprehensive and is part of our opposition to the entire strategy of the so-called 'Green Transition', which aims to upgrade the country as an energy and goods transport hub for the interests of the Greek bourgeoisie and its allies, at the expense of the people.
