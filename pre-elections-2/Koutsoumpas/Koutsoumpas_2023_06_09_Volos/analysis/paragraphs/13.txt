The workers and young people of Magnesia and all of Thessaly who want to live in peace, who are anxious about the powder keg of war piling up and the imperialist confrontation in Ukraine escalating, and who understand the dangers for our country, are also counting their lives. The people have only to lose from the implementation of the policy that is turning Greece into a NATO flag bearer in the region. The deeper involvement of the country in the war, and the risk of the Volos region itself being hit, does not concern some distant future. Already last year, 12 American attack helicopters left Stefanovikio for Poland. The region's role in NATO's dangerous war plans is now significant. It combines the 110 combat wing in Larissa to serve NATO air forces, the parking of helicopters and airborne units in Stefanovikio, the assembly and disassembly of helicopters, and the reinforced port infrastructure in Almyros for military use. The port of Volos itself is included in US plans for the transport of military cargo to Europe. All of this makes the region a major target for military retaliation. And this crime against the people was initiated by all of the last governments.
