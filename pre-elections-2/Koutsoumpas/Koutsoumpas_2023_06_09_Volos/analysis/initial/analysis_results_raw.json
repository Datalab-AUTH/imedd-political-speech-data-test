{"text_en": "Friends, comrades, and from here in Volos, the capital of Magnesia, we want our message to be heard loud and clear: What matters on June 25th is how strong the KKE will be so that the people can be strong! Only the KKE can consistently, stably, and militantly oppose the next government of the Southwest and its unpopular policies from the perspective of the people's interests. Only the KKE has exercised such opposition, both inside and outside Parliament, during the previous government of the Southwest, when SYRIZA voted for 50% of the Southwest's bills and PASOK voted for 70%. In the May 21st elections, a step was taken. With 7.23% and 26 communist deputies, and with the election of KKE deputies in more regions, such as here in Magnesia. This positive step can be followed by many more, with an even stronger KKE!\n\nThere is no doubt that the next ND government will escalate the policy against the people to serve the interests of big business groups with the consent of SYRIZA and PASOK. The question is how we, the workers, the people, the young people, and the young women, will deal with them. Will we accept new unpopular measures, the 350 preconditions that must be passed by 2026 to disburse the instalments of the famous EU Recovery Fund? Are we going to pay again for their loans and the hot money that the conglomerates will get for their business? Will we accept to pay the bill again for a new economic capitalist crisis? Are we going to put up with new taxes and cuts in the name of 'fiscal stability' imposed by the EU? Yes, taxing the people to tax big business is their common agenda. It is provocative that we are witnessing alleged bickering these days between the parties that have governed and have given too many credentials in this area as well. Because all together, South-West-Syrizia-PASOK, for the last 15 years, they have skinned the people with their taxes and their memorandum laws. They all implemented unfair laws, such as the ENFIA, which SYRIZA was supposedly going to abolish. SYRIZA's government raised VAT rates, and the ND government is keeping them high despite inflation. They all voted for and implemented budgets whereby the people consistently pay 95% of the taxes and big business under 5%. They voted for the voluntary taxation of the shipowners, alongside their more than 50 tax exemptions and their tax exemption, which is enshrined in the Constitution, and of course, they refused the KKE's proposal to abolish it. They applied - ND in 2014 and SYRIZA in 2017 - the patent of the \"deferred tax\" that gives tax exemption to banks, which last year alone had profits of more than 3 billion euros. They reduced the tax on shareholder dividends, SYRIZA from 15% to 10% and ND from 10% to 5%.\n\nThey shaped the regime of \"special taxes\" on electricity and \"energy products\", which they jointly perpetuated with their votes in Parliament last July. This year, in the European Parliament, they voted for new 'green' taxes.\n\nAnd, of course, they all rejected the amendments of the KKE: the abolition of unjust indirect taxes, VAT on food and consumer goods, Special Consumption Taxes on fuel, electricity, water supply, and telecommunications, ENFIA on first and second homes. And now they are arguing, ostensibly, about who is and who is not on board with the taxes? Have mercy! Even mockery has its limits. Things are simple: All of them are with taxes on the people, and all of them are against taxes on business groups to support competitiveness, which is their common goal. That's why it's really laughable to see ND trying to present itself as the \"anti-tax\" party. Who? ND, who under their watch, we have had \"record\" indirect taxes for two years in a row. It is also to be laughed at the attempt by SYRIZA and PASOK to present themselves as the advocates of \"fairer\" taxation. SYRIZA, which otherwise boasts about the 37 billion left as a \"cushion\" from the savage taxing of the people and which says it has the know-how to do it again now that the bloody surpluses are coming back. And PASOK, which dumped a sackful of taxes on the people as government and opposition and voted for every possible and unlikely tax break for capital. No \"hidden agenda\" of taxation, then. Continuing to tax the people is a given, based on their joint commitments to the profits of the business groups. And let's drop the mockery of the so-called \"excess profits\" of 7-8 companies that SYRIZA and PASOK will allegedly tax or that ND has allegedly already taxed. They talk about 7 companies to leave out of the discussion the profits of the 150 listed business groups that increased their profits by 303% last year. So the conclusion is one, to relieve the people of taxes, the prerequisite is that big business loses. And the pie whole and the dog full can't be done. But this is not something that the New Democracy government will do voluntarily, nor will SYRIZA and PASOK push it in this direction, since they all guard the profits of capital like the apple of their eye. Only the people, with their struggles, their movement, and an even stronger KKE can and will impose this!\n\nFriends, companions, and comrades, their common program is not limited to taxes. It has more. An important part of it is the EU's strategy for the so-called \"green transition,\" which, with a lot of \"greenwashing\" and environmental sensitivity, has baptized methane as \"natural gas\" and brought it to the top of the energy production mix in our country, even though there are no domestic sources until now. This is where the plans for the installation of the LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal at the port of Volos come in, plans that have rightly stirred up the people of the city.\n\nThe supporters' statements that the LNG investment will bring hundreds of jobs are the \"bait\" to accept a facility from which the only winners are the US monopolies and shipowners, especially the Greeks who own a large percentage of the world's LNG carriers. The installation of the LNG terminal is in the interest of the US, which wants to win the energy war against Russia in the Balkans and Europe by displacing Russian gas. This plan is also supported by the Greek ruling class, which participates in the energy war on the side of NATO to improve its position and at the same time implements the guidelines of the EU's \"green transition\" in pursuit of maximum profit.\n\nBut what do the people of the region have to gain? Why should they bear the multiple risks of this investment? Risks that are real, not hypothetical. It is no coincidence that LNG facilities are subject to the European directive concerning large-scale industrial accidents, while what is envisaged is for the company itself to control itself. It is no stranger to major similar accidents in the USA and Norway. The risks of transporting LNG by tanker are known, as are the risks of pollution. The European Commission itself recognises that methane leakage from LNG facilities is a much more potent climate pollutant than carbon dioxide. The negative effects on the marine environment and wetlands are also known. So why should the people bear these risks? Why should we risk mourning the loss of new reservoirs? Will the current capitalist state guarantee our safety? We know this state very well. We know that it appears incapable of meeting our needs precisely because it is too capable of serving big capital. The people of Magnesia have learned this from the good and the bad, in the floods in Almyros and Anchialos in 2020, in the inability to clear the forests and ensure firebreaks, and in the rudimentary existence of the Labour Inspectorate.\n\nIt is a great mockery of logic to say that if the LNG terminal is built in Magnesia, the people of Magnesia will have cheaper gas. Natural gas is a marketable commodity with an international price that is reflected on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Furthermore, the people of Attica, who are located next to the Revithoussa terminal, do not have a cheaper price for natural gas. But is it worth taking a risk because we will all benefit from the European Union's 'green growth'? Remember, as far back as the 1990s, we were told that once the EU strategy was implemented, the 'liberalisation' of the energy market would ensure cheap electricity for the people and plenty of well-paid jobs. Then we were assured that the 'green transition' investments would protect the environment and that there was a need to move quickly on the de-lignification process. In other words, we should bury a cheap source of energy production, which is abundant in our country, instead of using it with much stricter and modern environmental protection measures.\n\nNow we can unfortunately answer who was deceiving the people and who was telling the truth because the KKE warned from the very first moment about the real aims of this strategy and stepped forward to organize the workers' resistance. The \"gifts\" that its implementation brought to the people are now known to all, and they are not limited to the unemployment and poverty that is breaking bones all over Magnesia. Energy precision has knocked on the door of all EU Member States. The soaring energy poverty is the other side of the huge profits reaped by the 'green predators'. As for environmental protection, it has become the briefest of jokes. Giant photovoltaic and wind farms are destroying woodland and surrounding entire villages. Expensive imported American LNG, with a multiply negative environmental footprint both during extraction and for its transport and gasification, was dubbed green overnight. It would be laughable if it were not outrageous to be played as environmentally sensitive by the New Democracy and Syriza, the ones who quadrupled the maximum permissible limit of organic carbon in the exhaust gases of cement kilns to license the carcinogenic burning of garbage by AGET here in Volos. The only green that all these people, the EU, capital, and the parties that serve it know is the green of money and profit.\n\nA few weeks ago, the European Parliamentary Group of the KKE once again expressed its support for the report of the Environmental Initiative of Magnesia and the Panhellenic Network of Ecological Organizations on the dramatic effects of air pollution caused by the incineration of garbage by AGET on the life and health of the people of Volos. We managed to keep the case open. The only ones who can put a stop to plans that count their lives as a 'cost' for the 'benefit of the few' are the people. The people of Volos are the only ones who can, with their mass struggle, block the plans that involve the region in dangerous paths, mortgage its future, and close their ears to the sirens of the political representatives of capital.\n\nFor this struggle to be more effective, the KKE needs to come out stronger on June 25th. The opposition of the KKE to projects such as the LNG terminal is not temporary, it is not a \"yes but\", and it is not hiding behind phrases such as \"let's do the environmental study and see what it shows\" or \"let's put the project in another place\", as SYRIZA and PASOK executives suggest. It is clear and comprehensive and is part of our opposition to the entire strategy of the so-called 'Green Transition', which aims to upgrade the country as an energy and goods transport hub for the interests of the Greek bourgeoisie and its allies, at the expense of the people.\n\nFriends, companions, and comrades, the plans for LNG objectively align with the overall transformation of Magnesia and the whole of Thessaly into a NATO base. This is another question that everyone must answer before the ballot box on June 25th: Will we come to terms with the risks that this policy entails? Will we accept the risks that these risks entail? What about the new shipment of heavy weapons to the Zelensky regime? Will we compromise with NATO's plans for co-exploitation in the Aegean, which are a negative development for the Greek people and all the peoples of the region? New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK are competing with each other to see who will best implement the dangerous plans of the USA and NATO. It is no coincidence that these very issues are absent from the debate between them, from the political debate as a whole. Did you see them arguing about Greece's involvement in the imperialist war in Ukraine? What about the alleged defense agreements with the US, which are far from aggressive, which SYRIZA started with the Trump administration and which ND completed, so that today we have bases, ports, airports, and other infrastructure in the service of the US and NATO, which at the same time are the target of retaliation? But we insist on prioritizing these issues, and we - literally and figuratively - count human lives.\n\nThe workers and young people of Magnesia and all of Thessaly who want to live in peace, who are anxious about the powder keg of war piling up and the imperialist confrontation in Ukraine escalating, and who understand the dangers for our country, are also counting their lives. The people have only to lose from the implementation of the policy that is turning Greece into a NATO flag bearer in the region. The deeper involvement of the country in the war, and the risk of the Volos region itself being hit, does not concern some distant future. Already last year, 12 American attack helicopters left Stefanovikio for Poland. The region's role in NATO's dangerous war plans is now significant. It combines the 110 combat wing in Larissa to serve NATO air forces, the parking of helicopters and airborne units in Stefanovikio, the assembly and disassembly of helicopters, and the reinforced port infrastructure in Almyros for military use. The port of Volos itself is included in US plans for the transport of military cargo to Europe. All of this makes the region a major target for military retaliation. And this crime against the people was initiated by all of the last governments.\n\nAt the same time, the people of Magnesia and Thessaly can see that these plans are not a \"guarantee\" and a \"shield\" against Turkish aggression, as the Southwest and other parties mock. Just as the NATO British bases in Cyprus were no guarantee against the Turkish invasion and occupation, the Thessalian people can reject the arguments about supposedly \"strengthening the local economy\" due to the presence of foreign military forces. We are talking first of all about money that is stained with the blood of thousands of people who have been killed over the years in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and in so many other wars. We are also talking about a \"development\" that is synonymous with rot, corruption, and decadence, leading regions to turn into 1960s \"Trumps\". So now is your chance to send a message with your vote. Turn your back on ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK who have turned Greece into a base for imperialist war. Decisively support the KKE, which with consistency of words and deeds has stepped forward and fought with all its forces against the country's participation in the imperialists' carnage.\n\nFriends and comrades, we invite you to reflect: do you stand to lose or gain from the re-election of Communist MP Vassilis Metaxas in Magnesia and the upcoming elections on June 25th? Can the people of Magnesia expect any benefit from the 43% they gave to ND and the 71% they gave to ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK combined? The answer is nothing at all. He does not need to win again because tomorrow he will find himself against it. On the contrary, the significant increase in votes and percentage for the KKE in Magnesia, which brought it a breath away from third place, is a truly important new force. If these gains are maintained and increased, achieving the election of a deputy again, we will have taken an important step. If these forces are suppressed the next day, the working-people's movement will counter-attack, and things - believe us - will be much better for the people of the region. A different day will have dawned. We, the KKE Organizations throughout Greece, our entire Parliamentary Group, promise to work for this. And we are not just promising it. We have been doing it all the past years and we are doing it now, in between the two elections, without expecting anything.\n\nEvery day, the parliamentary candidates of KKE stand by working people who are in danger of having their homes auctioned off or families who are about to be evicted. Hardly a day goes by without examples of such developments being prevented due to the decisive intervention of trade unions, institutions, and KKE.\n\nWithout waiting for anything, we are entering the battle for the signing of collective labor agreements with wage increases and compulsory safety measures at work. This is what the workers in the Perama Shipbuilding Zone achieved with their 48-hour strike after the employer's crime that took the life of another worker. What neither the SYRIZA government nor the ND government had granted them, namely that the contract they signed in 2017 should become compulsory, was imposed on them by their own struggle and with the communists, the KKE candidates in the front line.\n\nThat means 100% militant popular opposition. The people of Magnesia cannot expect such opposition from either SYRIZA or PASOK, who will continue to give consensus to the next government of the Southwest, or from the so-called \"small parties\" - parties that are, in fact, disposable. How many times have we seen this so far? Parties without any social reference, without any presence in the struggles of our people, without even a single recognizable member in each region, are \"inflated\" by the over-promotion given to them at a given moment by the system, to record a \"useful\" presence for the system in Parliament for 1-2 four-year terms. And then they disappear, and their cadres find a home here and there. This is not only a wasted vote but also wasted time for our people and youth.\n\nOnly with the KKE can we create cracks in the negative correlation. Everything changes when the masses decide to take action! The KKE has no ties to the system. A vote for the KKE is the only anti-systemic vote because, in the dilemma of \"our lives or their profits,\" we choose our lives by fighting against the small and big \"Temples\" that people face every day. The KKE highlights the modern needs of the people and youth in work, education, health, leisure, culture, protection of the life of the people, and the environment against misery and the belief that \"nothing can be done.\" It has a front against fascism and its hotbed, the system of exploitation. Unlike other parties, it does not give shameful pardons to the Nazis. It has a power-governance program with the people at the helm of power, the real owner of the wealth produced. In the present barbarism, there is a way out for the interests of the people, in the conflict and overthrow of the rotten, corrupt system. Only the people can save the people on the road to overthrow with a strong JCP!\n\nLet's make the biggest effort in the remaining two weeks. Ignore fatigue and confront the sluggish climate that others are fostering, especially with their consent. No vote in the JCP should be wasted on abstention or scattered to the right and left. The step we took on May 21 can now become a leap. With a stronger KKE and a strong people's movement, no government can feel omnipotent. Those who dared, do it again. You have seen that you are not alone. And those who thought about it and hesitated, you have another chance to make the right choice. Choose strength, struggle, and hope for the people. KKE is strong, hope is here!", "text_el": "\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2

Only the KKE has exercised such opposition, both inside and outside Parliament, during the previous government of the Southwest, when SYRIZA voted for 50% of the Southwest's bills and PASOK voted for 70%. In the May 21st elections, a step was taken. With 7.23% and 26 communist deputies, and with the election of KKE deputies in more regions, such as here in Magnesia.

The question is how we, the workers, the people, the young people, and the young women, will deal with them. Will we accept new unpopular measures, the 350 preconditions that must be passed by 2026 to disburse the instalments of the famous EU Recovery Fund? Are we going to pay again for their loans and the hot money that the conglomerates will get for their business? Will we accept to pay the bill again for a new economic capitalist crisis? Are we going to put up with new taxes and cuts in the name of 'fiscal stability' imposed by the EU? Yes, taxing the people to tax big business is their common agenda. It is provocative that we are witnessing alleged bickering these days between the parties that have governed and have given too many credentials in this area as well. Because all together, South-West-Syrizia-PASOK, for the last 15 years, they have skinned the people with their taxes and their memorandum laws. They all implemented unfair laws, such as the ENFIA, which SYRIZA was supposedly going to abolish. SYRIZA's government raised VAT rates, and the ND government is keeping them high despite inflation. They all voted for and implemented budgets whereby the people consistently pay 95% of the taxes and big business under 5%. They voted for the voluntary taxation of the shipowners, alongside their more than 50 tax exemptions and their tax exemption, which is enshrined in the Constitution, and of course, they refused the KKE's proposal to abolish it. They applied - ND in 2014 and SYRIZA in 2017 - the patent of the \"deferred tax\" that gives tax exemption to banks, which last year alone had profits of more than 3 billion euros. They reduced the tax on shareholder dividends, SYRIZA from 15% to 10% and ND from 10% to 5%.", "word_count_en": 335, "text_el": "\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9

And now they are arguing, ostensibly, about who is and who is not on board with the taxes? Have mercy! Even mockery has its limits. Things are simple: All of them are with taxes on the people, and all of them are against taxes on business groups to support competitiveness, which is their common goal. That's why it's really laughable to see ND trying to present itself as the \"anti-tax\" party. Who? ND, who under their watch, we have had \"record\" indirect taxes for two years in a row. It is also to be laughed at the attempt by SYRIZA and PASOK to present themselves as the advocates of \"fairer\" taxation. SYRIZA, which otherwise boasts about the 37 billion left as a \"cushion\" from the savage taxing of the people and which says it has the know-how to do it again now that the bloody surpluses are coming back. And PASOK, which dumped a sackful of taxes on the people as government and opposition and voted for every possible and unlikely tax break for capital. No \"hidden agenda\" of taxation, then. Continuing to tax the people is a given, based on their joint commitments to the profits of the business groups. And let's drop the mockery of the so-called \"excess profits\" of 7-8 companies that SYRIZA and PASOK will allegedly tax or that ND has allegedly already taxed. They talk about 7 companies to leave out of the discussion the profits of the 150 listed business groups that increased their profits by 303% last year. So the conclusion is one, to relieve the people of taxes, the prerequisite is that big business loses. And the pie whole and the dog full can't be done. But this is not something that the New Democracy government will do voluntarily, nor will SYRIZA and PASOK push it in this direction, since they all guard the profits of capital like the apple of their eye.

The negative effects on the marine environment and wetlands are also known. So why should the people bear these risks? Why should we risk mourning the loss of new reservoirs? Will the current capitalist state guarantee our safety? We know this state very well. We know that it appears incapable of meeting our needs precisely because it is too capable of serving big capital.

Natural gas is a marketable commodity with an international price that is reflected on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Furthermore, the people of Attica, who are located next to the Revithoussa terminal, do not have a cheaper price for natural gas. But is it worth taking a risk because we will all benefit from the European Union's 'green growth'? Remember, as far back as the 1990s, we were told that once the EU strategy was implemented, the 'liberalisation' of the energy market would ensure cheap electricity for the people and plenty of well-paid jobs. Then we were assured that the 'green transition' investments would protect the environment and that there was a need to move quickly on the de-lignification process. In other words, we should bury a cheap source of energy production, which is abundant in our country, instead of using it with much stricter and modern environmental protection measures.", "word_count_en": 175, "text_el": "\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03ca\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03b7 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc LNG \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u039c\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u03bb\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03c6\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b1\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf. \u03a4\u03bf \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b1\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ca\u03cc\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ae \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03a7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0386\u03bc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc. \u0386\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c6\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b1\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c4\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a1\u03b5\u03b2\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2. \u039c\u03ae\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u2019 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u00ab\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03be\u03b7\u00bb \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0388\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2;

What about the new shipment of heavy weapons to the Zelensky regime? Will we compromise with NATO's plans for co-exploitation in the Aegean, which are a negative development for the Greek people and all the peoples of the region? New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK are competing with each other to see who will best implement the dangerous plans of the USA and NATO.

Did you see them arguing about Greece's involvement in the imperialist war in Ukraine? What about the alleged defense agreements with the US, which are far from aggressive, which SYRIZA started with the Trump administration and which ND completed, so that today we have bases, ports, airports, and other infrastructure in the service of the US and NATO, which at the same time are the target of retaliation?

The people have only to lose from the implementation of the policy that is turning Greece into a NATO flag bearer in the region. The deeper involvement of the country in the war, and the risk of the Volos region itself being hit, does not concern some distant future. Already last year, 12 American attack helicopters left Stefanovikio for Poland. The region's role in NATO's dangerous war plans is now significant. It combines the 110 combat wing in Larissa to serve NATO air forces, the parking of helicopters and airborne units in Stefanovikio, the assembly and disassembly of helicopters, and the reinforced port infrastructure in Almyros for military use. The port of Volos itself is included in US plans for the transport of military cargo to Europe. All of this makes the region a major target for military retaliation.

these plans are not a \"guarantee\" and a \"shield\" against Turkish aggression, as the Southwest and other parties mock. Just as the NATO British bases in Cyprus were no guarantee against the Turkish invasion and occupation, the Thessalian people can reject the arguments about supposedly \"strengthening the local economy\" due to the presence of foreign military forces. We are talking first of all about money that is stained with the blood of thousands of people who have been killed over the years in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and in so many other wars. We are also talking about a \"development\" that is synonymous with rot, corruption, and decadence, leading regions to turn into 1960s \"Trumps\". So now is your chance to send a message with your vote. Turn your back on ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK who have turned Greece into a base for imperialist war.

Can the people of Magnesia expect any benefit from the 43% they gave to ND and the 71% they gave to ND, SYRIZA, and PASOK combined? The answer is nothing at all. He does not need to win again because tomorrow he will find himself against it. On the contrary, the significant increase in votes and percentage for the KKE in Magnesia, which brought it a breath away from third place, is a truly important new force. If these gains are maintained and increased, achieving the election of a deputy again, we will have taken an important step.
