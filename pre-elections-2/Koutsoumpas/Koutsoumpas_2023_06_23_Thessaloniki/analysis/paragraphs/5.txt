But we do not accept that the Greek people are generally and vaguely conservative, and that this is de facto over and done with. We believe that a new current of progressivism and radicalism can be born, which will embrace large masses of the people and youth of our country. Without new illusions, for new saviors. And the KKE will lead this current. How will this be done? Through the rise of the class struggle, through the rise of the workers', people's, and youth struggles. There, the way is opened to new consciousness that may now see no other alternative. There, the real correlations change. In the workplaces, in the unions, in the class struggle. There, the power that each of us has is fully realized, and then we all organize hand in hand. There, the umbilical cord is cut with the parties of bourgeois power, with the buffets, with the mechanisms of integration. That's where the hope is. In the struggle! With a stronger KKE.
