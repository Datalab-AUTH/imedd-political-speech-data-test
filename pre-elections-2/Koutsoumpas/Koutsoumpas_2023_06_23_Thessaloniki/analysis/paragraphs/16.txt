It is not a one-way street to be angry, indignant, and not know what to do if you don't know who is to blame, and ultimately feel helpless. We say to everyone from the bottom of our hearts: Strengthen the KKE now, and you will know that from the next day, you will find this support next to you. It will be the only one that, from day one, will be the 100% militant, popular opposition, the only one that the people really need.
