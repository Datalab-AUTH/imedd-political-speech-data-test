When SYRIZA once again proved, in the face of the tragic shipwreck, that it is so committed to EU policy that it has not found a word for its responsibilities, how can we expect anything different? Did they sign the agreement with Turkey? Did they expand the modern hellhole of Moria? Did they bring FRONTEX into our home to reinforce their policy of repression and NATO to patrol the Aegean? This is why we say that we need to confront EU policy and struggle for liberation from its shackles, as well as from the NATO war machine.
