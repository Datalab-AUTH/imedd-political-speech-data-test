To all of you, the KKE reaches out again. On Sunday, take the big step finally! Let's meet at the ballot box together. To meet again in the struggles of the next day. Because every leftist can vote now, knowing that they won't regret it, KKE. But even more so in these last hours, we are addressing the majority of the Greek people, the young people. We know that we are all concerned. We all know what lies ahead of us. We have a difficult reality to face with unpopular pre-conditions, punctuality flaring up, a new recession possibly just around the corner, and imperialist war raging. But now is the time of responsibility, and we must reflect with a clear mind on what we have lived through these four years, taking stock before we get to the ballot box. We have lived through unprecedented events, tragedies coming one after another. From the hundreds of deaths of the pandemic to the horrors of war, from the huge burnt areas all over Greece to the floods and ecological disasters, and from the 57 dead of Tempe to the hundreds of drowned and missing in Pylos. We have seen a huge gap widening between how we live, how we struggle to manage in our daily lives, and how a handful of people get rich.
