Shall we mention just one example from the past two years? While the cost of food was increasing by 25 percent, the profits of a few companies on the stock market were rising by 300 and a half percent. Let each of us reflect on the moments in the past few years when we felt angry, when we experienced injustice, when we realized that this system was not suitable and saw dead ends ahead of us. Who has not been outraged by the images of repression? Which neighborhood did not rise up when the crows went to snatch poor people's houses? Who managed to sleep in the days after Tempe?
