But how important will it be for the people of Thessaloniki to finally dispose of the far-right formation of Velopoulos, with its constant racist rhetoric, as well as the other reactionary groups that function like a cult, such as Niki, and the pro-Nazi supporters of convicted murderers? These parties are not just quaint, but dangerous, full of unscientific theories and creepy positions on "forced labor for those in debt," resulting in critical support for unpopular measures and full support for employers. Let's send all of these far-right and pro-Nazi parties to the Thermaikos and let them drown there!
