Comrades, friends, in a few hours, the people have a great opportunity before them. All the signs and messages that we have, the great rally in Athens, the one before that in Patras, yesterday's in Lamia, and today's in Thessaloniki, show that now our people can raise the KKE even higher. They can go to the ballot box with a much stronger KKE, with a higher percentage and more deputies everywhere. And here in Thessaloniki, the people of the city can take the step and elect the 2nd deputy in the 1st constituency of the city again after 15 years, to send the extreme right-wing formation of Velopoulos to the dust and make the KKE the 3rd party in Thessaloniki. It will be a great victory for the people and a legacy for the struggles ahead of us.
