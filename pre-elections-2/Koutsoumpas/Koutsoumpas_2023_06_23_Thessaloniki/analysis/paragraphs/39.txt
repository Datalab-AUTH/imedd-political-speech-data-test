Because it is the only vote that fills you with pride, it is the only vote you don't cast half-heartedly, it is the only vote you don't cast as the "lesser evil." Now, JCP will fill the workers of all Europe with smiles, all those whose hearts beat left, red-hot, all those who face the red, universal hammer and whose souls are on fire. Now, from here, from our small country but with a very large population, let us give them more reasons for optimism. Now, JCE for all those who, because they want to be called human beings, have not ceased for a moment to fight for justice, for man, for peace, for all that should be self-evident in our century. Now, JCE for the youth of this land who have taken to the streets, who have cried out, who have fought, and who have before them the avenues of a more beautiful future. So let's all go together! Let's raise our fist and our boot a little higher on Sunday. And from Monday back to the struggles, with new strength, with optimism, with a smile, with our confidence that our people will finally win. Now higher for the KKE! Because KKE strong, hope is here!
