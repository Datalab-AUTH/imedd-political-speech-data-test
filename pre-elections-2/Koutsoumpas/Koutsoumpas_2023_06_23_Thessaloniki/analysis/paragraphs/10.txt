The students who have just finished the ordeal of the national exams and those who have it ahead of them, is it normal for them to be educated in a school that is exclusively an examination centre? Are students who have even experienced the dropping of chemicals in an auditorium here in Thessaloniki happy with a university with substandard infrastructure and dormitories, with expensive postgraduate degrees?
