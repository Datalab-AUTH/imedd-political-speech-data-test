Friends, companions, and comrades, we believe that the lost lives of dozens of our fellow human beings in the waters of the Aegean and the Mediterranean once again reveal the true face of the European Union, an alliance of bandits, in the most brutal way. It is time for our people to draw broader conclusions because the EU's signature is on every small and large shipwreck we have experienced and are experiencing. The EU's signature has led the damned of this land to the bottom of the Aegean Sea with policies of repression and confinement, Dublin, the agreement with Turkey, and essentially the 'legalization' of push-backs, Moria, and the camps. The EU's signature built the Tempi railways, where 57 people died.
