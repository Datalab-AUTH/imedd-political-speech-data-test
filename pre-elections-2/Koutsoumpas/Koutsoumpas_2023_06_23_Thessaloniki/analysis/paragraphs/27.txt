The cost-benefit policy also has its own impact on hospitals, as we have recently seen with the tragedies involving the ambulance service. This is also being experienced in the region of Central Macedonia, with a lack of children's ICU beds - only 10 for the whole of Northern Greece - and staff shortages reaching up to 30% of the required positions, particularly in the regional hospitals of Central Macedonia. Anaesthesiologists are only covering 25% of the required positions in hospitals like Hippokratio and Papanikolaou, and there is a shortage of medicines, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as pensioners. This is the policy of governments and the EU in healthcare!
