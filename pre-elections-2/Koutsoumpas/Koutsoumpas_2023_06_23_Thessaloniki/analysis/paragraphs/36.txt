So Thessaloniki should have the KKE as the third party! As it happened in Toumba, Ano Poli, Agios Pavlos, the center of Kalamaria, Hortiatis, now it should happen everywhere! And in Evosmos, all of Kalamaria, Polihni, Stavroupoli, everywhere! In every district where the heart of the people and the working class beats, the ballot boxes should be filled with red ballots! Comrades and friends, from our last rally here in Thessaloniki, we are sending a message to all of Greece for these last hours. Hope is here! Now KKE is stronger because: The people will need it directly with them in the struggles, with the communists in the front line! It will give all its forces to unite the pockets of resistance in a rushing nationwide river of demands. It will be there to expose what they are hiding from the people. To expose the unpopular policy and the essential alliance between the South-West-Syriza-PASOK. It will be the only thing that spoils their unpopular consensus and agreement on all critical issues in parliament. It will be the only one that will have no commitment from big interests, the only one they will never put their hands on. That will clash with the big bosses and big employers.
