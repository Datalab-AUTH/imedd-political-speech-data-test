Dear friends, we also want to address the hundreds of thousands who have not yet made up their minds in these last hours and may even end up at the ballot box unsure of what they will vote for. We say to them: you have a great opportunity. Your vote can now count many times over. It is the one that can play the decisive role in determining whether the KKE will win one, two, three, up to 5 or 6 more MPs, depending on its percentage. Because it will really be the vote that determines whether the KKE will manage to retain all its deputies. Because only the increase of the KKE, even the smallest one, has so much importance for the people. We indeed agree with Mr. Tsipras on this. It is really completely irrelevant whether Syriza falls to 19 or 18 or 17%, whether PASOK loses 1 or 2 points, whether ND will be self-reliant with 1 or 2 points less. But it is very important that KKE is higher. To have more MPs. So that there are more of those who will be in the auctions of people's houses, in workplaces, where the people need them.
