Friends, the previous election period has solemnly proven everything we knew. Only a few days after the previous elections, the joint program of New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK was revealed in the most official way through the Commission's report. The program confirmed that, along with the "stable" government, there will be a coalition opposition. It also proved in the clearest possible way that a number of literally 'disposable' parties have been created, which exist today and tomorrow you do not know where they will be. There have been mass withdrawals from Constantopoulou's Pleiisi, another one from Varoufakis' Mera, and another one to two from Velopoulos' Hellenic Solution. These are parties that you don't even know what candidates they have or what their program is many times!
