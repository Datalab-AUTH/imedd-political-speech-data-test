And from here, in Thessaloniki, we want to say once again: The KKE will not allow them to be forgotten! Our people will not forget this crime. First and foremost, we want to assure the families that we will not let political and criminal responsibilities be forgotten. We have proposed the repeal of the law on ministerial responsibility, which all other parties have rejected. We will not allow new Tempus. We owe it to these guys. We took an oath and we will fulfill it.
