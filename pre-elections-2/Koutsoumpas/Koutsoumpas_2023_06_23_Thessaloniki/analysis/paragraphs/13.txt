So let everyone put all of this on a scale and think about their needs, dreams, and desires. In other words, everything that they believe they deserve in the 21st century. Let them ask themselves: Can we continue like this? We say no! Our time and the possibilities that exist are for much more! The Communist Party says we can do better! We fight boldly because we believe that constantly experiencing new tragedies is not the only option. It is not acceptable for people's lives to be measured in terms of profit. It cannot be considered realistic to see a large part of young people trapped in flexible working relationships, in the galleys of the summer season, or struggling to earn a living wage.
