The people need MPs who know they will be there, not parties that appear and disappear overnight. MPs who know where their cap is coming from: opportunists, careerists who take refuge in formations that will not exist tomorrow. When you look more closely at such parties and look a little harder, you see that in the end their leaders have both a dirty past and a certain unpopular future. They are born servants of this barbaric system. Our people do not need such people in parliament.
