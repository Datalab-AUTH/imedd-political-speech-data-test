If the owners of the collection companies were in the parliamentary group of ND... If those who voted for the handover of the red loans to the funds were present... If the lawyers of the funds were on the voting lists of PASOK... On the KKE ballot papers are those who are dragged to court by the funds because they defend the houses of the people together with the people... Things are sometimes that simple... That's who you are and that's who we are and everyone picks and chooses!
