We are also the ones who do not try to hide behind the general "conservatism" label. Isn't it a little late for tears from those who make these statements, like Syriza? Shouldn't they have thought about it before labeling fascist supporters of murderous Chrysayites as misguided? Shouldn't they have thought about it before crushing the hopes of many with a third and worse memorandum? I mean, what did they expect, with Marantzidis as their advisor and the right-wing Antonaro as their henchman, even after a four-year alliance with the far-right Kamenos in government? To make Syriza voters more progressive?
