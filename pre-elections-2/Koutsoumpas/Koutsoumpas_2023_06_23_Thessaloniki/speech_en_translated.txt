Comrades, friends, in a few hours, the people have a great opportunity before them. All the signs and messages that we have, the great rally in Athens, the one before that in Patras, yesterday's in Lamia, and today's in Thessaloniki, show that now our people can raise the KKE even higher. They can go to the ballot box with a much stronger KKE, with a higher percentage and more deputies everywhere. And here in Thessaloniki, the people of the city can take the step and elect the 2nd deputy in the 1st constituency of the city again after 15 years, to send the extreme right-wing formation of Velopoulos to the dust and make the KKE the 3rd party in Thessaloniki. It will be a great victory for the people and a legacy for the struggles ahead of us.

Friends, the previous election period has solemnly proven everything we knew. Only a few days after the previous elections, the joint program of New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK was revealed in the most official way through the Commission's report. The program confirmed that, along with the "stable" government, there will be a coalition opposition. It also proved in the clearest possible way that a number of literally 'disposable' parties have been created, which exist today and tomorrow you do not know where they will be. There have been mass withdrawals from Constantopoulou's Pleiisi, another one from Varoufakis' Mera, and another one to two from Velopoulos' Hellenic Solution. These are parties that you don't even know what candidates they have or what their program is many times!

But above all, from the very next day of the elections, what the people knew was confirmed: that the KKE will be there from the very first moment. And we were there, next to the residents of Kalamia Kozani, together with the workers of Zoni, when they lost their colleague in front of the people's houses so that none of them would be lost in an auction, outside the Ministry of Health so that no more human lives would be lost due to shortages in healthcare, and also in the flooded houses of Polihni. Everywhere, the KKE was there, the only 100% militant, popular opposition, not in words, but in practice! The KKE proved in this election period that it is the only hope for the people. At the time, when immediately after the previous elections, SYRIZA was again sowing disappointment, when its members and cadres were lying around cursing the people and saying that "nothing can change," the KKE told the people from the very first moment that the election result creates new difficulties, but there is hope. We can be optimistic because the KKE can become stronger and face them. We have proved once again that we are the only ones who are not afraid in the face of negative correlation! And this is a guarantee for the people for the next difficult day with the unpopular government of the Southwest. Because we know that with the KKE in front, the people have the power to sweep them away. Because we will lead the workers' and people's struggle against the new anti-people's government of the Southwest, against the policy of the EU, for what the people and the workers in our country need and demand. We stand firm because we have confidence in the people. Because we know that nothing is invincible or immovable. Because the only times when the government of the Southwest was really squeezed, when it had a hard time, in the past four years, was when the people came forward with the communists. In the pandemic, in the demonstrations against repression, in the big strikes, in the demonstrations against the warlike involvement, in the magnificent demonstrations over the Tempi. And let's not have the confidence and the "thousand hearts" style in the Southwest that they are taking an unpopular walk. Such was the case with the GOPites, and we saw what happened to them, from the communists and the Panchayat. There is a KKE here!

We are also the ones who do not try to hide behind the general "conservatism" label. Isn't it a little late for tears from those who make these statements, like Syriza? Shouldn't they have thought about it before labeling fascist supporters of murderous Chrysayites as misguided? Shouldn't they have thought about it before crushing the hopes of many with a third and worse memorandum? I mean, what did they expect, with Marantzidis as their advisor and the right-wing Antonaro as their henchman, even after a four-year alliance with the far-right Kamenos in government? To make Syriza voters more progressive?

But we do not accept that the Greek people are generally and vaguely conservative, and that this is de facto over and done with. We believe that a new current of progressivism and radicalism can be born, which will embrace large masses of the people and youth of our country. Without new illusions, for new saviors. And the KKE will lead this current. How will this be done? Through the rise of the class struggle, through the rise of the workers', people's, and youth struggles. There, the way is opened to new consciousness that may now see no other alternative. There, the real correlations change. In the workplaces, in the unions, in the class struggle. There, the power that each of us has is fully realized, and then we all organize hand in hand. There, the umbilical cord is cut with the parties of bourgeois power, with the buffets, with the mechanisms of integration. That's where the hope is. In the struggle! With a stronger KKE.

But how would those who cut ties with the movement years ago know this? How would those who suppressed, integrated, and turned the hope of pure, progressive people into a safety cushion for the most vile, unpopular policies know this? In these remaining hours, we know that the hearts of many left-wing people who once believed in Syriza are boiling. We know that many of them have felt a second wave of disillusionment over these years, seeing Syriza do what they once thought was unthinkable - turning into the best partner of New Democracy in all critical moments, offering the necessary helping hand in the pandemic, abolishing the 8-hour workday, suppressing youth mobilizations, participating in the war in Ukraine, and accepting Azov's Nazis even in the Greek parliament.

To all of you, the KKE reaches out again. On Sunday, take the big step finally! Let's meet at the ballot box together. To meet again in the struggles of the next day. Because every leftist can vote now, knowing that they won't regret it, KKE. But even more so in these last hours, we are addressing the majority of the Greek people, the young people. We know that we are all concerned. We all know what lies ahead of us. We have a difficult reality to face with unpopular pre-conditions, punctuality flaring up, a new recession possibly just around the corner, and imperialist war raging. But now is the time of responsibility, and we must reflect with a clear mind on what we have lived through these four years, taking stock before we get to the ballot box. We have lived through unprecedented events, tragedies coming one after another. From the hundreds of deaths of the pandemic to the horrors of war, from the huge burnt areas all over Greece to the floods and ecological disasters, and from the 57 dead of Tempe to the hundreds of drowned and missing in Pylos. We have seen a huge gap widening between how we live, how we struggle to manage in our daily lives, and how a handful of people get rich.

Shall we mention just one example from the past two years? While the cost of food was increasing by 25 percent, the profits of a few companies on the stock market were rising by 300 and a half percent. Let each of us reflect on the moments in the past few years when we felt angry, when we experienced injustice, when we realized that this system was not suitable and saw dead ends ahead of us. Who has not been outraged by the images of repression? Which neighborhood did not rise up when the crows went to snatch poor people's houses? Who managed to sleep in the days after Tempe?

Who can tolerate being paid 700, 800, or 900 euros when their skills and knowledge are worth much more? Let young people, in particular, think about their own experience.

The students who have just finished the ordeal of the national exams and those who have it ahead of them, is it normal for them to be educated in a school that is exclusively an examination centre? Are students who have even experienced the dropping of chemicals in an auditorium here in Thessaloniki happy with a university with substandard infrastructure and dormitories, with expensive postgraduate degrees?

Are young people's expectations being met with jobs that offer flexible working conditions, regardless of whether the positions are related to their degree, and with salaries that barely cover the high cost of rent?

Can a young couple plan their life with an income that ends in the first 15 days of the month?

So let everyone put all of this on a scale and think about their needs, dreams, and desires. In other words, everything that they believe they deserve in the 21st century. Let them ask themselves: Can we continue like this? We say no! Our time and the possibilities that exist are for much more! The Communist Party says we can do better! We fight boldly because we believe that constantly experiencing new tragedies is not the only option. It is not acceptable for people's lives to be measured in terms of profit. It cannot be considered realistic to see a large part of young people trapped in flexible working relationships, in the galleys of the summer season, or struggling to earn a living wage.

It is not normal in 2023 to not even find an EHIC ambulance.

Workers cannot be killed in the workplace because protecting their lives is a priority.

It is not a one-way street to be angry, indignant, and not know what to do if you don't know who is to blame, and ultimately feel helpless. We say to everyone from the bottom of our hearts: Strengthen the KKE now, and you will know that from the next day, you will find this support next to you. It will be the only one that, from day one, will be the 100% militant, popular opposition, the only one that the people really need.

It will lead the way in the workplace, alongside workers who demand wage increases, decent working conditions, health and safety measures, and collective bargaining.

It will be in every person's house that is in danger of foreclosure and lacks funds.

They will be on the road to prevent the 350 preconditions of the new loan that they loaded us with, with the new Supermemorandum and the Recovery Fund.

They will be at the forefront with health workers and all people to demand that healthcare be a social good, free for all people, with infrastructure and permanent staff.

They will be with the students at the universities to prevent the reactionary restructuring that they are planning with the private universities from going through.

They will stand with pensioners to claim what has been robbed from them for so many years.

It will be, above all, the one that keeps the spark lit for the darkness to become light, with a society without the exploitation of man by man: socialism. The society we will live in! With the proposal of power, the government of the KKE for socialized means of production, with centralized scientific planning, without the criterion of profit being an obstacle to the satisfaction of needs. All of this and much more can be achieved with a stronger people and a strong KKE on their side.

Friends, companions, and comrades, we believe that the lost lives of dozens of our fellow human beings in the waters of the Aegean and the Mediterranean once again reveal the true face of the European Union, an alliance of bandits, in the most brutal way. It is time for our people to draw broader conclusions because the EU's signature is on every small and large shipwreck we have experienced and are experiencing. The EU's signature has led the damned of this land to the bottom of the Aegean Sea with policies of repression and confinement, Dublin, the agreement with Turkey, and essentially the 'legalization' of push-backs, Moria, and the camps. The EU's signature built the Tempi railways, where 57 people died.

And from here, in Thessaloniki, we want to say once again: The KKE will not allow them to be forgotten! Our people will not forget this crime. First and foremost, we want to assure the families that we will not let political and criminal responsibilities be forgotten. We have proposed the repeal of the law on ministerial responsibility, which all other parties have rejected. We will not allow new Tempus. We owe it to these guys. We took an oath and we will fulfill it.

Friends, the EU signature is not just about that. It is the EU with a Commission report that calls for accelerated auctions to reduce "private debt". It is the one calling for 350 unpopular laws for the recovery fund.

The cost-benefit policy also has its own impact on hospitals, as we have recently seen with the tragedies involving the ambulance service. This is also being experienced in the region of Central Macedonia, with a lack of children's ICU beds - only 10 for the whole of Northern Greece - and staff shortages reaching up to 30% of the required positions, particularly in the regional hospitals of Central Macedonia. Anaesthesiologists are only covering 25% of the required positions in hospitals like Hippokratio and Papanikolaou, and there is a shortage of medicines, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as pensioners. This is the policy of governments and the EU in healthcare!

The KKE is the only one confronting the EU as a whole and head-on, while others like "Pλεύsi" have forgotten how to resist. The KKE is the only one telling the people that this reactionary alliance cannot be fixed by the media, like the nonsense sold by Varoufakis. The KKE is the only one that the Greek people can trust to take on the EU policy that ND, closely followed by SYRIZA and PASOK, have co-formulated and are ready to implement.

When SYRIZA once again proved, in the face of the tragic shipwreck, that it is so committed to EU policy that it has not found a word for its responsibilities, how can we expect anything different? Did they sign the agreement with Turkey? Did they expand the modern hellhole of Moria? Did they bring FRONTEX into our home to reinforce their policy of repression and NATO to patrol the Aegean? This is why we say that we need to confront EU policy and struggle for liberation from its shackles, as well as from the NATO war machine.

Dear friends, we also want to address the hundreds of thousands who have not yet made up their minds in these last hours and may even end up at the ballot box unsure of what they will vote for. We say to them: you have a great opportunity. Your vote can now count many times over. It is the one that can play the decisive role in determining whether the KKE will win one, two, three, up to 5 or 6 more MPs, depending on its percentage. Because it will really be the vote that determines whether the KKE will manage to retain all its deputies. Because only the increase of the KKE, even the smallest one, has so much importance for the people. We indeed agree with Mr. Tsipras on this. It is really completely irrelevant whether Syriza falls to 19 or 18 or 17%, whether PASOK loses 1 or 2 points, whether ND will be self-reliant with 1 or 2 points less. But it is very important that KKE is higher. To have more MPs. So that there are more of those who will be in the auctions of people's houses, in workplaces, where the people need them.

If the owners of the collection companies were in the parliamentary group of ND... If those who voted for the handover of the red loans to the funds were present... If the lawyers of the funds were on the voting lists of PASOK... On the KKE ballot papers are those who are dragged to court by the funds because they defend the houses of the people together with the people... Things are sometimes that simple... That's who you are and that's who we are and everyone picks and chooses!

It is important for the KKE to have a higher presence in parliament because only with communist MPs can your vote be guaranteed to not be added to those supporting policies you wish to condemn. It is certain that the KKE will not vote for the revision of Article 16 of the Constitution and will also organize student protests, while all other parties from SYRIZA and PASOK to PLUSI and MERA are ready to discuss it.

The people need MPs who know they will be there, not parties that appear and disappear overnight. MPs who know where their cap is coming from: opportunists, careerists who take refuge in formations that will not exist tomorrow. When you look more closely at such parties and look a little harder, you see that in the end their leaders have both a dirty past and a certain unpopular future. They are born servants of this barbaric system. Our people do not need such people in parliament.

But it is very important for Thessaloniki, a city of one million people, to have three MPs from the KKE. Think of how many times the people of the city will need the presence of KKE MPs in the coming years. How many more interventions could be made if only two MPs managed to do over 600 in the past four years.

But how important will it be for the people of Thessaloniki to finally dispose of the far-right formation of Velopoulos, with its constant racist rhetoric, as well as the other reactionary groups that function like a cult, such as Niki, and the pro-Nazi supporters of convicted murderers? These parties are not just quaint, but dangerous, full of unscientific theories and creepy positions on "forced labor for those in debt," resulting in critical support for unpopular measures and full support for employers. Let's send all of these far-right and pro-Nazi parties to the Thermaikos and let them drown there!

So Thessaloniki should have the KKE as the third party! As it happened in Toumba, Ano Poli, Agios Pavlos, the center of Kalamaria, Hortiatis, now it should happen everywhere! And in Evosmos, all of Kalamaria, Polihni, Stavroupoli, everywhere! In every district where the heart of the people and the working class beats, the ballot boxes should be filled with red ballots! Comrades and friends, from our last rally here in Thessaloniki, we are sending a message to all of Greece for these last hours. Hope is here! Now KKE is stronger because: The people will need it directly with them in the struggles, with the communists in the front line! It will give all its forces to unite the pockets of resistance in a rushing nationwide river of demands. It will be there to expose what they are hiding from the people. To expose the unpopular policy and the essential alliance between the South-West-Syriza-PASOK. It will be the only thing that spoils their unpopular consensus and agreement on all critical issues in parliament. It will be the only one that will have no commitment from big interests, the only one they will never put their hands on. That will clash with the big bosses and big employers.

It will be the only one to take on EU policy, as well as the NATO war machine and the very dangerous plans in our region, especially in the Aegean and in Greek-Turkish relations.

It is this vote that their system fears, and that is why the KKE is being charged with exorbitant fines, as in Attica. That is why they do not ensure even the minimum visibility of the KKE in their channels and media. In spite of all this, now KKE!

Because it is the only vote that fills you with pride, it is the only vote you don't cast half-heartedly, it is the only vote you don't cast as the "lesser evil." Now, JCP will fill the workers of all Europe with smiles, all those whose hearts beat left, red-hot, all those who face the red, universal hammer and whose souls are on fire. Now, from here, from our small country but with a very large population, let us give them more reasons for optimism. Now, JCE for all those who, because they want to be called human beings, have not ceased for a moment to fight for justice, for man, for peace, for all that should be self-evident in our century. Now, JCE for the youth of this land who have taken to the streets, who have cried out, who have fought, and who have before them the avenues of a more beautiful future. So let's all go together! Let's raise our fist and our boot a little higher on Sunday. And from Monday back to the struggles, with new strength, with optimism, with a smile, with our confidence that our people will finally win. Now higher for the KKE! Because KKE strong, hope is here!
