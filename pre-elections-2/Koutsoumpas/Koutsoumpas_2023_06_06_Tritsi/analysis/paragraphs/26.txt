In the energy sector, only socialist energy planning can utilize all of the country's energy resources to eliminate energy poverty and unemployment, reduce dependence on imports, and protect the safety of workers and the health of residents while ensuring minimal interference with the environment. Only scientific research under socialism can be used without hindrance to anticipate and meet the future needs of the people in a timely manner, rather than being limited to the search for optimal solutions for the profitability of capitalism. Above all, it will ensure that land and its use, fuel, electricity, water, health, and labor power are no longer commodities. Worker power and social ownership of land can transform the natural environment from a source of exploitation and speculation to an integral element of development based on social well-being. Through the abolition of capitalist ownership and profit, through the uprooting of competitions for land use, integrated planning of political protection, and zoning of activities aimed at the well-being of the people, can be achieved. Scientific central planning of production, aimed at satisfying the needs of society and minimizing the negative impact on the environment of all productive and social activities, is also an important element in the KKE's proposal.
