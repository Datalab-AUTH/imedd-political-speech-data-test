Friends, Today, in the face of the upcoming election battle, the issue of the environment must and can be an important voting criterion. The KKE calls on all workers to "black out" all the parties of the notorious green transition, EU policies, and all those who ask them to sacrifice their lives to ensure the profitability of big capital. We call on the workers to reflect on their experience and draw conclusions. ND-PASOK-SYRIZA are the standard-bearers of this 'green attack' on the income and needs of the people. No party that promotes the plans for the "green transition", the European Union, and NATO, no party that submits to the goals of the ruling class, can create a better future for the people.
