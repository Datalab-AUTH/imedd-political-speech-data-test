Unfortunately, capitalism is not "green"; it is pitch black. It cannot reduce its negative impact on the environment. The reality is that capitalism perceives the environment solely as a field of profitability by its very nature. It uses the environment as raw material, as economic soil. That is why it can only destroy it. Industrial accidents, pollution, the relaxation of conditions for mining and tourist activities, and the concreting of every coastline to ensure profitability are proof of this.
