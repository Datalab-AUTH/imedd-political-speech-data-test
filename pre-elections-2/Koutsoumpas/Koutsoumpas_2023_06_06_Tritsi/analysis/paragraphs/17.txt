Climate change phenomena, on which scientists have yet to agree and there is debate, are being used as a political tool to convince workers to dig deep into their pockets. They are being asked to pay for green energy, limit their commuting, accept new costs for energy upgrading of buildings, and limit heating in winter and air conditioning in summer. All of this is so that the huge profits of the monopoly groups investing in green energy, modern buildings, and electric cars can accrue. This is the real nature of the EU and urban governments' policy of green transition. The new sacrifices of the workers, energy poverty, destruction of the mountains to advance green upcoming investments, and restriction of mobility for the broad working people are just the other side of the huge profits of the energy conglomerates and modern electric cars.
