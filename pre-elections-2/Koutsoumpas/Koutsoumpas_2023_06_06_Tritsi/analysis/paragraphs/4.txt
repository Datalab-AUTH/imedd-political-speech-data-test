Friends, friends
As every year in the celebration of World Environment Day, the parties in the system are competing with each other to see which one can most effectively promote the EU's "green transition". We hear and read, announcement after announcement, about how important the environment and its management is.If one were to take these analyses at face value, one would come to the conclusion that Greece is the greenest country in the world!It would be easy to believe that, while almost everything can go wrong, in the field of the environment, the EU, the bourgeois state and the parties that have governed over the past years have done real miracles. You would think that Greece is a country with a natural environment that is protected, with inhabitants who enjoy the beauty of Greek nature.
