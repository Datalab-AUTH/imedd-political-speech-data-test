Nuclear power plants are hazardous due to their waste. The mining, separation, and polluting treatment of rare earths are also considered green. The hypocrisy of limiting carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases is evident when considering the double standards. If the European Union and urban governments truly aimed to limit emissions, they would not exclude large hydroelectric projects from renewable energy projects, as they produce cheap renewable energy. They would not prioritize natural gas as a strategic fuel, which produces carbon dioxide and has a negative impact on the environment when leaked. At the very least, they would limit energy waste from ultra-luxury hotels.
