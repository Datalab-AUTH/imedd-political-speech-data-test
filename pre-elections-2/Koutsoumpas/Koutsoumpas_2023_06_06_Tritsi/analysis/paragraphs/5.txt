But reality contradicts these claims, and does so solemnly. There is no need for a long, lengthy analysis. A glance around is enough to convince anyone. Tritsis Park could be a real green lung, an oasis of freshness for hundreds of thousands of residents and workers in the center of Athens. But in reality, it remains without infrastructure, while large parts of it are being targeted by construction and other monopoly groups. The open spaces in the Attica region, in general, the most overloaded residential area of the country, from Strefis Hill to Areos Field, from the center of Athens, which is being 'redeveloped' as a playground for high luxury tourism, to the areas that we are told are being "upgraded by the metro" and yet, especially in these areas, the big groups attack like crows and further degrade, privatize, and change uses. Perhaps the greatest proof in the Attica region of the timeless hypocrisy of all urban powers when it comes to the environment is the example of Elliniko. At the same time that everyone is ostensibly crying about the so-called "climate crisis" and the burden on the lives of city dwellers, a literally huge opportunity to change the microclimate of Athens, to reduce the temperature during peak hours in Attica, to vastly improve the lives of the city's residents is being sacrificed on the altar of the huge profitability of very expensive Real Estate. Its concreting is being promoted, the construction of a huge new settlement of luxury housing, thousands of square meters of cement. The mountains of Attica, instead of being organized areas of rest and recreation for the working people, are withering away.
