And we are not exaggerating. Even central figures of "environmental organizations" accept that a totally green agriculture with zero emissions would lead to a multiplication of hunger, since more than 50% of the world's people rely on nitrogenous fertilizers for their food. The green transition, therefore, comes at a huge cost to the working classes. The notorious invocation of the so-called 'climate crisis' is being used as a scare tactic. It is used as the propaganda tool with which to explain to the working people's strata that it is necessary to starve, it is necessary not to be able to keep warm, it is necessary not to be able to move, otherwise the planet is in danger of a huge climate catastrophe.
