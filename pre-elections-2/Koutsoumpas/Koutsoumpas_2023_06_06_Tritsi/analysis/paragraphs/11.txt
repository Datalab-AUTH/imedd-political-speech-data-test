The treasure of the environment is abundant. The ruling parties and those seeking the votes of working people have no interest in our natural environment. These examples prove that the environment and its protection are being exploited as a propaganda scheme to hide a different objective: ensuring the profitability of big capital. The so-called green transition policy attempts to solve the problem of over-accumulation of capital, which has been the major problem that capitalism and its government managers cannot successfully address in the last 20 years. This problem leads to capitalist crises, antagonisms, and wars. Capitalism deals with this problem by destroying a significant part of capital to keep the machine of capitalist profitability running. The environment is the perfect method to promote the "creative destruction" of capital to deal with the problem of over-accumulation. They exploit the destruction of the environment that they themselves bring about and the real need for an upgraded natural environment. Their aim is to carry out a massive destruction of invested capital, first in energy, transport, means of production, and lastly in people's housing, to find an outlet for profitable investments for the over-accumulated capital of the monopoly groups.
