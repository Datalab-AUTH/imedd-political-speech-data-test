Here in the neighborhoods of West Athens, we have taken a step forward with the significant strengthening of the KKE in terms of votes and percentages, and the regaining of third place. Now we move forward with an even stronger KKE, the only genuine, popular, and militant opposition. More people can now choose the KKE's ballot paper because they understand what the KKE has been saying from the very beginning: that New Democracy, Syriza, and PASOK have a common anti-people's program and agree on the basic, key, strategic issues. They cannot hide this, no matter how much they argue during the election campaign about whether or not their programs are costed.
