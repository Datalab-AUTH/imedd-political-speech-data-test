Let's consider how different the situation would be if the workers and the people were in control of power and the economy. Let us imagine how much better we could live if decisions about what to produce, how much to produce, where to produce, and how to produce were not based on capitalist profit, but rather on the needs of the ruling class, on the commitments of the EU and NATO. This radically different situation has a name: social ownership of the concentrated means of production, with scientific central planning and workers' control. It is the radically different workers' and people's state, the new society of socialism, which can ensure the welfare of the people. Only workers' power, free from capitalist ownership of the means of production and the profit motive, can scientifically plan and develop production based on the total needs of society. It is the active, daily role of the workers in making, implementing, and controlling decisions.
