Hope lies in our own strength, in the organisation of our own struggle. And the dynamics of this popular force, when it decides to take its fate into its own hands, is very strong. We, the forces of the KKE, are at the forefront of the struggle against the new Greek-American Agreement, in order to immediately disengage the country from participation in the dangerous war plans of NATO and to close the bases of death. Life has proven to us that hope lies in the path of subversion. The forces of the KKE are constantly involved in struggles in all regions of the country.
