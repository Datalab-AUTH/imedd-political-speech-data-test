Let's consider electricity. The skyrocketing cost of electricity in recent years and the fact that almost half of the workers in our country are in a state of energy poverty are ultimately due to the policy of "green transition." The replacement of cheap lignite energy with expensive energy from wind turbines, the choice of imported LNG as a strategic fuel for power generation, and the huge profits of the electricity groups correspond to the very expensive tariffs of the energy groups, the huge profits of the wind turbine companies, and the profits of the shipowners who transport LNG. Let us consider modern electric cars. The replacement of old petrol cars with electric cars means that the vast majority of workers will no longer have their own means of transport with similar capabilities. Electric cars are expensive, break down quickly, and have limited range. In other words, they lead to the restriction of the mobility of a large proportion of workers. Let us consider the energy upgrade of buildings, which appears as a medicine but translates into tens of thousands of euros that the working people's family must pay and which is now compulsory in order to proceed with the notarial deeds.
