An even more characteristic example is the onslaught of so-called "green energy" in all the mountains of our country, from Alexandroupolis to Crete, from Epirus to southern Laconia. Hundreds and thousands of huge wind turbines are springing up like mushrooms on the mountaintops, destroying forests and mountain ecosystems with the thousands of cubic meters of concrete needed, the thousands of kilometers of mountain roads that have to be opened, and the thousands of kilometers of new electric cables running through forests and settlements, literally destroying the environment. Now, the next target after the mountains, after the rocky islets, after the areas of immense cultural interest, the next target is the sea itself.
