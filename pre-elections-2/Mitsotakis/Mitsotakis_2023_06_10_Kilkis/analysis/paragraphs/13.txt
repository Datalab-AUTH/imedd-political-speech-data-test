In this ballot box, friends, there is essentially only one convincing proposal for governance. This is the message that the Greek people sent to the ballot box on May 21 when they rewarded hard work and consistency because I kept my promises to you during the 2019 election. They rewarded political decency and said no to toxicity, division, hatred, and a bleak Greece. They voted for a brighter, more optimistic Greece, and we have every right today to hope that things will get better. Better days are ahead of us, but they are only possible with a stable and strong government of New Democracy. That is why it is so important in these elections to have a stable and strong parliamentary majority. I firmly believe that, as in the first four years, we need a strong majority to make great changes happen.
