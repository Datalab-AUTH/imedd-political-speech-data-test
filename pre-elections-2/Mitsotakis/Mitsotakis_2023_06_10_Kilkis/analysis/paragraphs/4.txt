And I want to send a message from Kilkis, from the northern end of the country: the policy of guarding our country's borders will continue without any discounts. The fence in Evros will be completed. Our border guards will become more and more numerous, and everyone will know that Greece is a country that has borders on land, in the air, and at sea, and we have an obligation to guard these borders. And this strong Greece, this patriotic Greece, this Greece of social sensitivity, is a Greece that we envision, and I ask you to join us in building it even more solidly.
