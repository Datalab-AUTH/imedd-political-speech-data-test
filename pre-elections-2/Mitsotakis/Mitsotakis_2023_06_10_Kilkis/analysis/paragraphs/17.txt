But I do. I also want to ask you to do one more thing. When I look at the electoral rates, more broadly in Northern Greece, in our Macedonia, but especially here in the region of Kilkis, I notice that there are some smaller parties to the right of New Democracy that have achieved rates that are not desirable. I want to repeat what I said in Oreokastro. If some people believe that there are bits and pieces unknown to all of us with hidden positions that they believe express faith and Orthodoxy more authentically, they are wrong. Orthodoxy unites, not divides; no one is more faithful than another. And no one has the right to engage in politics thinking that they have the favor of the Church. The Church has made it clear, hasn't it? "Caesar's to Caesar and God's to God."
