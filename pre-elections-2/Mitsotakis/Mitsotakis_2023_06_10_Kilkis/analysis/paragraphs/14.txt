The last thing the country needs today, in this difficult geopolitical environment that we are in, with Turkey having finished its own electoral issues and re-elected a strong President Erdoğan, is an unstable government. Will your government support a strong, stable one after the elections? One that will start working on June 25, with the vote taking place on June 26. We will roll up our sleeves and get to work. Will you be more experienced? After four years of governing, during which we have faced a myriad of challenges, are you now more prepared and equipped with more financial tools at your disposal? It is important to note the resources that our government has secured from the €31 billion Recovery Fund, which will provide additional resources for our country. These resources are the result of our own negotiations in 2021, and will be used for regional and rural development.
