That is why I ask you to make this effort together to further increase our percentages. To those of our fellow citizens who have patriotic sensibilities - and I believe that we all fall into this category - let us remind them who brought the Rafale to the country, who ordered the new frigates, who strengthened our Armed Forces to such an extent that today Greece can claim and command respect. Who made our country an undisputed factor of geopolitical stability in the Eastern Mediterranean? Who made Alexandroupolis an energy hub for the whole Mediterranean? They did not just succeed, they succeeded.
