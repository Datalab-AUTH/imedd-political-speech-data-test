The church unites and stays away from parties. We respect the constitutional enshrinement of the roles of church and state. We have stood by the church in the very difficult issues it has had over the past four years, but we have never thought of instrumentalizing the faith of the Greek people. We will not do so, and you must not allow anyone to do so.
