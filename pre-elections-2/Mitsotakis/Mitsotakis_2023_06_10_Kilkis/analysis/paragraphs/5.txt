Many times, during the election campaign that we conducted before the ballot box on May 21st, I likened my dream for our country to an unfinished house. We have laid the foundations, we have started building the floors, but we have not yet finished the job. The work must be completed with a second four-year term of New Democracy, with a strong, stable parliamentary majority. To get us faster on the road to growth, to create more well-paid jobs, and to support productive investment.
