Because we are all here today, friends, there is a second round of elections. The June 25th ballot is unnecessary because if the May 21st elections had been held under the same electoral system, New Democracy would already have a stable and strong majority. The slogan "you shout you are and will be the Prime Minister" is not applicable as there is currently a caretaker government due to some people rushing to impose simple proportional representation. The country is suffering from an unnecessary second election to validate the May 21st result. The citizens will not change their minds, but our percentage will be higher, not lower.
