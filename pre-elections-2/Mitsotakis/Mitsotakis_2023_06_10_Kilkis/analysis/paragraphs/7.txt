And of course, we must take this opportunity to correct the failures of the past, to correct mistakes that may have been made, and outstanding issues concerning basic infrastructure projects. We must correct them. You have a right, you have a right here in Kilkis to grumble and complain about the fact that the road link to Thessaloniki has not yet been completed. I am in constant communication with Apostolos Tzitzikostas; he is here somewhere. You have my personal commitment that if necessary, we will do whatever it takes to declare a contractor bankrupt to proceed with the project as soon as possible so that the road connection is completed and close this pending issue regarding the basic infrastructure of our regional unit. And that is just one example of how we will put into practice our commitment to turn the country into a vast construction site. The mayor knows all too well here that never before has local government had at its disposal more financial tools than in our time. The many projects that are going on in your municipality, the many projects that are going on in the province are the result of the support that this government has given to local government. Because we trust local government, first and second tier, and we want to work well with those policy implementers that are closer to you.
