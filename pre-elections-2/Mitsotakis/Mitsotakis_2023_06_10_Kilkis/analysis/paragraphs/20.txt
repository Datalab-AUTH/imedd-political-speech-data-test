So I would like us to go and tell those of our fellow citizens, and you in particular, who may not have chosen us in these elections that we can challenge them and win them. Let's make a bet together in the June 25 election. We have achieved a lot and we can achieve more. Here in Kilkis, let's go blue for Kilkis, blue for Macedonia, and blue for all of Greece. Let's write our own history together. Be well, thank you very much, good luck, and two seats in Kilkis. Good strength, good fight.
