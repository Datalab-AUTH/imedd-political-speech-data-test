I remember a visit that I made to your region in 2017. It must have been during a time when tragic situations were prevailing here, a little above in Idomeni. You remember them too. What is the current refugee situation here? It is much, much better. I made a commitment that we would solve this problem, and we have solved it. This is for all the local communities that were receiving refugees and migrants, but first and foremost, for our islands, our citizens, and our fellow citizens who are on Evros.
