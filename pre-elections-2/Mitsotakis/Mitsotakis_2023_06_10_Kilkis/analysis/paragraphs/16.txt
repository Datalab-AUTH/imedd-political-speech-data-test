I won't bore you any longer in the heat of the day by talking about what we want to do. I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, another big thank you for what you are doing and have done for the Southwest. I also want to thank my old colleagues from New Democracy, who kept the party standing during difficult times. I see my fellow citizens coming with photos of Konstantinos Mitsotakis, who had so many friends here in Kilkis, and I remember the great battles we fought in the 80s and 90s. I wonder, who among you would have ever imagined that New Democracy could return to these percentages and have "4" in front of its percentage? But we did it!
