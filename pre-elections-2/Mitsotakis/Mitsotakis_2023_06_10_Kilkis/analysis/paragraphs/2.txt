Mr. Mayor, Mr. Regional Governor, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit Kilkis today, as I mentioned earlier, to emphasize how important I consider your support in this great effort that we started four years ago and continue to pursue. The important work that we started four years ago. And indeed, the citizens rewarded this work at the ballot box on May 21st, rewarding the progress that the country has made; rewarding a policy of economic growth with an emphasis on social justice, and yes, he is right. The County Chairman was correct when he said in his introduction that they rewarded the citizens and a robust foreign policy that kept the country safe and enhanced its standing around the world.
