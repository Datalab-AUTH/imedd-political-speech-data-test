People have already voted and they will vote again for their future. They will vote again for better jobs, for keeping our country on a growth path, and for a social and fair Greece. They will vote for a government that has proven it can stand by its citizens in times of difficulty, because we will be very well here. I am here on your main pedestrian street. Remember that all these shops were closed during the pandemic, and if it had not been for New Democracy spending tens of billions of euros to support businesses and workers, we would be facing a very big crisis today.
