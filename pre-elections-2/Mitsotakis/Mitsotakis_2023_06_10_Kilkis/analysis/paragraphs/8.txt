The problems and this policy will continue over the next four years, as will a policy of firm and renegotiated support for the new democracy in the NHS, my friends. We will build the new NHS in defiance of those who hypocritically claim to care about public health. But because we also remember their works and their days when they were in office, people know that yes, there are still problems. Let us have no illusions. But you know if today your hospital has more doctors and more nurses than it used to have, and I want you to know that for me, supporting the NHS, supporting the ambulance service, being able to carry out evacuations quickly and safely - wherever our fellow citizens are - this is a project that I will personally undertake and that we will implement in the second four years.
