Thank you for this amazing welcome. Thank you for your love. I return it. There was no way I could complete an election season without passing by my beloved Kilkis, here in the heart of Macedonia. You know, after all, that the ties between Crete and Macedonia are powerful. I do not forget that my grandfather Kyriakos Mitsotakis fought in the first Balkan war at the head of a corps of Cretan volunteers. Here in Kilkis today, you are sending a message that is spreading throughout Greece. All of Greece is blue, and Kilkis is even bluer. Your presence here today, in broad daylight, in the heat of the day, is particularly moving and arms me with even greater strength. Let's go in 2 weeks to finish the work we started on the 21st of May. And as a friend of mine in Oraeokastro, where I was just now, aptly said to me, we are going to achieve heatwave rates in the new republic of Gerasimov. In the elections of 25 June.
