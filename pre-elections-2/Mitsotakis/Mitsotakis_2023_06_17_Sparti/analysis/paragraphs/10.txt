And since we are talking about Sparta, let me say a few words about how we can imagine Sparta four years from now. First of all, by 2026, Sparta will have the most modern hospital in the country, donated by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. This hospital will be completed on time, despite some minor difficulties that have arisen, and will enable Laconia to be a real leader in how we envision the new National Health System: with good primary care structures but also with state-of-the-art hospitals, with 10,000 nursing and medical staff recruited to cover all the needs of the NHS. And with the ability to provide preventive examinations for millions of our fellow citizens, so that we can detect diseases before they come knocking at our door.
