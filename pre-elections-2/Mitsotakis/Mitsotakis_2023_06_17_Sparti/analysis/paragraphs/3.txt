It is interesting to see who the New Republic is. New Democracy is primarily composed of the old, traditional fighters who kept the party standing during difficult times. However, the New Democracy of 2023 brings together our fellow citizens who have never voted for us before - and I want to thank them for this. Many citizens hesitated to vote for us in 2019 but voted for us in 2023 because they were convinced by our work and asked us to implement our program faster. I remember coming to Sparta before the internal elections in 2016. I pledged to renew New Democracy and make it a great party of power again. I kept my commitment to you. The best is still ahead of us, my friends. Remember my words, the best is ahead of us.
