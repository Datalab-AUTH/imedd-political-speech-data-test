At the same time, however, Sparta will have one of the most beautiful museums in the world. The studies have been completed. I personally pledge that I will secure the approximately 40 million that the new museum in Sparta needs so that you can finally have the museum you need. And on the site of the old museum, which will also be remodeled, you will essentially have two museums, the old and the new. So that Sparta can, at last, capitalize in practice on this huge and powerful brand that it has. The whole world knows Sparta and the Spartans, but how many people actually come to visit Sparta to get to know it well? So that is my goal for Sparta in the next four years, for Laconia in the next four years, together with the promotion of the other unique heritage sites. In Mistra, as you know, almost EUR 10 million worth of works are being carried out. They will be completed by 2025, and Mystras will be another addition to the cultural potential of the region. One more reason why someone will come and visit Laconia.
