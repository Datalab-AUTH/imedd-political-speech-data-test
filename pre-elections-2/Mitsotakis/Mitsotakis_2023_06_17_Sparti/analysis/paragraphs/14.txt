This is the Greece of the future that we envision, and I ask you to walk together to build it, brick by brick. For a homeland that will not be a tail but will truly be a protagonist of developments. Once again, I want to convey to you how heavily I feel the responsibility that the Greek people have placed on us. You know, being able to increase your percentage while in government is something that New Democracy has never achieved before. We achieved it for the first time, and we will achieve it again now. But with high rates come high expectations. I just want to say one thing because I do not want to bore you any more today, in the sunshine, where you have waited for me with so much kindness and love. Let me tell you that I started from Athens in cloudy weather, but here in Laconia, there is sunshine, and there will be sunshine on 25 June. I want to tell you that - rest assured and be assured - I will be, we will be worthy of your trust. And the strong mandate that you will give us to change Greece will be able to be put into practice in the next four years. Four years from now, Greece will be a different country; it will be a much better country. So let's go together to continue this great effort that we have started. Let's go together to bring even higher rates here in Laconia. Let's go together for 50% in the municipality of Sparta, and let's go together to celebrate next Sunday a great victory for New Democracy, a victory for Greece. Steadily, boldly, and only forward. Thank you very much for your love. Fly the flags of the homeland, fly the flags of the party. Thank you very much, and goodbye. Be well. Goodbye.
