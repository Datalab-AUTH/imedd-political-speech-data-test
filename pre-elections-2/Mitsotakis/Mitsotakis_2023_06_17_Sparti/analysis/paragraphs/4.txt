The second four-year term of New Democracy will allow us to speed up the major changes that the country needs, strengthen the economy even more, launch and stabilize the growth dynamics that already exist in our country. I would like to remind you that in 2019, under relatively good international conditions, our country lagged behind in growth in the European Union. Today, we are a champion in growth, which means better wages, better incomes, more jobs, and better prospects for our country after a difficult decade.
