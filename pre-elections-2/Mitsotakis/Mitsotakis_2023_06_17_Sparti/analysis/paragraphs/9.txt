So we do not want to go back to that past. We want to move forward. We will move forward with a strong popular mandate and a stable government that can have the power to implement the great changes that the country needs. These big changes will have an impact on your own lives. One of your fellow citizens said to me as I was coming here, "Watch out for Sparta because Sparta is abandoned." I do not want any city or any region of our country to feel abandoned. All Greek citizens, regardless of where they live, will have equal rights and equal opportunities for prosperity.
