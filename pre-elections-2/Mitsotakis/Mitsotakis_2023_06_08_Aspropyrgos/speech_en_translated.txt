Thank you to our amazing UNNEDites who have been present throughout this past election season and have set their own special tone at every gathering. Mr. Mayor, dear candidates on the West Attica ballot paper, and friends, I am here today in Aspropyrgos, West Attica, first and foremost to say a big thank you for the unique percentage that we achieved here in West Attica, not only in Aspropyrgos. We exceeded 40%, and for me, this percentage is a reward for the great effort that we made in the past four years to keep society on its feet, put the economy on a growth path, and at the same time, keep the country safe in the midst of unprecedented difficulties.

The Mayor mentioned and remembered the great difficulties of the pandemic, but it was not only that. There was also an energy crisis and a neighbor who was aggressive for a whole four years. We overcame all these difficulties and, at the same time, we were consistent in the implementation of our electoral commitments. The Greek people rewarded us at the ballot box on May 21, increasing the share of the New Democracy vote and the absolute number of votes we received. But, friends, the work is not yet complete. The Mayor remembered that the municipalities were also captive to the system of proportional representation until we came along and enabled them to govern themselves effectively. Here we are, in the strange situation of having to claim a second electoral victory when we would have already had an independent government if the enhanced proportional representation electoral system had been in place in the previous election.

In other words, we are calling on citizens to reaffirm the choice they made in the previous election and to trust us again because nothing is over. The ballot box is empty, it will be empty on the morning of June 25th, and it is our duty to refill it with many New Democracy ballots. In this effort, I want you all to help us. We have set the bar high, and together we are setting it even higher for even better results in Aspropyrgos, for even better results in West Attica, not just for the 3rd but for the 4th seat, so that we can once again pleasantly surprise and so that we can embrace this great trust that the citizens are showing us. So that we can continue from June 26th with even greater appetite, with even greater determination, the important work that we have already launched.

The Mayor was mentioned, and I personally want to congratulate him for his long journey in local government. It is a luxury in politics to be able to leave on your own terms. But we had excellent cooperation with the Mayor. We have shown that we can support local government with financial tools that local government has never seen since the post-revolutionary period, so that we can make your everyday life better. This, of course, is also reflected in the overall political choices that we have made over the past four years and that we want to continue.

Our first concern has been and remains to have more and better jobs for all, with better wages. I believe that one of the reasons why our rate here in West Attica and in West Athens was so pleasantly surprising is precisely because people recognized this growth-oriented policy of ours that emphasized not just protection, but the creation of new jobs. The citizens of West Attica gave us credit for the fact that we saved the Elefsina and Skaramagas shipyards and not just protected jobs, but created the prospects for many more. I visited the Elefsina shipyards a few weeks ago. At that time, there were five ships, if I am not mistaken, inside. New ones are being added all the time, and it is a great joy to see the happiness on the faces of the workers who were anxious a year ago about whether they would be able to keep their jobs. Now they come to work in the morning full of optimism and know that they will have a job. They will have a job, and new jobs will be added to the shipyards.

The same is happening in Skaramanga, and the same will happen with a very important investment for your region, which our government has unblocked. I am referring to the freight center, which, as you know, was stalled due to a problematic contract. With a great deal of pressure and negotiation with the European Union, we finally managed to unblock it. It is an investment that will turn "Thriasio" into the largest freight center in the Balkans and will create up to 3,000 new jobs. These are new jobs, especially for young people in the region, a region which has a strong manufacturing industry. We are also moving forward with the organization of the informal industrial area so that we can attract more productive investment to the region.

But we are not forgetting the major infrastructure and transport projects that your region needs. An emblematic project, in which I believe very much, is the Western Attica Suburban Railway, a flagship project for how we perceive the expansion of fixed railways. It will enable all citizens of West Attica to communicate with Athens in an easy, fast, and safe way.

We do not forget that our obligation, my dear Mayor and friends, is also to continuously support social infrastructure, hospitals, health centers. For me personally, strengthening the National Health System is a central political priority for the next four years. The country will finally have a modern National Health System. We will hire 10,000 doctors and nurses, modernize emergency departments and health centers, invest in prevention and the Personal Doctor. We will also modernize and drastically intervene in ambulance services to prevent tragic incidents like the ones that have unfortunately monopolized media attention in recent days.

We know the weaknesses. We have never hidden the problems. Nor did we say that the country was transformed in four years and we solved all of our problems. But we also know that our citizens have rewarded us because we worked hard, because we put the economy on a growth path, and because, yes, Greece in 2023 is a much better country than it was in 2019. I invite you to continue this growth path and not to disturb it. This is, after all, the real issue of the 25 June ballot.

Because I believe that almost everyone knows who the first party will be, and that there is currently only one substantive proposal for governing the country. Our opponents are fighting over who will lead the center-left and who will be the opposition. That seems to be all they care about. They are abdicating their responsibility to govern the country. They say to us, "This is not our concern. You will be self-reliant anyway. Now let's go and see who will be first in the center-left block. Who will occupy the high penthouse?" I tell them that in elections, people vote for the government, not the opposition. They are voting for who will manage the country's destiny for the next four years, and that will ultimately be the choice that citizens make; a positive choice to reward a party that has proven it can combine a dynamic development policy with strong care and social concern for the weakest.

Sometimes we surprise our political opponents when we show our true progressive face. We demonstrate that some are progressive in words, while others are progressive in practice. We are ultimately concerned with our weaker fellow citizens and reducing inequalities. You are well aware that this government has left no one unprotected. We did not leave citizens, shops, or small and medium-sized enterprises unprotected during the pandemic.

We came in, paid salaries, and paid a refundable advance. If businesses here in Aspropyrgos are functioning, investing, and growing today, it is because they were kept alive by this government with tens of billions of euros during the pandemic.

We did the same thing during the energy crisis. Do you remember when we were faced with very steep increases in electricity bills? We said, "We have to do something here." We taxed the electricity producers, took the revenue from that tax, and put it back as a one-off subsidy on every household's electricity bill. You could see it every month in your bills - what you would pay without the government subsidy and what you pay with the government subsidy.

This policy, which combines growth with social justice, has been rewarded by the citizens and has also been rewarded with something else, friends: a policy that prioritizes the security and independence of the country by protecting the borders of the homeland and investing in the Armed Forces; a policy of national pride, with the voice of Greece being heard and reaching everywhere. This is not only satisfying when we see that Greece is not the problematic country in Europe, but it also has an effect. Because when we go to Brussels and negotiate European resources, these resources eventually come back to Greek society.

The Western Attica Suburban Railway will be partly financed by the Recovery Fund. These are additional resources of €31 billion that this government has been able to secure. Many of the programs that the municipalities are running are also European funds; some come from the NSRF, some come from the Recovery Fund. It is European money that we have been able to secure precisely because we have strengthened the credibility of the country. Greece is now the first country, look, of all the European countries to absorb the Recovery Fund resources; we have already received €12 billion. This is money that did not exist; we brought it to our country. And obviously, it is not money that only favors a few big players; it has a substantial development and social footprint.

I want to stress one more thing because I know that I am in an area where you are concerned about the issue of security and crime. We have taken steps to address the problem and have strengthened the police stations in the area. We must do more. We say clearly and without footnotes or asterisks that for us, the security of the citizen is a non-negotiable priority and prerequisite. It is a prerequisite for progress, freedom, and prosperity.

We know that we still have work to do in this area. However, have confidence in us because this government has proven that it can achieve targets when it sets them. We will also achieve the targets we have set after June 25th so that we can take Greece higher. All Greeks should feel that they have the right to prosperity and equal opportunities, and they should see a better future for our country.

This is ultimately the big stake of the elections: whether we will continue on this course or whether we will enter a regime of political instability. The country - and I will not tire of saying this - needs a stable and strong government in the coming days. And this requires a stable and strong parliamentary majority. We will achieve this strong parliamentary majority and we will increase our percentages even more, both here in West Attica and in Aspropyrgos. I believe that today there are fellow citizens who may not have even voted for us in the May elections, but who are thinking of making the choice this time and trusting us. I would like to ask you - you may know some of them - to go and talk to them. Personal contact in politics, you know, always has a very great importance, and ask them to take the step of trusting us.

They should not listen to the voices and sirens of smaller parties, especially those who claim to be super-patriots and shout on television about what they would do if they ever had the responsibility of governing the country - which they obviously won't. Remind them that true patriots are judged by their actions, not their words. This government has shown great patriotic sensitivity in all matters related to defending the country's national interests.

Just take a closer look at what's going on here in Elefsina, which I often visit as it's where I use government aircraft for official travel. What's happening at all the airports across the country with the new aircraft, such as the Rafale and F-35s that will be the spearhead of the Air Force, and the major intervention we've made to ensure all our firefighting aircraft, which fly from Elefsina, are airworthy for the fire season.

All of this and much more are important steps that have been taken during this four-year period. Many times, we forget them or take them for granted. For example, the digital state and the gov.gr revolution. The fact that we can now use our computer or telephone to communicate with the state, saving hours of inconvenience, is now taken for granted. But it was not a given four years ago. This government has made the digital revolution a reality in the public sector. So when we talk about a better state, we have the credibility to implement these policies.

So we have a plan, a mood, and a vision for Greece for the next four years. What we need, quite simply, is to finish the work that we started at the ballot box on May 21. On June 25, all of Greece will be blue again, and on June 26, we will start working for a better Greece that will aim even higher, steadily and boldly, for the great changes that our country needs. Be well, thank you very much. During my next visit to West Attica, we will aim to confirm the even better rates we can achieve. Be well. Good strength and victory. Thank you very much.
