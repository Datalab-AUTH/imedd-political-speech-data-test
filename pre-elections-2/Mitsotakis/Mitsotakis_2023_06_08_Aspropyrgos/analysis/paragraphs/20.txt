Just take a closer look at what's going on here in Elefsina, which I often visit as it's where I use government aircraft for official travel. What's happening at all the airports across the country with the new aircraft, such as the Rafale and F-35s that will be the spearhead of the Air Force, and the major intervention we've made to ensure all our firefighting aircraft, which fly from Elefsina, are airworthy for the fire season.
