Our first concern has been and remains to have more and better jobs for all, with better wages. I believe that one of the reasons why our rate here in West Attica and in West Athens was so pleasantly surprising is precisely because people recognized this growth-oriented policy of ours that emphasized not just protection, but the creation of new jobs. The citizens of West Attica gave us credit for the fact that we saved the Elefsina and Skaramagas shipyards and not just protected jobs, but created the prospects for many more. I visited the Elefsina shipyards a few weeks ago. At that time, there were five ships, if I am not mistaken, inside. New ones are being added all the time, and it is a great joy to see the happiness on the faces of the workers who were anxious a year ago about whether they would be able to keep their jobs. Now they come to work in the morning full of optimism and know that they will have a job. They will have a job, and new jobs will be added to the shipyards.
