Because I believe that almost everyone knows who the first party will be, and that there is currently only one substantive proposal for governing the country. Our opponents are fighting over who will lead the center-left and who will be the opposition. That seems to be all they care about. They are abdicating their responsibility to govern the country. They say to us, "This is not our concern. You will be self-reliant anyway. Now let's go and see who will be first in the center-left block. Who will occupy the high penthouse?" I tell them that in elections, people vote for the government, not the opposition. They are voting for who will manage the country's destiny for the next four years, and that will ultimately be the choice that citizens make; a positive choice to reward a party that has proven it can combine a dynamic development policy with strong care and social concern for the weakest.
