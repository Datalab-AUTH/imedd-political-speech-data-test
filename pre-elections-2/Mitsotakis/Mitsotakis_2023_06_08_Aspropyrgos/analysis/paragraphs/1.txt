Thank you to our amazing UNNEDites who have been present throughout this past election season and have set their own special tone at every gathering. Mr. Mayor, dear candidates on the West Attica ballot paper, and friends, I am here today in Aspropyrgos, West Attica, first and foremost to say a big thank you for the unique percentage that we achieved here in West Attica, not only in Aspropyrgos. We exceeded 40%, and for me, this percentage is a reward for the great effort that we made in the past four years to keep society on its feet, put the economy on a growth path, and at the same time, keep the country safe in the midst of unprecedented difficulties.
