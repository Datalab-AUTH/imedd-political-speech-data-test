We do not forget that our obligation, my dear Mayor and friends, is also to continuously support social infrastructure, hospitals, health centers. For me personally, strengthening the National Health System is a central political priority for the next four years. The country will finally have a modern National Health System. We will hire 10,000 doctors and nurses, modernize emergency departments and health centers, invest in prevention and the Personal Doctor. We will also modernize and drastically intervene in ambulance services to prevent tragic incidents like the ones that have unfortunately monopolized media attention in recent days.
