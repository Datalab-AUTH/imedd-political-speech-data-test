All of this and much more are important steps that have been taken during this four-year period. Many times, we forget them or take them for granted. For example, the digital state and the gov.gr revolution. The fact that we can now use our computer or telephone to communicate with the state, saving hours of inconvenience, is now taken for granted. But it was not a given four years ago. This government has made the digital revolution a reality in the public sector. So when we talk about a better state, we have the credibility to implement these policies.
