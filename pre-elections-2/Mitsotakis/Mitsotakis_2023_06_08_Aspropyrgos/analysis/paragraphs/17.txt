We know that we still have work to do in this area. However, have confidence in us because this government has proven that it can achieve targets when it sets them. We will also achieve the targets we have set after June 25th so that we can take Greece higher. All Greeks should feel that they have the right to prosperity and equal opportunities, and they should see a better future for our country.
