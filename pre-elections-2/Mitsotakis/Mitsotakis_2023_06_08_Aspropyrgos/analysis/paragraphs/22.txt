So we have a plan, a mood, and a vision for Greece for the next four years. What we need, quite simply, is to finish the work that we started at the ballot box on May 21. On June 25, all of Greece will be blue again, and on June 26, we will start working for a better Greece that will aim even higher, steadily and boldly, for the great changes that our country needs. Be well, thank you very much. During my next visit to West Attica, we will aim to confirm the even better rates we can achieve. Be well. Good strength and victory. Thank you very much.
