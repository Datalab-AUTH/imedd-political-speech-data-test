The Mayor was mentioned, and I personally want to congratulate him for his long journey in local government. It is a luxury in politics to be able to leave on your own terms. But we had excellent cooperation with the Mayor. We have shown that we can support local government with financial tools that local government has never seen since the post-revolutionary period, so that we can make your everyday life better. This, of course, is also reflected in the overall political choices that we have made over the past four years and that we want to continue.
