The Western Attica Suburban Railway will be partly financed by the Recovery Fund. These are additional resources of €31 billion that this government has been able to secure. Many of the programs that the municipalities are running are also European funds; some come from the NSRF, some come from the Recovery Fund. It is European money that we have been able to secure precisely because we have strengthened the credibility of the country. Greece is now the first country, look, of all the European countries to absorb the Recovery Fund resources; we have already received €12 billion. This is money that did not exist; we brought it to our country. And obviously, it is not money that only favors a few big players; it has a substantial development and social footprint.
