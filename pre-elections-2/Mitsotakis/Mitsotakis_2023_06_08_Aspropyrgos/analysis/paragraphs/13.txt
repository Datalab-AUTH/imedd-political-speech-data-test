We did the same thing during the energy crisis. Do you remember when we were faced with very steep increases in electricity bills? We said, "We have to do something here." We taxed the electricity producers, took the revenue from that tax, and put it back as a one-off subsidy on every household's electricity bill. You could see it every month in your bills - what you would pay without the government subsidy and what you pay with the government subsidy.
