In other words, we are calling on citizens to reaffirm the choice they made in the previous election and to trust us again because nothing is over. The ballot box is empty, it will be empty on the morning of June 25th, and it is our duty to refill it with many New Democracy ballots. In this effort, I want you all to help us. We have set the bar high, and together we are setting it even higher for even better results in Aspropyrgos, for even better results in West Attica, not just for the 3rd but for the 4th seat, so that we can once again pleasantly surprise and so that we can embrace this great trust that the citizens are showing us. So that we can continue from June 26th with even greater appetite, with even greater determination, the important work that we have already launched.
