I want to stress one more thing because I know that I am in an area where you are concerned about the issue of security and crime. We have taken steps to address the problem and have strengthened the police stations in the area. We must do more. We say clearly and without footnotes or asterisks that for us, the security of the citizen is a non-negotiable priority and prerequisite. It is a prerequisite for progress, freedom, and prosperity.
