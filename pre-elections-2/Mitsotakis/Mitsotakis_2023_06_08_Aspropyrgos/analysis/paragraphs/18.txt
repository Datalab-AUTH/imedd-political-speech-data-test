This is ultimately the big stake of the elections: whether we will continue on this course or whether we will enter a regime of political instability. The country - and I will not tire of saying this - needs a stable and strong government in the coming days. And this requires a stable and strong parliamentary majority. We will achieve this strong parliamentary majority and we will increase our percentages even more, both here in West Attica and in Aspropyrgos. I believe that today there are fellow citizens who may not have even voted for us in the May elections, but who are thinking of making the choice this time and trusting us. I would like to ask you - you may know some of them - to go and talk to them. Personal contact in politics, you know, always has a very great importance, and ask them to take the step of trusting us.
