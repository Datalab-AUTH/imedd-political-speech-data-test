We know the weaknesses. We have never hidden the problems. Nor did we say that the country was transformed in four years and we solved all of our problems. But we also know that our citizens have rewarded us because we worked hard, because we put the economy on a growth path, and because, yes, Greece in 2023 is a much better country than it was in 2019. I invite you to continue this growth path and not to disturb it. This is, after all, the real issue of the 25 June ballot.
