The same is happening in Skaramanga, and the same will happen with a very important investment for your region, which our government has unblocked. I am referring to the freight center, which, as you know, was stalled due to a problematic contract. With a great deal of pressure and negotiation with the European Union, we finally managed to unblock it. It is an investment that will turn "Thriasio" into the largest freight center in the Balkans and will create up to 3,000 new jobs. These are new jobs, especially for young people in the region, a region which has a strong manufacturing industry. We are also moving forward with the organization of the informal industrial area so that we can attract more productive investment to the region.
