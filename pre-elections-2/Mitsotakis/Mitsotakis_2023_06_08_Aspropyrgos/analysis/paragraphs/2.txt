The Mayor mentioned and remembered the great difficulties of the pandemic, but it was not only that. There was also an energy crisis and a neighbor who was aggressive for a whole four years. We overcame all these difficulties and, at the same time, we were consistent in the implementation of our electoral commitments. The Greek people rewarded us at the ballot box on May 21, increasing the share of the New Democracy vote and the absolute number of votes we received. But, friends, the work is not yet complete. The Mayor remembered that the municipalities were also captive to the system of proportional representation until we came along and enabled them to govern themselves effectively. Here we are, in the strange situation of having to claim a second electoral victory when we would have already had an independent government if the enhanced proportional representation electoral system had been in place in the previous election.
