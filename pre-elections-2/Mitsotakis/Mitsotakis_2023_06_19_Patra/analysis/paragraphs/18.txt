The citizens are setting the bar high for us. They give us the power to make big changes happen. Here in Patras, I assure them that we will rise to the occasion and lead the country steadily, boldly, forward, to put our program into practice. Four years from now, Greece will be a different country, a much better country than it is in 2023. Just as Greece in 2023 is already a much better country than Greece in 2019.
