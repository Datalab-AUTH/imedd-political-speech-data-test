Since we have the UNNEDites from our university here, I would like to extend a special thank you to our youth. Let me reiterate how much importance I place on public education, supporting our universities, and creating outward-looking universities that are ultimately connected to the labor market. Universities where libraries, not sledgehammers, are dominant. We want universities to be centers of knowledge, excellence, and freedom of expression, not havens for lawlessness and delinquency, as some may imagine.
