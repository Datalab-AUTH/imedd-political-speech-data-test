But, friends, let me tell you about another important priority of the second four-year term, and that is the support of the National Health System. I am tired of responding to the fake news of the opposition that claims that the intention of the New Democracy is to privatize the NHS. We tell them clearly: we will build the new public National Health System, which will provide quality healthcare to every Greek. We will hire 10,000 doctors and nurses over the next four years. We will rebuild the emergency departments in our major hospitals. We will support our health centers. We will emphasize primary care, the Personal Doctor, and screening; we will work with the private sector where necessary, but providing - and I stress this - free health services to all our insured citizens. Because that is what our tradition demands.
