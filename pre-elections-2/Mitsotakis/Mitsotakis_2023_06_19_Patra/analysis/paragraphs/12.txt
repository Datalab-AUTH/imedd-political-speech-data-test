We were all shocked, friends, by the tragic shipwreck that took place off Pylos. But I believe we were also all angered by the fact that the only concern of some today seems to be blaming our Coast Guard, rather than highlighting the role of the wretched traffickers. All those who take advantage of human suffering and put persecuted people on board dinghies to take them on an extremely dangerous journey that should never have started in the first place.
