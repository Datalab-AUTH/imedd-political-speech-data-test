As we implement a policy that will continue to strengthen the country's defense, protect our sovereignty and sovereign rights, and highlight the role of our country as a pillar of stability throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, some may be annoyed - both inside and outside Greece - that our country is equipping and strengthening our Armed Forces. To them, I say: sorry for your annoyance, but this policy will continue under the next government of New Democracy. In 2028, God willing, we will receive the first state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft, which will find their permanent home in Andravida, here in your region. Greece will continue to protect its borders, which are also the borders of the European Union.
