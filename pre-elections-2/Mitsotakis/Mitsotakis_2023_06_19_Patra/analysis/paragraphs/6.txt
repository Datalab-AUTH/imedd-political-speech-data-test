And you, Mr. Regional Governor, especially in Patras, Western Greece, are well aware of your country's important growth potential. Together, we will be able to implement it. I want Patras to be the protagonist of growth in the next decade, with many well-paid jobs and important infrastructure projects that we have already discussed and are being launched. Finally, with the completion of the road - Karmaniola - connecting Pyrgos with Patras. The project, as I have committed to you, is already being implemented and will be ready in two years.
