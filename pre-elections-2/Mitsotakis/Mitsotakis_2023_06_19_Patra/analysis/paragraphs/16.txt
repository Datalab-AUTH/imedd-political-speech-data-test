I hear "we will have Mitsotakis as Prime Minister", because that is what the sovereign Greek people will ultimately choose. The latest narrative of a faltering opposition is this: "Don't vote", it says, "New Democracy, because we don't want Mitsotakis authoritarian and all-powerful". I reply that only the sovereign Greek people are all-powerful, and it is they who ultimately determine the parliamentary balance in the next Parliament.
