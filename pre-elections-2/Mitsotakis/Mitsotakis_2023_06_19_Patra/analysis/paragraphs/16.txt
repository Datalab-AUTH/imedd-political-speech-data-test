I hear "We will have Mitsotakis as Prime Minister" because that is what the sovereign Greek people will ultimately choose. The latest narrative of a faltering opposition is this: "Don't vote for New Democracy because we don't want Mitsotakis to be authoritarian and all-powerful." I reply that only the sovereign Greek people are all-powerful, and it is they who ultimately determine the parliamentary balance in the next Parliament.
