We, friends, have been pursuing a strict but fair policy on refugees for four years now. In 2019, I told you that I would drastically reduce the migratory flows affecting the East Aegean islands, and we have kept this commitment. This policy, apart from its national security dimension, is also profoundly humanitarian. Do you know why? The fewer boats that sail in the Aegean and the Mediterranean, the less chance there is of a catastrophic shipwreck like the one we experienced in the last few days. Essentially, through our policy, we have crushed the traffickers. And we will continue this policy for the next four years if the Greek people trust us. We will protect our borders, and the Coast Guard will always be there to save human lives. It has saved thousands of persecuted people stranded at sea.
