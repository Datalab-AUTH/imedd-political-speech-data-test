It is no coincidence, friends, that my commitment for the next four years is to prioritize better wages for every Greek, with a minimum wage of 950 euros and an average wage of 1,500 euros. We can achieve these goals because we know that better wages come with increased investment and making our country a growth engine in the region once again.
