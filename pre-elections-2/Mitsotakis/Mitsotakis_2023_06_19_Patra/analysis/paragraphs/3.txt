But I am here to give you a simple message: the work is not over. On the morning of June 25th, the polls will be empty. At the end of the day, they should be filled with millions of New Democracy ballots. This is our mission and we will achieve it. We will accomplish it so that we can continue this important work that we started four years ago. When going through very great difficulties and unprecedented crises, we managed to keep the ship of the country safe. Above all, we managed to put Greece on a path of development and excellence.
