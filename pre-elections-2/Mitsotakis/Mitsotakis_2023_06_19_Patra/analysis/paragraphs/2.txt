You know, I have been to Patras many times since 2004, when I was first elected as a Member of Parliament. I remember then - and my brotherly friend Michael Bekiris is here - I was at Vassilis' christening. No matter how many times I have been there, I have never, ever encountered this atmosphere for New Democracy. I want to say a big, special thank you, but what we achieved, friends, was not by chance. Nor was it simply the result of a very good election campaign, which we conducted together four weeks before the elections on May 21. I firmly believe that this ballot box has closed a circle for our country, closed a circle of division, closed a circle of blackness. And a circle of unity and a circle of optimism has opened for New Democracy, strong for the homeland, strong for the Greece we really want, the Greece we can achieve.
