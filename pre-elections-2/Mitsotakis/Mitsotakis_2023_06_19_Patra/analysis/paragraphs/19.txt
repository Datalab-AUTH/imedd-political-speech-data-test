I want to ask you to join me in this final great effort. To all of our officers, I say that we must not let any potential vote go to waste. We must find our fellow citizens who did not choose us at the ballot box on May 21 - some may have chosen other parties to our left, some may have chosen minor parties to our right - and explain to them that their vote matters greatly.
