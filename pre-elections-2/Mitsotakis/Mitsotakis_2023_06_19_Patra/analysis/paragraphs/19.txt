So I want to ask you to join me in this last great effort. To all of our officers, I say to you that we must not let any potential vote go to waste. We must find our fellow citizens who did not even choose us at the ballot box on May 21 - some may have chosen other parties to our left, some may have chosen minor parties to our right - and explain to them that their vote matters a great deal.
