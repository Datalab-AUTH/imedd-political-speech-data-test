If there is one thing I will agree with Alexis Tsipras on, it is that in this election, yes, we are voting for our lives. We are voting for better wages, better education, better healthcare, and a safer Greece. We are voting for a government that, if it has to manage a crisis, knows where it stands and how to respond to any contingency. We are voting for all of these things.
