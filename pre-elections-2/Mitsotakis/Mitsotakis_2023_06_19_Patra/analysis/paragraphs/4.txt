This four-year journey was rewarded by the citizens, and they merged into New Democracy. Citizens who had not supported us in the past came and rewarded us for what we achieved. However, they asked us for one more thing. In the mandate which they gave us, they told us to "run faster to make the great changes our country needs. Keep going, keep going, keep Greece on a growth track. Continue to support, first and foremost, the weakest in our society. Put the emphasis on wages."
