So that is what we will vote on. On Friday evening, sometime after our final speech in Athens, the campaign lights will go out. I will go home, spend a day with my family, and on Sunday, June 25th, for one day, the responsibility passes to all of you. The responsibility passes to all of you; that is the beauty of democracy. It is you who ultimately choose who should govern the country for the next four years. I have great confidence in the judgment of the Greek people and I am sure that I will be back here in Patras as the elected Prime Minister of our country so that we can continue together on this beautiful journey that we have started. Be well, thank you very much, have a good race and with victory. And here again, winners for the Western Greece that we deserve, for the Patras that we deserve. Thank you very much. Good race.
