Good morning, Blue Achaia. Let's all come together this Sunday to achieve even higher rates for New Democracy throughout Greece, and especially here in Achaia. Do you remember when I came here before the May 21 elections and we spoke at this beautiful gathering? We made a bet together to achieve what some people thought was impossible - to make Achaia and the municipality of Patras blue. We succeeded, except for a corner of Achaia, Mr. Regional Governor - if I am not mistaken - by a few hundred votes. Let's make a bet together in these polls next Sunday to increase our percentage even more, so that on June 26th, we can roll up our sleeves and work for a Greece of progress and pride.
