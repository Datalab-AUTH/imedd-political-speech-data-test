So we must go now and complete what we started at the ballot box on May 21. And one more thing: we can raise the bar of our expectations even higher. The 40.7% that we got is impressive. But we can and must do even better because the next election Sunday after that, we need to have a strong, stable self-reliance to be able to implement the big changes that the country so badly needs. I must tell you that, looking at the election results in the second district of Thessaloniki, we are obviously satisfied with our figures. However, it did not escape my attention that various parties and factions to the right of New Democracy have achieved quite high percentages.
