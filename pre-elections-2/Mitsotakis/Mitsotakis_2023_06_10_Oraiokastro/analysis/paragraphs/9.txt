The leader of the Official Opposition said something that I agree with in a speech made by Mr. Tsipras yesterday. He said "we vote for our lives". Yes, we are voting for our lives. We are voting for the lives of young children who, after graduating from a good public university, want to have a decent job. Mr. Rector, we want quality knowledge in universities with libraries, not squatters' rooms and violence, as has been the case at Aristotle University for decades.
