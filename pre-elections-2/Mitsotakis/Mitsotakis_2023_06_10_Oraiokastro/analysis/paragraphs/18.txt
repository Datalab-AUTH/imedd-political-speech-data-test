So, friends, the stakes here are very high. The country needs a stable and strong government in the next day. This stable and strong government can only be a government of New Democracy, and I am sure that with your support, we will be able to put this national goal into practice. I would like to end by saying that I want to make a bet with all of you here, both from Oreokastro and the second region of Thessaloniki, which has traditionally been a strong castle of New Democracy. Here in the 2nd Thessaloniki region, we can increase our percentages even further. We can squeeze - as I said before - parties and factions that have suddenly 'come out of the woodwork', without saying anything at all, relying only on emotion. But this is a job that we will all do together, and above all, you will do it.
