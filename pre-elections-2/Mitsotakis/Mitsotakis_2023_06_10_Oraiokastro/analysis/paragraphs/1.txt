Good day and thank you for this impressive welcome. Thank you for coming here today at noon, so massively, to once again show your support for our great party, New Democracy. Thank you, especially here in Oraiokastro, for giving New Democracy very strong percentages at the ballot box on May 21. Thank you, because you trusted a party that, as the Mayor said, has kept the country standing in the midst of great difficulties for four years, but at the same time honored the "truth agreement" that I asked you to sign in July 2019.
