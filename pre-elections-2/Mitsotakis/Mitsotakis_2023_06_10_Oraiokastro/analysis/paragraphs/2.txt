We are the party that, for the first time in the history of New Democracy, managed to increase its percentages and the absolute number of votes from ballot box to ballot box while in government. I must tell you that this vote of confidence from the Greek citizens is a heavy responsibility for me to live up to the trust and love of the people for a second four-year term. To be able to move even faster, even more boldly, to make the great changes that the country needs. Because at the ballot box on May 21st, the citizens rewarded consistency, hard work, and civilized political discourse, and rejected division, toxicity, and darkness. Unity won, division was defeated, truth won, and lies were defeated.
