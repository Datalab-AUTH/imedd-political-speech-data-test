We can increase our percentages. We will increase our percentages in Thessaloniki, and we will be back here in Oraiokastro to celebrate the great victory of New Democracy for a strong, stable government and to move forward so that we can write our own history. Above all, we are fighting for this generation to write its own history. With a strong New Democracy and a stable government for Greece, we will move forward, only forward and only upwards. Thank you very much for this impressive reception. Let's go and finish the job on June 25th. Be well. Thank you very much.
