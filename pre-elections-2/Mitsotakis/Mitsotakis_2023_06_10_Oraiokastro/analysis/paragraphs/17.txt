So, friends, only New Democracy has a plan and has demonstrated in practice that it knows how to distribute collective wealth fairly and ultimately support our weakest citizens. What have we done during these four years of great difficulty, pandemic, and energy crisis? We have supported society. Today, I walked a little bit here in your market and saw shops full of people. Remember that three years ago, we had to close the whole market because of the coronavirus. We came and supported businesses and workers so that these businesses could stay alive and have a more optimistic future today. We did the same thing with the energy crisis. We supported our electricity bills and society as much as we could with tools like Market Pass. We are happy today to see inflation coming down. It is not yet where we would like it to be, but certainly, the hardest inflation is behind us.
