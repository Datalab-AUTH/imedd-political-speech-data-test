I would like to take this opportunity to address all of our fellow citizens who believe that there are parties - especially small, non-existent parties that we do not know about - that can express religious sentiment in an authentic way. I want to tell them that faith is not imprisoned within the confines of a few small parties. Faith and orthodoxy unite, not divide. "Caesar's to Caesar and God's to God." So let various people who want to glorify themselves by hiding put aside these logics that they supposedly represent the Church and Orthodoxy and that others are less orthodox or less faithful than they are. I do not think that these arguments can stand up today in Greek society in 2023.
