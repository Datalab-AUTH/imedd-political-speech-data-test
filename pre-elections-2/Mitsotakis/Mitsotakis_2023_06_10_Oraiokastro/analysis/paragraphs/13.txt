So that's what we're going to vote on. We will vote, yes, for our future. People need to know that none of what we have achieved can be taken for granted. And very easily, if an unstable government with a weak parliamentary majority emerges the next day, things will be difficult. Just as if no majority emerges at the ballot box, there is virtually no possibility of forming a coalition government. Why? Because the one party that we have worked with in the past, PASOK, is clearly saying to us, "I don't care if you have 149 MPs, I don't care about anything. I do not want to take on the responsibility of governing, I will go to the opposition".
