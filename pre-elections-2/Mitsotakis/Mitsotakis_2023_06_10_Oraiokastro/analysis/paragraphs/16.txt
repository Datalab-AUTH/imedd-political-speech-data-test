In the next four years, we have a clear plan on how we want to further recover the economy, how we want to support the welfare state, but above all, we have a plan, my friends, on how we are going to generate the wealth that is so necessary to be able to have a serious and effective social policy. The only political force that is currently talking in the country about how to produce wealth is New Democracy. Workers will know that they can only have better wages when there are companies that invest and create jobs. There are no workers without businesses. So, if we do not have investment, a lot of investment, if we do not reduce unemployment, workers' wages cannot increase.
