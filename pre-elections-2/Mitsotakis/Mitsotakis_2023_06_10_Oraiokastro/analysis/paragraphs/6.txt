I would also like to address those who talk very easily about patriotism and defending national interests, and ask them to consider which government managed to keep the country's ship stable and make Greece much stronger today than it was in 2019, in the midst of great difficulties. When I came in 2019 and spoke to you again here in Thessaloniki, I told you that one of my three central commitments is a secure and strong Greece. Have we delivered on that commitment? We have invested in our Armed Forces in such a way that we have effectively reversed the balance of power in the Aegean within four years. We have repelled the aggressive appetites of our neighbors - not in words but in deeds - by building strong alliances, supporting our Armed Forces, and making our country the most important factor of geopolitical stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.
