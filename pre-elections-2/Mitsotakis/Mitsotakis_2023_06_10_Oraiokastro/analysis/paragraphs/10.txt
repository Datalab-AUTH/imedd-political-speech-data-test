Yes, we vote for our lives and for better jobs and wages. When I talk, especially to young people entering the labor market, the first thing they tell me - and rightly so - is that wages in our country are still low. It is difficult for a young person, especially if they want to start a family, to make ends meet with the wages that exist today in the private sector. But the answer, ladies and gentlemen, is that wage growth can only come through growth and private investment. Private investment can only come from a government like New Democracy.
