Therefore, friends, there is only one government proposal in the country today: that of New Democracy. That is why New Democracy must be strong and self-reliant after the elections on June 25th. And it is precisely this strong self-reliance, this stable self-reliance - I want to say it here and I always say it with our cadres, who are fighting their own battle - that is in no way a credential for arrogance.
