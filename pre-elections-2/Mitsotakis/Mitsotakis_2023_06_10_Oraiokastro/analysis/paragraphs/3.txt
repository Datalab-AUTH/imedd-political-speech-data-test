This is an important conquest for our country, but it is a conquest that is not yet complete, my friends. It is incomplete because nothing is ever complete. We have new elections on June 25th, and we have these elections for one reason only: because Mr. Tsipras, as we predicted and stated during the election campaign, took steps to undermine the stability of the country by introducing an electoral system that would, with mathematical certainty, lead to ungovernability. If the electoral system that will be in force on May 21st had been in force on June 25th, New Democracy would have had a strong self-reliance, and the country would have had a stable government as of today.
