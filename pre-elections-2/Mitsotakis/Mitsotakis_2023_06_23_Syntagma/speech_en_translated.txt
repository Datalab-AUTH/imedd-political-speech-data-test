Young Democrats, Athenians, ONNEDites, thank you. I wholeheartedly thank you for this welcome and impressive presence. The voice of Athens can be heard thunderously in every corner of our country today. It now remains to resound in the ballot boxes on Sunday, with New Democracy as the big winner. Because, friends, only then will we cut the thread of this two-month electoral marathon with a result that will give the country a stable government, the government of New Democracy. However, this result will also give our party the strength to put its commitments, its plan, our plan for a self-reliant Greece into practice. That is why we ask for the mandate of the Greek people at the polls on Sunday.

Friends, we are back at Syntagma, the place that hosted the first meeting of our party since its founder, Constantine Karamanlis. But also the place where, as a young man, I remember Konstantinos Mitsotakis speaking to hundreds of thousands of Athenians. I really wanted to close this election period here in Syntagma. And your mass participation tonight is not only proof of your strength, but I believe it is also a symbol of a closing circle. The square is no longer divided into up and down. It is once again one, unique, free, and democratic.

As a Member of Parliament for Athens for 20 years, I feel moved and proud. First of all, I feel moved to see so many old friends among us, old fighters of the party with whom we have fought so many battles together. But I am also moved and proud of the electoral journey we have made together so far. It may have been very hard, it may have been agonizing, but once again we have turned difficulties into opportunities.

You, the life of the party, have disseminated our positions to society. A huge "thank you" to all of our members who put my request into action, following the great victory of June 25th, to run for the party. You succeeded. A big "thank you". You demonstrated that New Democracy is the most well-organized party in the country and the largest center-right party in Europe.

I feel today, I can say, that I have done my duty. I have crossed the country again, town by town, village by village, from one corner of Greece to another. It has been an exciting journey, which offers me satisfaction and knowledge each time, and gives me strength and responsibility.

But be careful, we are in the final stretch. We are also in the final effort. Until the day after tomorrow at 7:00 PM, we have our enthusiasm as an ally. We have enthusiasm as an ally, but we also have an enemy: complacency. So first, we go to the polls, and then we continue with our day so that no vote is lost without a vote.

I have spoken many times about the inexorable arithmetic of the ballot box. Beware! A small and careless inaction on our part, resulting in more parties in Parliament, can bring many traps to the surface. Just consider this: a few fewer votes in each constituency of the territory are enough to jeopardize the emergence of a strong government. But that is what we will prevent together. So, just as in May, armed with simple logic, we cancelled simple proportional representation. Now, political responsibility must and will lead to national stability. With the mature choice of every Greek woman and every Greek man who seeks security and prosperity for themselves, their families, and their children above all else.

We know, of course, that the expectation bar is high. How many people would have bet before the last election that New Democracy would increase its share of the vote and exceed 40%? But we achieved it, thanks to you. So the bar is high, but I ask all of you, citizens of Athens, to make a bet and surpass it. To achieve even better rates here in the basin. I am sure that the capital city knows how to live up to its title, repeating the triumph we achieved in the first electoral district of Athens, setting a record again in terms of percentages.

Allow me to make a special reference here to my own constituency. We made West Athens blue for the first time, as we had committed to pursue, bringing the double blue predominance to Piraeus and the islands. After all, all of Greece is blue and will remain blue after Sunday's ballot box. Greece is blue and will remain blue because blue is the color of our flag, the sky, the sea, and Greece. This impressive result is proof that this open, progressive party now represents all social strata and all ages in a new reality.

Where are all those people who told us that New Democracy is behind the new generation? I thank the young people who put New Democracy first in these age groups. And why is that? Because young people know very well that in the end, it is quality public education and training that lead to a better profession. The unemployed are well aware that only investment opens up new jobs. Wage earners and pensioners know that ultimately, collective development brings increases. Remember, for the first time, we have increased pensions, and pensions will continue to increase as long as the economy grows. Professionals, entrepreneurs - especially small and medium-sized entrepreneurs - now know that fewer taxes can mean more revenue. Our farmers understand that only by modernizing their production, working together, and introducing technology can they ultimately increase their income.

It is no coincidence, therefore, that the whole country is now dressed in blue, in the colors of New Democracy, in the colors of the homeland. This reveals not only the deeply popular and deeply social character of our party, but also the main demand of the citizens: a safe course without lies, without divisions, and without experimentation. The citizens have turned their backs on "black," toxicity, and division, and have rewarded programmatic discourse, hard work, political decency, and, above all, results. They rewarded a government consistent in words and deeds, and they rewarded a government honest about its failures. Because mistakes are only addressed when they are identified.

I will say it again: on May 21st, we voted and won together. On June 25th, we will vote to govern together, all united. On May 21st, the Greek people rewarded us for an economic policy that reduced 50 taxes, increased income and pensions, and created 300,000 new jobs. Today, we are planning higher wages for all, better public education, and a friendlier, more efficient state.

In other words, what are the citizens asking for? All of these achievements must be consolidated and continued. This is what citizens in every corner of the country are asking for. In a united society that has often shown it can move faster than political parties, with voters who are not confined to outdated ideological boundaries, who overcome artificial differences that some people want to create without party blinders or walls. By turning their backs on slogans, friends, they seek only one thing: tangible results, which they already recognize in New Democracy after four years of experience.

Friends, Young Democrats of Attica, you know well how many crises we have overcome together, from the migratory invasions in Evros and the almost three-year-long pandemic, to the energy shortage and the ongoing national challenges.

You are well aware of our government's brave support in keeping the economy and society afloat, while also implementing all of our commitments: annually relieving citizens of 7 billion in taxes, increasing pensions, increasing disposable income, and of course, strengthening our national defense like never before. None of this could have been achieved without the unbreakable bond of trust we have built, the consistency between our words and actions. This trust has finally translated into trust between citizens and the state. It is a trust that also surrounds our program, the program of our second term in office, and the four major objectives we have set.

The first objective, non-negotiable for me personally, is the best wages for every Greek woman and man. Just as I committed in 2019 to cutting taxes and followed through, I am now committed to raising wages and achieving this goal. The average salary will reach 1,500 euros and the basic salary will reach 950 euros. This will result from national growth, the many investments being made throughout the country, and the constantly falling unemployment rate. By the beginning of 2024, we will also have a new public sector pay scale that will mainly strengthen family allowances. New Democracy is the party that supports the family, especially working mothers, and has a plan to address the issue of under-birth. Annual increases in pensions will continue, as will tax cuts. The tax-free allowance for families with children is being increased by 1,000 euros, and social security contributions will continue to decrease. Additionally, as tax compliance improves, the last of the memorandum taxes, the business tax, will be phased out.

The second major goal, and I would say a personal commitment for me, is to provide good quality public healthcare that is free of charge. We will upgrade emergency departments in 80 hospitals and reduce waiting times. It is unacceptable for citizens to have to wait months for regular operations. We will recruit an additional 10,000 nurses and doctors to the National Health Service, with 1,000 of them being in the EHIC, which will now be supported by personnel from the Armed Forces and the Fire Brigade. We will also establish six helicopter bases for air ambulance services, ensuring rapid response times for citizens in both urban and remote areas. Additionally, we will continue to offer free screening tests for all basic diseases, with a particular focus on women's health, including breast cancer screenings, which have already saved thousands of lives.

Third objective: an efficient, fair, and socially sensitive state. It was us, friends, who were there for the most vulnerable during the four years. We strengthened the minimum guaranteed income. We are making the institution of the Personal Assistant a reality for our fellow citizens with disabilities; 2,000 of them will now have this important support. Of course, we need a more efficient and just state that overcomes the pathologies of the past, those that have hurt us all. You will give us the power to drastically change this state. Everyone will be evaluated, and those who achieve their goals will be rewarded.

And of course, we will continue and complete the great revolution of the digital state, gov.gr, which has now well and truly entered our lives. Few of us remember what our lives were like before gov.gr. At the end of four years, the entire Greek public sector will be digital. Digital technology will make its presence felt in all branches of politics, whether we're talking about education with interactive whiteboards or health, using telemedicine to support our fellow citizens on remote islands. But be careful, we do not just want electronic transactions, we also want professional, human behavior from our civil servants.

And the fourth objective is a strong Greece. What does this mean? Despite any discomfort it may cause, the fence on Evros will be completed and Greece will continue to guard its borders. It will implement a strict but fair migration policy, which has yielded measurable results. At the same time, our coastguard will always come to the aid of every persecuted person whose life is in danger, as it has consistently done for the past four years. Of course, this may also cause discomfort, but I have news for those individuals: the country's arms programs will continue and be completed. Within this year, we will receive the remaining Rafale aircraft, which will shift the balance in the air. Starting in 2025, we will begin receiving the new Belharra frigates, which are already being constructed in French shipyards. And from 2028, the ultra-modern F-35s will join our Air Force.

And of course, at the same time, we will continue with international initiatives, promoting our country as an irreplaceable pole of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, making major energy investments, and transitioning to green energy so that we can access very cheap energy from the sun and wind. All of this will finally make Greece's voice heard with confidence everywhere, from the US Congress to Brussels. And one day, the patriots of words will be distinguished from the true patriots of action.

The whole of Greece, as you well know, is already being turned into one big construction site. The same is happening here in Attica. The Metro has reached Piraeus and is now spreading to the east. Line 4, the largest public project in the country, has already begun construction. Together with the upgrading of the Suburban Railway and the addition of 2,000 new buses, the lives of Athenians will be improved. We will place great emphasis on public transport and the means of public transport because this is what our social sensitivity and the popular character of our party require. You can see the major investments being made everywhere in Athens, how well our tourism is doing, and the major redevelopments in Elliniko, which are being put into practice. Votanikos will also host the new Panathinaikos stadium, which is another commitment that we have kept.

Our opponents are the problems, not the other parties. I have not spoken and will not speak about Syriza, which belongs to a past that Greeks have turned their backs on. There is no need for disapproval. The citizens sent the loudest message of toxicity and populism to Syriza at the ballot box on May 21st and will do so again tomorrow. However, the basic message I want to convey at the end of our election period is this: in uncertain times, the country needs steady leadership. It needs a government that does not rely on fragile majorities, pressures, or balances.

Personally, the greater the citizens' trust, the heavier my personal responsibility feels. I also stated in Thessaloniki two days ago that extreme voices entering Parliament do not necessarily bring pluralism; they may cause a "democratic cacophony." I repeat this here in the capital, which has never reduced loyalty to a party symbol but was the first to remove the symbol of Nazism from the Acropolis. Athens' history itself responds to the new political merchants of religion and homeland. So I say it again: enough with the demek believers and demek patriots.

Friends, Athenians, on Sunday, Greeks have a great opportunity to unite again in a wide river of stability and progress. A great river in which there is a place for all those who, regardless of party affiliations, seek truth, a plan, and first and foremost, results. There is a place for all those who believe in responsible patriotism and creative modernization. They have a place in a party that is open in thought and bold in action, our New Democracy, because it is the only party capable of taking and running with the baton of the future. In a few hours from now, the lights of this double election period will go out, and the responsibility now passes into your hands. That's why the weight of every vote becomes heavier. The day after tomorrow, inside the envelope, there will not be a blank check; there will be a strong mandate, a passport to progress, with a popular stamp.

That is why I invite you to create an electoral "heat wave" for one day, to reach 40% and more in our percentages. So that the helm of the country can safely lead it to where we all want it to be: at the heart and forefront of Europe. From here, the city that gave birth to democracy, we are sending a message of victory today. And until the polls open, we must spread it everywhere, to every neighborhood, to every home in Attica, but also throughout the entire country, from Ormenio to Gavdos, from the Othonians to Kastelorizo, to a country where blue will be the certainty of hope and for four years will be the rainbow of our collective optimism.

It is the greatest honor for me to be the Prime Minister of the country. I ask for the strength to continue this work. With my feet on the ground and my eyes on the sky, let us go forward with our eyes and values high, our hearts wide open, our arms wide open, united and strong as ever. On June 25th, we will decide and vote, and on June 26th, we will roll up our sleeves and continue to boldly and steadily build the new Greece, only moving forward. Your love and trust in me will be our compasses on this new and exciting journey. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love, trust, and support for New Democracy. Let us write our own history together. Thank you.
