Third objective: an efficient, fair, and socially sensitive state. It was us, friends, who were there for the most vulnerable during the four years. We strengthened the minimum guaranteed income. We are making the institution of the Personal Assistant a reality for our fellow citizens with disabilities; 2,000 of them will now have this important support. Of course, we need a more efficient and just state that overcomes the pathologies of the past, those that have hurt us all. You will give us the power to drastically change this state. Everyone will be evaluated, and those who achieve their goals will be rewarded.
