I have spoken many times about the inexorable arithmetic of the ballot box. Beware! A small and careless inaction on our part, resulting in more parties in Parliament, can bring many traps to the surface. Just consider this: a few fewer votes in each constituency of the territory are enough to jeopardize the emergence of a strong government. But that is what we will prevent together. So, just as in May, armed with simple logic, we cancelled simple proportional representation. Now, political responsibility must and will lead to national stability. With the mature choice of every Greek woman and every Greek man who seeks security and prosperity for themselves, their families, and their children above all else.
