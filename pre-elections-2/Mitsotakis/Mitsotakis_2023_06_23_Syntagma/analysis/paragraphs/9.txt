Allow me to make a special reference here to my own constituency. We made West Athens blue for the first time, as we had committed to pursue, bringing the double blue predominance to Piraeus and the islands. After all, all of Greece is blue and will remain blue after Sunday's ballot box. Greece is blue and will remain blue because blue is the color of our flag, the sky, the sea, and Greece. This impressive result is proof that this open, progressive party now represents all social strata and all ages in a new reality.
