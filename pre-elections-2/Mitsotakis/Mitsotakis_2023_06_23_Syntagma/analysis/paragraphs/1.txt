Young Democrats, Athenians, ONNEDites, thank you. I wholeheartedly thank you for this welcome and impressive presence. The voice of Athens can be heard thunderously in every corner of our country today. It now remains to resound in the ballot boxes on Sunday, with New Democracy as the big winner. Because, friends, only then will we cut the thread of this two-month electoral marathon with a result that will give the country a stable government, the government of New Democracy. However, this result will also give our party the strength to put its commitments, its plan, our plan for a self-reliant Greece into practice. That is why we ask for the mandate of the Greek people at the polls on Sunday.
