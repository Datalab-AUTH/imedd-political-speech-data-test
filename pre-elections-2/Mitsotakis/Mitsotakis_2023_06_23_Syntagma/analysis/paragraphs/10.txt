Where are all those people who told us that New Democracy is behind the new generation? I thank the young people who put New Democracy first in these age groups. And why is that? Because young people know very well that in the end, it is quality public education and training that lead to a better profession. The unemployed are well aware that only investment opens up new jobs. Wage earners and pensioners know that ultimately, collective development brings increases. Remember, for the first time, we have increased pensions, and pensions will continue to increase as long as the economy grows. Professionals, entrepreneurs - especially small and medium-sized entrepreneurs - now know that fewer taxes can mean more revenue. Our farmers understand that only by modernizing their production, working together, and introducing technology can they ultimately increase their income.
