And the fourth objective is a strong Greece. What does this mean? Despite any discomfort it may cause, the fence on Evros will be completed and Greece will continue to guard its borders. It will implement a strict but fair migration policy, which has yielded measurable results. At the same time, our coastguard will always come to the aid of every persecuted person whose life is in danger, as it has consistently done for the past four years. Of course, this may also cause discomfort, but I have news for those individuals: the country's arms programs will continue and be completed. Within this year, we will receive the remaining Rafale aircraft, which will shift the balance in the air. Starting in 2025, we will begin receiving the new Belharra frigates, which are already being constructed in French shipyards. And from 2028, the ultra-modern F-35s will join our Air Force.
