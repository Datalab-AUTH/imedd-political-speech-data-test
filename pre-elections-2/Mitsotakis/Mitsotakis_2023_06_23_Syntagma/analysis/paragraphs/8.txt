We know, of course, that the expectation bar is high. How many people would have bet before the last election that New Democracy would increase its share of the vote and exceed 40%? But we achieved it, thanks to you. So the bar is high, but I ask all of you, citizens of Athens, to make a bet and surpass it. To achieve even better rates here in the basin. I am sure that the capital city knows how to live up to its title, repeating the triumph we achieved in the first electoral district of Athens, setting a record again in terms of percentages.
