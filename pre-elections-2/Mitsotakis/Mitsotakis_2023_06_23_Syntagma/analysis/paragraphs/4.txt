You, the life of the party, have disseminated our positions to society. A huge "thank you" to all of our members who put my request into action, following the great victory of June 25th, to run for the party. You succeeded. A big "thank you". You demonstrated that New Democracy is the most well-organized party in the country and the largest center-right party in Europe.
