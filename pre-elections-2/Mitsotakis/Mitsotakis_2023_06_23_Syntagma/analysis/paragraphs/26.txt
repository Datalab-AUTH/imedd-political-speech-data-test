That is why I invite you to create an electoral "heat wave" for one day, to reach 40% and more in our percentages. So that the helm of the country can safely lead it to where we all want it to be: at the heart and forefront of Europe. From here, the city that gave birth to democracy, we are sending a message of victory today. And until the polls open, we must spread it everywhere, to every neighborhood, to every home in Attica, but also throughout the entire country, from Ormenio to Gavdos, from the Othonians to Kastelorizo, to a country where blue will be the certainty of hope and for four years will be the rainbow of our collective optimism.
