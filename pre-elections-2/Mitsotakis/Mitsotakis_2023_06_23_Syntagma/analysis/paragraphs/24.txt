Personally, the greater the citizens' trust, the heavier my personal responsibility feels. I also stated in Thessaloniki two days ago that extreme voices entering Parliament do not necessarily bring pluralism; they may cause a "democratic cacophony." I repeat this here in the capital, which has never reduced loyalty to a party symbol but was the first to remove the symbol of Nazism from the Acropolis. Athens' history itself responds to the new political merchants of religion and homeland. So I say it again: enough with the demek believers and demek patriots.
