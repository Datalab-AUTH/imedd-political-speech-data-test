I will say it again: on May 21st, we voted and won together. On June 25th, we will vote to govern together, all united. On May 21st, the Greek people rewarded us for an economic policy that reduced 50 taxes, increased income and pensions, and created 300,000 new jobs. Today, we are planning higher wages for all, better public education, and a friendlier, more efficient state.
