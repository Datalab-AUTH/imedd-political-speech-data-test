As a Member of Parliament for Athens for 20 years, I feel moved and proud. First of all, I feel moved to see so many old friends among us, old fighters of the party with whom we have fought so many battles together. But I am also moved and proud of the electoral journey we have made together so far. It may have been very hard, it may have been agonizing, but once again we have turned difficulties into opportunities.
