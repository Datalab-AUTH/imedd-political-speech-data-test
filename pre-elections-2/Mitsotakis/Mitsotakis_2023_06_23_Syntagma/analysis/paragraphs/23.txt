Our opponents are the problems, not the other parties. I have not spoken and will not speak about Syriza, which belongs to a past that Greeks have turned their backs on. There is no need for disapproval. The citizens sent the loudest message of toxicity and populism to Syriza at the ballot box on May 21st and will do so again tomorrow. However, the basic message I want to convey at the end of our election period is this: in uncertain times, the country needs steady leadership. It needs a government that does not rely on fragile majorities, pressures, or balances.
