The second major goal, and I would say a personal commitment for me, is to provide good quality public healthcare that is free of charge. We will upgrade emergency departments in 80 hospitals and reduce waiting times. It is unacceptable for citizens to have to wait months for regular operations. We will recruit an additional 10,000 nurses and doctors to the National Health Service, with 1,000 of them being in the EHIC, which will now be supported by personnel from the Armed Forces and the Fire Brigade. We will also establish six helicopter bases for air ambulance services, ensuring rapid response times for citizens in both urban and remote areas. Additionally, we will continue to offer free screening tests for all basic diseases, with a particular focus on women's health, including breast cancer screenings, which have already saved thousands of lives.
