It is the greatest honor for me to be the Prime Minister of the country. I ask for the strength to continue this work. With my feet on the ground and my eyes on the sky, let us go forward with our eyes and values high, our hearts wide open, our arms wide open, united and strong as ever. On June 25th, we will decide and vote, and on June 26th, we will roll up our sleeves and continue to boldly and steadily build the new Greece, only moving forward. Your love and trust in me will be our compasses on this new and exciting journey. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love, trust, and support for New Democracy. Let us write our own history together. Thank you.
