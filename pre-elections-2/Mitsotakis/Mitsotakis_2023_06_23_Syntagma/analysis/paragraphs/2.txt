Friends, we are back at Syntagma, the place that hosted the first meeting of our party since its founder, Constantine Karamanlis. But also the place where, as a young man, I remember Konstantinos Mitsotakis speaking to hundreds of thousands of Athenians. I really wanted to close this election period here in Syntagma. And your mass participation tonight is not only proof of your strength, but I believe it is also a symbol of a closing circle. The square is no longer divided into up and down. It is once again one, unique, free, and democratic.
