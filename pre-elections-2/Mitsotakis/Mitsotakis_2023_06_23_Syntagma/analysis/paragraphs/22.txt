The whole of Greece, as you well know, is already being turned into one big construction site. The same is happening here in Attica. The Metro has reached Piraeus and is now spreading to the east. Line 4, the largest public project in the country, has already begun construction. Together with the upgrading of the Suburban Railway and the addition of 2,000 new buses, the lives of Athenians will be improved. We will place great emphasis on public transport and the means of public transport because this is what our social sensitivity and the popular character of our party require. You can see the major investments being made everywhere in Athens, how well our tourism is doing, and the major redevelopments in Elliniko, which are being put into practice. Votanikos will also host the new Panathinaikos stadium, which is another commitment that we have kept.
