The first objective, non-negotiable for me personally, is the best wages for every Greek woman and man. Just as I committed in 2019 to cutting taxes and followed through, I am now committed to raising wages and achieving this goal. The average salary will reach 1,500 euros and the basic salary will reach 950 euros. This will result from national growth, the many investments being made throughout the country, and the constantly falling unemployment rate. By the beginning of 2024, we will also have a new public sector pay scale that will mainly strengthen family allowances. New Democracy is the party that supports the family, especially working mothers, and has a plan to address the issue of under-birth. Annual increases in pensions will continue, as will tax cuts. The tax-free allowance for families with children is being increased by 1,000 euros, and social security contributions will continue to decrease. Additionally, as tax compliance improves, the last of the memorandum taxes, the business tax, will be phased out.
