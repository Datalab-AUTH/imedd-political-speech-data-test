Friends, Athenians, on Sunday, Greeks have a great opportunity to unite again in a wide river of stability and progress. A great river in which there is a place for all those who, regardless of party affiliations, seek truth, a plan, and first and foremost, results. There is a place for all those who believe in responsible patriotism and creative modernization. They have a place in a party that is open in thought and bold in action, our New Democracy, because it is the only party capable of taking and running with the baton of the future. In a few hours from now, the lights of this double election period will go out, and the responsibility now passes into your hands. That's why the weight of every vote becomes heavier. The day after tomorrow, inside the envelope, there will not be a blank check; there will be a strong mandate, a passport to progress, with a popular stamp.
