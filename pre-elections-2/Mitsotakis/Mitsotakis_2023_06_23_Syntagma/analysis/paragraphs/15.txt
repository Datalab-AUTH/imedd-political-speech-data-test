You are well aware of our government's brave support in keeping the economy and society afloat, while also implementing all of our commitments: annually relieving citizens of 7 billion in taxes, increasing pensions, increasing disposable income, and of course, strengthening our national defense like never before. None of this could have been achieved without the unbreakable bond of trust we have built, the consistency between our words and actions. This trust has finally translated into trust between citizens and the state. It is a trust that also surrounds our program, the program of our second term in office, and the four major objectives we have set.
