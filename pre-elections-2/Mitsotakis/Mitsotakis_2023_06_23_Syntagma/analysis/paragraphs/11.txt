It is no coincidence, therefore, that the whole country is now dressed in blue, in the colors of New Democracy, in the colors of the homeland. This reveals not only the deeply popular and deeply social character of our party, but also the main demand of the citizens: a safe course without lies, without divisions, and without experimentation. The citizens have turned their backs on "black," toxicity, and division, and have rewarded programmatic discourse, hard work, political decency, and, above all, results. They rewarded a government consistent in words and deeds, and they rewarded a government honest about its failures. Because mistakes are only addressed when they are identified.
