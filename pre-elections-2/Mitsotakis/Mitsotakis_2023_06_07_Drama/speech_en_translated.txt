Thank you for the warm welcome. We proudly raise the flags of New Democracy and our country, and together on June 25th, we will achieve another great victory for a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. Friends, I was unable to come to Drama during the previous election period, but your presence here today more than compensates me. I thank you for your love and trust. First and foremost, I thank you for the support you have given to our great party, New Democracy. We achieved a great victory in the last elections, and we will now complete it. Today, if the country had not faced the "landmine" of proportional representation, we would already have had a strong and stable government with a comfortable parliamentary majority. The Greek people sent a thunderous message in the elections of May 21st. This was an accurate message before the elections of May 21st. I am not Prime Minister now, but I will be Prime Minister again with your support and vote on June 26th.

In the last elections, my friends, the citizens rewarded the great effort that our party has made for four years. As I was coming here to speak to you, a friend told me a phrase, three words that I think say it all about what we have achieved in these four years: 'we have settled Greece'. This was a great collective effort that extended to many policy areas, including the economy, social policy, foreign policy, defence, and security.

It was New Democracy that allowed the country to stand up again. We were the ones who put our commitment into practice and secured our borders. Greece is no longer a closed vineyard. Greece has fortified its borders at sea and on land, strengthened its Armed Forces, and its voice, the voice of our country, is now loud from Brussels to the US Congress. Today, Greece has every right to look to the future with optimism.

But we are all here because we know very well that our mission is not yet complete. We have to validate the message and the verdict of the Greek people at the ballot box on June 25th, so that the country will have a stable government with a comfortable majority the next day. Here in Drama, we have done very well, but we can do even better. And this is what I would like to ask of you: to join forces, to seek out those of our fellow citizens here in Drama who may have turned their eyes and ultimately their votes to other parties, possibly some smaller parties that are positioned to the right of New Democracy, and to say a very simple word to them: patriotism in words is easy, but patriotism in responsibility and action is measured in results.

And, of course, for those who seek to "imprison" the Orthodox faith within the confines of some small parties, we answer that Orthodoxy and our faith are much greater and have always been a force for unity, not for division of the Greek people. And let us leave the Church out of politics.

Friends, here in Drama, it is very important to send this message: the constant effort for a better Greece, a more advanced Greece, with better wages and a stronger economy, must continue today. That is why the ballot box on June 25th is so crucial. You know very well that if more parties enter the Parliament, the bar of self-reliance is raised. What the country needs today is a stable and strong government with a comfortable governing majority so that we can implement our programme of bold changes for the next four years.

Give me the strength. Trust me to make this plan for a better Greece a reality. And trust us, because we are the ones who have been showing the way for four years now. Not only in how we have dealt with the multiple crises that have befallen us, but also in how we have revived the economy and put it on a path of sustainable growth.

There has been a big debate lately about taxes. The opposition, both major and minor, is slowly revealing their hidden agenda of how they plan to raise taxes on the middle class again. We counter this approach with what we have already achieved over the past four years. In 2019, I came back and talked to you and said, "One commitment to keep, we'll make it happen." And we did. We reduced taxes for all Greeks.

ENFIA has decreased. The import tax rate has decreased. Agricultural schemes that cooperate are taxed at 10%. The tax on dividends has decreased to 5%. The solidarity levy has been abolished. These are all tangible tax reductions that this government has implemented. This government also understood that in order to discuss how to distribute surplus growth, we must first have growth. First, the pie must grow, and then we can discuss how to share it.

So, friends, we have grown the national economy's pie, and we continue to do so through investment, extroversion, and business initiatives that create good jobs. In particular, Drama has several high-tech companies that are creating jobs and investing in the area. I recently reviewed the proposals submitted for the development law and the new investment projects in Drama, and I wondered if these entrepreneurs would be as willing to invest in the future as those who will create the jobs of the future. Unfortunately, the answer is no. This government has successfully created an investment boom, and only through investment can we achieve better jobs and wages.

We know how to raise the average wage to 1,500 euros. And we can commit ourselves to this because this is the policy we have served, and this is the policy we will continue to serve. We know that we can raise the minimum wage to 950 euros because we simply took it over at 650 euros, and we have already raised it to 780 euros. We know that in difficult times, this party, the great popular party of social New Democracy, must stand by our fellow citizens, especially those who are being tested.

Today, here in the pedestrian street of Drama, the shops are open. The small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, despite the difficulties, are looking to the future with more optimism. And this is because, friends, we kept the economy alive and supported society during the difficult years of the coronavirus. We did not hesitate to spend a lot of resources to keep society upright. But all of this has one necessary condition: that the economy can grow, GDP can grow, and then a responsible government can distribute it fairly. We can make all of this happen.

Just as we can implement a number of chronic pending issues specific to your region, Drama. Do you remember when I came here before the elections? The first issue you raised with me, and rightly so, was the isolation of Drama and the impossibility of connecting it to the Egnatia highway. Today, both of the central commitments I gave you are being implemented. I visited the first construction site, near Kavala, of the new Kavala-Drama road link, which is already being implemented. By the end of the year, we will have a final contractor for the major project to link Drama with Amphipolis, which is our central election commitment and will be implemented by this government and will be ready before the end of the next four years.

I want to pay the same attention to supporting the local economy of Drama. You have many comparative advantages here. Not only do you have an industrial region that attracts excellent businesses, but you also have an extremely dynamic marble sector and amazing businesses that make some of the best wines in our country. We want to support precisely this primary sector.

Support mountain tourism. Some may remember that in the past, foreigners came to see Falacro with the intention of creating a top ski resort. At that time, we rejected their investment and they went to Bansko, Bulgaria. However, things are changing with our government, and Drama has the potential to become a center of culture. With resources from the Recovery Fund, the "Andrikakis" camp will be transformed into a hub of culture and new technologies. Drama has the potential to lead in many development sectors, and we want to make this vision a reality not only for Drama but for the entire Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

But, in order to achieve all this, there is, friends, one necessary condition. I repeat it: on the evening of 25 June, the map of our country will be blue again and New Democracy will have a strong mandate from the citizens to govern, a strong mandate that will also be a reward for all the work we have done in the past four years. But it will not be a blank mandate; it will be a personal contract of trust and credibility, which we will sign with every Greek.For the next four years, we know that the higher the percentage we get, the greater the responsibility that the citizens place on our shoulders, and the more courageous we must be and the more determined we must be to move forward with the great changes that the country so desperately needs. And these changes - you can be absolutely sure and confident - we are now much more ready, much more experienced, much more prepared to implement them.

Take, for example, the changes we need to make to the National Health System. I have never hidden that this is a big challenge for me. We have a four-year period to create a modern, new National Health System for our country. It is my personal commitment, and we will make it a reality. We will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors, many of whom are already serving as auxiliaries in the National Health System. We will support our hospitals - you know that we have ambitious plans for the hospital in Drama, not only for its energy upgrade, but also for securing resources for the emergency departments and the intensive care unit. We want every Greek, regardless of their location, to have access to quality health services, whether they are in a large city or a village, with support for health centers, more telemedicine, and more health personnel. This is a big personal challenge for me - we have learned the lessons of the pandemic, and we now know the strengths and weaknesses of the National Health System. The next four years will be dedicated to the great overhaul of the NHS. Believe me, because you know that I have a 'bad' habit of implementing the commitments I make to you.

So, friends, we have many ambitious plans for the next four years. However, I insist on the need to have a stable and strong majority precisely because this strong majority will enable us to make significant changes. I imagine that our political opponents would be very pleased if New Democracy in the next Parliament had a slim parliamentary majority, with only 151, 152, or 153 MPs. We will not indulge them. We will have a strong parliamentary majority, with a percentage in the elections that exceeds the percentage that we received in the ballot box on May 21st. This, I repeat, is the necessary condition for us to move forward together on the bold changes that we have promised to the Greek people.

We did not hide our program. We presented it in great detail from the first ballot. We have talked about a Greece of growth, social cohesion, justice, and a strong Greece that invests in its Armed Forces and guards its borders. We have no hidden surprises or agendas to raise taxes. Taxes will only be reduced under New Democracy, as they have been for the past four years. We will go to the ballot box knowing that only New Democracy has a substantially convincing proposal for governance. The opposition is only interested in competing for primacy in the center-left. We are only voting for a government, not for an opposition, and the government that emerges in the next elections will have a heavy task: to continue to lead the country along this path of development.

I am sure there will be a New Democracy government. I leave Drama more convinced that this blue wave, which swelled in the ballot box on May 21, is becoming even stronger. And from here in Drama, in Eastern Macedonia, you are sending a message of a great victory for our party in the next elections. So let us go together boldly, steadily, forward, to achieve the great victory so that we can continue and complete the work we started four years ago. Thank you for your trust, thank you for your applause. Together we are going only forward, only higher, bolder, stronger. Be well, thank you very much, and goodbye.
