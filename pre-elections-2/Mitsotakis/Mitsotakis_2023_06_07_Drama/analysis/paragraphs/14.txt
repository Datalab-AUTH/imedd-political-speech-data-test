I want to pay the same attention to supporting the local economy of Drama. You have many comparative advantages here. Not only do you have an industrial region that attracts excellent businesses, but you also have an extremely dynamic marble sector and amazing businesses that make some of the best wines in our country. We want to support precisely this primary sector.
