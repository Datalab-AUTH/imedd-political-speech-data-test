Give me the strength. Trust me to make this plan for a better Greece a reality. And trust us, because we are the ones who have been showing the way for four years now. Not only in how we have dealt with the multiple crises that have befallen us, but also in how we have revived the economy and put it on a path of sustainable growth.
