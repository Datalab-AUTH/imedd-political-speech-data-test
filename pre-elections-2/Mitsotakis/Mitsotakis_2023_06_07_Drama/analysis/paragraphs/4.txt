But we are all here because we know very well that our mission is not yet complete. We have to validate the message and the verdict of the Greek people at the ballot box on June 25th, so that the country will have a stable government with a comfortable majority the next day. Here in Drama, we have done very well, but we can do even better. And this is what I would like to ask of you: to join forces, to seek out those of our fellow citizens here in Drama who may have turned their eyes and ultimately their votes to other parties, possibly some smaller parties that are positioned to the right of New Democracy, and to say a very simple word to them: patriotism in words is easy, but patriotism in responsibility and action is measured in results.
