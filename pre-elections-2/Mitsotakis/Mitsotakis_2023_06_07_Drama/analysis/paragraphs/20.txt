I am sure there will be a New Democracy government. I leave Drama more convinced that this blue wave, which swelled in the ballot box on May 21, is becoming even stronger. And from here in Drama, in Eastern Macedonia, you are sending a message of a great victory for our party in the next elections. So let us go together boldly, steadily, forward, to achieve the great victory so that we can continue and complete the work we started four years ago. Thank you for your trust, thank you for your applause. Together we are going only forward, only higher, bolder, stronger. Be well, thank you very much, and goodbye.
