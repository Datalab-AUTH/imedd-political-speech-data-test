Support mountain tourism. Some may remember that in the past, foreigners came to see Falacro with the intention of creating a top ski resort. At that time, we rejected their investment and they went to Bansko, Bulgaria. However, things are changing with our government, and Drama has the potential to become a center of culture. With resources from the Recovery Fund, the "Andrikakis" camp will be transformed into a hub of culture and new technologies. Drama has the potential to lead in many development sectors, and we want to make this vision a reality not only for Drama but for the entire Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.
