It was New Democracy that allowed the country to stand up again. We were the ones who put our commitment into practice and secured our borders. Greece is no longer a closed vineyard. Greece has fortified its borders at sea and on land, strengthened its Armed Forces, and its voice, the voice of our country, is now loud from Brussels to the US Congress. Today, Greece has every right to look to the future with optimism.
