We know how to raise the average wage to 1,500 euros. And we can commit ourselves to this because this is the policy we have served, and this is the policy we will continue to serve. We know that we can raise the minimum wage to 950 euros because we simply took it over at 650 euros, and we have already raised it to 780 euros. We know that in difficult times, this party, the great popular party of social New Democracy, must stand by our fellow citizens, especially those who are being tested.
