Just as we can implement a number of chronic pending issues specific to your region, Drama. Do you remember when I came here before the elections? The first issue you raised with me, and rightly so, was the isolation of Drama and the impossibility of connecting it to the Egnatia highway. Today, both of the central commitments I gave you are being implemented. I visited the first construction site, near Kavala, of the new Kavala-Drama road link, which is already being implemented. By the end of the year, we will have a final contractor for the major project to link Drama with Amphipolis, which is our central election commitment and will be implemented by this government and will be ready before the end of the next four years.
