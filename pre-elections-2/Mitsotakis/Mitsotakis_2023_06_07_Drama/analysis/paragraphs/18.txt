So, friends, we have many ambitious plans for the next four years. However, I insist on the need to have a stable and strong majority precisely because this strong majority will enable us to make significant changes. I imagine that our political opponents would be very pleased if New Democracy in the next Parliament had a slim parliamentary majority, with only 151, 152, or 153 MPs. We will not indulge them. We will have a strong parliamentary majority, with a percentage in the elections that exceeds the percentage that we received in the ballot box on May 21st. This, I repeat, is the necessary condition for us to move forward together on the bold changes that we have promised to the Greek people.
