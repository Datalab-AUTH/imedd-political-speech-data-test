But, in order to achieve all this, there is, friends, one necessary condition. I repeat it: on the evening of 25 June, the map of our country will be blue again and New Democracy will have a strong mandate from the citizens to govern, a strong mandate that will also be a reward for all the work we have done in the past four years. But it will not be a blank mandate; it will be a personal contract of trust and credibility, which we will sign with every Greek.For the next four years, we know that the higher the percentage we get, the greater the responsibility that the citizens place on our shoulders, and the more courageous we must be and the more determined we must be to move forward with the great changes that the country so desperately needs. And these changes - you can be absolutely sure and confident - we are now much more ready, much more experienced, much more prepared to implement them.
