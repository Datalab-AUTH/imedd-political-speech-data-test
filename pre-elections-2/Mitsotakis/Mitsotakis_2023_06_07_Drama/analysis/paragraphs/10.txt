So, friends, we have grown the national economy's pie, and we continue to do so through investment, extroversion, and business initiatives that create good jobs. In particular, Drama has several high-tech companies that are creating jobs and investing in the area. I recently reviewed the proposals submitted for the development law and the new investment projects in Drama, and I wondered if these entrepreneurs would be as willing to invest in the future as those who will create the jobs of the future. Unfortunately, the answer is no. This government has successfully created an investment boom, and only through investment can we achieve better jobs and wages.
