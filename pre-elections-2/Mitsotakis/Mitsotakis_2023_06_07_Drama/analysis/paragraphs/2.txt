In the last elections, my friends, the citizens rewarded the great effort that our party has made for four years. As I was coming here to speak to you, a friend told me a phrase, three words that I think say it all about what we have achieved in these four years: 'we have settled Greece'. This was a great collective effort that extended to many policy areas, including the economy, social policy, foreign policy, defence, and security.
