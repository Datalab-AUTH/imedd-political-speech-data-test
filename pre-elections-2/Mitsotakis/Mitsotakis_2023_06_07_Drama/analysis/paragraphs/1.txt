Thank you for the warm welcome. We proudly raise the flags of New Democracy and our country, and together on June 25th, we will achieve another great victory for a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. Friends, I was unable to come to Drama during the previous election period, but your presence here today more than compensates me. I thank you for your love and trust. First and foremost, I thank you for the support you have given to our great party, New Democracy. We achieved a great victory in the last elections, and we will now complete it. Today, if the country had not faced the "landmine" of proportional representation, we would already have had a strong and stable government with a comfortable parliamentary majority. The Greek people sent a thunderous message in the elections of May 21st. This was an accurate message before the elections of May 21st. I am not Prime Minister now, but I will be Prime Minister again with your support and vote on June 26th.
