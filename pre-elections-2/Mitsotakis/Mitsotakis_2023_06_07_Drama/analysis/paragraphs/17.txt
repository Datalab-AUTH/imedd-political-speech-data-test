Take, for example, the changes we need to make to the National Health System. I have never hidden that this is a big challenge for me. We have a four-year period to create a modern, new National Health System for our country. It is my personal commitment, and we will make it a reality. We will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors, many of whom are already serving as auxiliaries in the National Health System. We will support our hospitals - you know that we have ambitious plans for the hospital in Drama, not only for its energy upgrade, but also for securing resources for the emergency departments and the intensive care unit. We want every Greek, regardless of their location, to have access to quality health services, whether they are in a large city or a village, with support for health centers, more telemedicine, and more health personnel. This is a big personal challenge for me - we have learned the lessons of the pandemic, and we now know the strengths and weaknesses of the National Health System. The next four years will be dedicated to the great overhaul of the NHS. Believe me, because you know that I have a 'bad' habit of implementing the commitments I make to you.
