Friends, here in Drama, it is very important to send this message: the constant effort for a better Greece, a more advanced Greece, with better wages and a stronger economy, must continue today. That is why the ballot box on June 25th is so crucial. You know very well that if more parties enter the Parliament, the bar of self-reliance is raised. What the country needs today is a stable and strong government with a comfortable governing majority so that we can implement our programme of bold changes for the next four years.
