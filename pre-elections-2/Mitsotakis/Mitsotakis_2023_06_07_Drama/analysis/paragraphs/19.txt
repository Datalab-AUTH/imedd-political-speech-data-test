We did not hide our program. We presented it in great detail from the first ballot. We have talked about a Greece of growth, social cohesion, justice, and a strong Greece that invests in its Armed Forces and guards its borders. We have no hidden surprises or agendas to raise taxes. Taxes will only be reduced under New Democracy, as they have been for the past four years. We will go to the ballot box knowing that only New Democracy has a substantially convincing proposal for governance. The opposition is only interested in competing for primacy in the center-left. We are only voting for a government, not for an opposition, and the government that emerges in the next elections will have a heavy task: to continue to lead the country along this path of development.
