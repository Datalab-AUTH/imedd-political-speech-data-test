We have to realize that here, especially in your region, some of our fellow citizens, who I believe deep down belong to New Democracy, may have been seduced by certain parties and factions that have promoted their faith and their supposedly privileged relationship with Orthodoxy in order to gain votes. So I tell them clearly: Orthodoxy unites and does not divide. Our faith is not imprisoned within the confines of a few small factions. No one is more faithful than another, and we will not allow, under any circumstances, the instrumentalization of faith for political purposes. The Archbishop, the Patriarch, and we say it: we will not allow such phenomena. Caesar's to Caesar and God's to God. The relations between Church and State are separate. We do not mix faith with our political choices.
