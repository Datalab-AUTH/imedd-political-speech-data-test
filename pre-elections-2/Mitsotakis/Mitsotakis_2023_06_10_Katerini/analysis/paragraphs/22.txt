But growth is only one aspect of our program. On the other side of the coin is our social policy, health policy, and education policy for young children who attend school and university. It is our duty to offer them good quality public education and access to universities where they can graduate with degrees that will have a real impact on the labor market. We know the effort, stress, and anxiety that children experience when taking national examinations. They do not expect to enter university by submitting a blank sheet of paper. What they are asking for is a university that is not a sanctuary of lawlessness. We need to remove sledgehammers and grocers from universities. They are asking for quality curricula linked to the real economy so that when they graduate, they can claim a better tomorrow for themselves and their families.
