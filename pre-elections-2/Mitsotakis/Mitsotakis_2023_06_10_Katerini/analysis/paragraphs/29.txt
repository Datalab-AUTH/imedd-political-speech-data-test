Friends, I will not take long to present our program for the next four years. I will only emphasize that our programmatic discourse, as I mentioned earlier, is the only one that can be heard in Greek society today. We have proven that we know how to implement policies and put the country on a dynamic growth track. What I am asking of you here in Katerini is to give us the strength, give me the strength, so that this work that has begun does not stop and continues. We still have a lot to do, and I am certain that the confidence that citizens have shown us at the ballot box will be confirmed again on June 25th. There are 15 days left until the elections. I ask each and every one of you individually to make this final effort, not just to avoid complacency, because judging by your mass gathering here, there is no complacency. Now, I was considering whether or not to say this, but I will go ahead and say it: New Democracy is coming back with a vengeance. New Democracy is coming back with a vengeance at the ballot box on June 25th.
