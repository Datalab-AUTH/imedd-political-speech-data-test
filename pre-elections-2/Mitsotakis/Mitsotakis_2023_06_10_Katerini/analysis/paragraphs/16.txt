This is why the ballot on June 25th is so important. We need a stable majority the next day to enable us to make the great changes we have spoken to the Greek people about. Watch out, because we may have more parties in Parliament and the bar of self-reliance is rising. That is why we must set ourselves the goal of raising our percentage even further in the June 25th elections. The country needs a stable government today so that we can implement our program of major changes, which we have already presented to the Greek people. I want to remind you that even before the last elections, we were the only ones who went to all our meetings with our costed leaflet in our hands. The things that we tell you we will do, we know we can do. We do not feed rabbits with pebbles because we know very well that we will never jeopardize the relationship of trust that we have built up over the years. Unlike some others who can feed everything to everyone because they know full well that there is no way they will ever deliver on their program.
