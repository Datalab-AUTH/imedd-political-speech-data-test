But, friends and citizens, do not vote for what has been done. They vote for what will be done from now on. As much as they have trusted us because we have built a relationship of trust for what we have done, they believe and ask us to do even more in the second four years. I would say to you that the stronger the mandate we receive, the greater the responsibility that personally weighs on my shoulders to be able to change all the things that hurt us, hurt us, and hurt us in our country. And we know... This slogan is the most important, you know. It is the most important because there is only one danger in this ballot box for us, and that is the danger of complacency. The danger of the logic of "what the hell, it's all over, they've got more than 40%, maybe we'll go vote for a smaller party, maybe we'll go to the beach instead of voting."
