And for those of our citizens who have particular patriotic sensibilities, I simply ask them to reflect on what we have done during these four years to defend our national interests. I want you to remember what the situation in the Armed Forces was four years ago and where it is today. Consider whether you are more or less secure now that Rafale aircraft are flying in Greek skies. Consider whether you are more or less proud now that everyone recognizes that Greece is a pillar of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean. Finally, reflect on who the easy patriots in words are and who, in practice, stand for the patriotism of responsibility and results.
