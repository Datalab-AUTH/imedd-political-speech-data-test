I told you something else, perhaps the most important thing here in Macedonia. I told you that I want a safe and proud Greece. A Greece that will protect its borders in the air, on land, and at sea. And we have guarded our borders. We have reduced migration flows to a minimum, and from here, from Katerini, I give you the message: the fence on Evros will be completed, whether some people want it or not.
