Friends, I wanted to be with you today here in Katerini, Pieria, as I was not able to come during our first election period. First of all, I would like to say a big thank you for what you have done for our party, but I would like to ask you to work even harder, even more dynamically, to achieve an even greater victory on June 25. Because all of Greece is blue and will be blue again. I remember - and I am addressing our young people here - when I was your age, with some people a little older, we were fighting the great battles together with Konstantinos Mitsotakis and we were bringing New Democracy to unprecedented levels. And I wonder, how many people would have thought that we could bring New Democracy back to over 40%? And yet we did.
