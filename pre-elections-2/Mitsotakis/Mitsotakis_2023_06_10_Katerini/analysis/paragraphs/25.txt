We do not grant the monopoly of so-called progressivism to the Left. We are the real popular progressive party of this country and we are proving it. We prove it with deeds, not with words. In our vision for development, there is always sustainable tourism and support for a region with such unique comparative advantages as Pieria. As I arrived, I looked through the clouds and saw the unique monument of nature, Mount Olympus, and thought about how much more we can do to showcase it. Mount Olympus is one of the strongest brands in the world, and we can have tourism not just in the summer, but twelve months of the year.
