There are huge prospects for Pieria to showcase all its comparative advantages. But I ask you, if an investor comes today and says, "I want to invest here in Pieria," either in tourism or in a manufacturing plant, with which government will he feel more comfortable? The answer is one: he will feel comfortable with the government of New Democracy because good wages and many jobs need investors who will come to invest in our country.
