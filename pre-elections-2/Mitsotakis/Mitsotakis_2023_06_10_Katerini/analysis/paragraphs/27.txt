And of course, let us not forget that we stand first and foremost for environmentally friendly development, green development in a blue Greece. Throughout the month of May, the country was able to produce 50% of its electricity from renewable energy sources. This is of huge importance for all of us. It is of huge importance for households, which will be able to install photovoltaic panels on roofs tomorrow. It is of huge importance for our farmers, who will be able to have access to cheap energy production from photovoltaic systems tomorrow.
