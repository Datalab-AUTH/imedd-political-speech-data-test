I see our elected Regional Governor, Apostolos Tzitzikosta, in the audience and I want to inform you that we have an excellent cooperation with the Region to build new health structures together. The Region has done a lot for healthcare, including new education structures and schools that are being built through a partnership between the public and private sectors here in Katerini. These new infrastructures, including model schools and vocational high schools, are accompanied by something very important that our children will appreciate from next year when they start to see it in their schools: 36,000 interactive whiteboards for all our public schools, from the fifth grade to the third grade, also financed by the Recovery Fund.
