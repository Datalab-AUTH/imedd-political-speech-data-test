Thank you for the wonderful welcome. Thank you for your love and trust. Macedonia is blue, and the heart of New Democracy always beats in Macedonia, the birthplace of our national leader, Constantine Karamanlis. A big thank you to our amazing ONNEDites, who always give their own special pulse to all our gatherings. But above all, a big thank you to each and every one of you individually, who brought New Democracy, the great triumphant winner of the May 21 elections, with a percentage that exceeded the expectations of some but proved that New Democracy is the great broad force for unity and progress of our country. But, friends, the work is not over yet. On June 25, we are going to achieve an even greater victory. And to those who doubted this great party - because today we have a Champions League final - I have a word to say: the New Democracy jersey is very heavy, and it is blue and white, in the colors of our homeland.
