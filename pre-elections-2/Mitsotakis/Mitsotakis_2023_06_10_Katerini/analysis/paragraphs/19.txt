We will also do something else that we can commit to because we did it in the last four years. We will cut taxes even further. The business tax will be abolished within four years. The tax-free allowance will be increased by €1,000 for each child. Why are we doing this? Because my particular concern - and I know that this is something that concerns you very much - is to support the Greek family and to tackle the huge problem of under-birth. After all, let me remind you that we were the ones who put into practice - a few months after we won the elections - our commitment to give €2,000 for every child born in Greece today.
