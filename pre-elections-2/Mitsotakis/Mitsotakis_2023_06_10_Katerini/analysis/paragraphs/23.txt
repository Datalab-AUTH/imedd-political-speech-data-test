But the other side of social policy, my friends, is health. And there, make no mistake, we know that we still have a lot of work to do to support the National Health System. It has stood up through the difficult years of the pandemic and has shown great resilience. A huge thank you again from Katerini to our doctors, nurses, and all the staff of the National Health System. You here in Katerini know very well the great pressures that your hospital has been under. But we still have work to do in the National Health System, and I am the first to know that you cannot go to a public hospital and wait months for a scheduled surgery. All of us are hurt by those cases - the few, because they are exceptions, we have to say, but they too must be zeroed out - when the ambulance is asked to go somewhere and is delayed. These are all distortions that we must correct. We have the knowledge and financial tools to do it; we have secured 1.5 billion from the Recovery Fund to rebuild the Emergency Departments in our hospitals and to rebuild the Health Centres.
