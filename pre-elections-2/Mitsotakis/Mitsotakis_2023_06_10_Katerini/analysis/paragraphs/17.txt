Because there is only one proposal for governance in the country today, and that is the proposal of New Democracy. SYRIZA and PASOK have long since abdicated the responsibility of governing. All they are interested in is who will lead the centre-left constituency and occupy the penthouse. It is their own issue, not our business or the business of the majority of citizens. Do you know why? Because on June 25th, we are voting for the government, not the opposition. The next government, my friends, is the one that will be called upon to turn the steps we have taken into leaps and bounds.
