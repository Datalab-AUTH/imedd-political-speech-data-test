But I want to ask all of us together to work and find those fellow citizens, the thinking ones, who may not have trusted us even in the ballot box on May 21, and explain to them why this election is so important. We need to tell them that it is ultimately about our future and our lives. That is the only thing on which I agree with Mr Tsipras. He spoke today and said that this election is about our lives, and he is right. It is about young children who want a quality education and a good job; it is about the elderly who want access to quality healthcare; it is about our farmers who need to adapt and become more competitive. These elections are about everyone, and because they are about everyone, I am confident that people will once again trust New Democracy, the great progressive force for change. Together, we can achieve another great victory. I pledge to return here to Central Macedonia with good luck at the Thessaloniki International Fair in September, as the elected Prime Minister of the country with a fresh popular mandate, so that we can implement our plan for the Greece of the future. Let us go forward together to write our own history. Thank you very much for this amazing gathering. Let's go together for the great victory of the New Democracy. Goodbye and good luck.
