We did it. Why? Because the citizens rewarded the hard work we have done for four years. They rewarded the fact that we kept society on its feet during very difficult times, that we supported businesses and workers during the pandemic years. We put the economy back on the road to recovery. Citizens rewarded the consistency of our words and deeds. What did I tell you four years ago when I came back to Katerini? I told you that we would reduce taxes, and we did reduce taxes for all Greeks.
