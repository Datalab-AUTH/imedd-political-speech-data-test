No, friends, we will all be at the ballot box. The ballot box is empty and needs to be refilled with many blue ballots, and we need to increase our numbers even more. Especially here in Katerini, especially here in Pieria, we have room to do even better. We will turn things around in Pieria and get another MP. But we have to do one more thing, which is to honestly look at the election results.
