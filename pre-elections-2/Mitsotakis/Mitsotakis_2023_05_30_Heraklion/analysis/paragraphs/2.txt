So, friends, from Crete we have sent a strong message in the May 21st elections. A message of continuity, determination, unity, and progress for Greece. This result may have surprised some, but having traveled throughout Greece, I saw in the eyes of the people their trust and support for a government that has endured challenges but kept the country standing and safe. I saw citizens seeking a different politics, free from the toxicities, vulgarities, and divisions of the past. In these elections, those who see Greece as bright and united emerged victorious, while those who see it as dark and divided were defeated. The winners spoke truthfully, faced difficulties head-on, presented a coherent program for the country's future, and did not hide. The losers resorted to familiar lies and fairy tales, which we have rejected time and time again. The Greek people have spoken and crushed them.
