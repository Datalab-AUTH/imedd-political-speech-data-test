This is a tangible and real vision for our island, and only we can make it happen. That is why we need a stable government in the next day that will sweep away obstacles and put into practice a visionary program. This program should not only take care of certain social classes but should focus primarily on the weakest of our fellow citizens. If we have proven anything during these four years, it is that we are the broad popular party that stands by our weakest fellow citizens. We have no class bias.
