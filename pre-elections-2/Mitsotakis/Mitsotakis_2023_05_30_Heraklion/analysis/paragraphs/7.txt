Only New Democracy has not only a plan but also the will and determination to take on the responsibility of governance. The greater the percentage we receive, the heavier the weight on our shoulders. The responsibility is significant when the Greek people trust you with such a large percentage. Everyone else is hiding. Mr. Androulakis told us that "even if New Democracy has 149 MPs, I am not interested in governing, I am interested in staying in opposition." I said to him, "Very well done." So stay in the opposition, argue with Tsipras about who will lead the opposition, and let us do the work.
