Because I cannot imagine that all those who are now telling us - note that this is the new argument that I hear - "we do not want Mitsotakis to be omnipotent" actually mean it. I hear PASOK saying it. Excuse me, but PASOK won by more than 40% three times and I do not remember anyone making the same claim. In any case, to those who talk about the 'omnipotence of Mitsotakis', my answer is: the Greek people are omnipotent and we respect their will. And if he achieves a strong percentage, it will be because he wants it and he has finally convinced himself of the need for a strong, self-reliant government.
