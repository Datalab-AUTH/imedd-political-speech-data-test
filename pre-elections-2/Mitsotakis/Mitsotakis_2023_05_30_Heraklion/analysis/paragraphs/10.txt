A short while ago, ten minutes ago, I had the opportunity to call the Turkish President to congratulate him on his re-election and to tell him that I look forward to and expect a new period in Greek-Turkish relations. You know that our country is always willing to extend a hand of friendship to Turkey, but never to undermine its sovereignty and sovereign rights. There are issues that I will never discuss with Turkey; they are off the agenda. And I hope that the climate with Turkey will improve, but no one can guarantee that this will be the case. Because only I know for four years how difficult the situation we had to manage with Turkey was and what a struggle we had to go through to be in a position of strength today against a country that has a revisionist strategy towards our country. That is why a stable government is a prerequisite so that we can all sleep well at night.
