But friends, beware: on May 21st we achieved a great victory, but this victory is incomplete. It will be completed on the evening of June 25th. Then our work will be finished. When I came and spoke to you in Heraklion a few weeks ago, I warned you about the 'bombshell' of proportional representation. Now you understand exactly what I meant. If the electoral law of enhanced proportional representation - the one we have used for most elections in the post-election period - had been in force on May 21st, we would already have a strong government today, with an absolute majority for New Democracy. This, then, which some people did not allow us to achieve because they played with the electoral law, we will achieve on June 25th, for a strong and stable government with a four-year horizon, with New Democracy at the helm of the country.
