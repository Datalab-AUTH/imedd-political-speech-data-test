Our program is of great importance to me, especially the continuation of a path towards economic recovery and prosperity. It is no coincidence that here in Crete, in Heraklion, we are seeing the fruits of this new growth that is coming to our country. Remember what I am saying to you: the best days for Crete are ahead of us. I firmly believe that. Look at how well our tourism is doing. Tourism means more investment, more jobs, and better wages. I want to remind you that the sectoral agreement signed here by the hoteliers and hotel employees of Crete provides much better wages than the minimum wage for young people who work in our hotels and in the tourism sector, and wages are increasing. When investments are made, when we train our staff, and when workers can claim better wages, wages increase. Some people ask us, "But how will you get the average wage to 1,500 euros?" Because we know that wages increase through investment, mobilizing the real economy, and reducing unemployment. We have shown that we can make it happen.
