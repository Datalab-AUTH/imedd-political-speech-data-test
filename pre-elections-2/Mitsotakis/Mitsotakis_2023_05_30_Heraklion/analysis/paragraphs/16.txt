For a Crete that is a leader in green energy, yesterday we produced all of the country's energy from the sun and wind for several hours of the day. This means lower electricity prices for households, businesses, and farmers. Our vision is to export energy with the great interconnection to mainland Greece instead of importing and burning dirty fuel oil.
