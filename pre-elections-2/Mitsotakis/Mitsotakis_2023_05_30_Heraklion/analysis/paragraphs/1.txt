Thank you for your love, support, and trust. Thank you for achieving what some thought was impossible: making Heraklion blue and all of Crete blue. Today is a special moment for me personally. A few weeks ago, I came to talk to you, holding our final rally here in Heraklion. I was impressed by the crowd, your passion, love, and smiles. But who would have thought we would win Heraklion by 13 points? Who would have thought we would win Rethymno by 16 points over SYRIZA, Lassithi by 18 points, and my city, Chania, by 21 points? For the many old friends of Konstantinos Mitsotakis, I am sure that he will be smiling today from up there where he is.
