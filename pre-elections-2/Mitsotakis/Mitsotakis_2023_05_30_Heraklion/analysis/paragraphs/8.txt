In this election, we are not voting for the opposition. We are voting for the government. In every election, we vote for the government. So, I want to ask all of our executives, our elected MPs, and all of our amazing candidates, this time free of the stress of the cross, to fight together for one goal: on June 25, the country will have a strong and stable government of New Democracy, which is more necessary today than ever before. I want to stress that this is not a football match, where the score of the first game counts in the rematch. The score of the first match gives us joy and satisfaction, but it does not count at the ballot box on June 25. We must start again from the beginning, and we must fill the ballot boxes, which will be empty that morning, with many millions of New Democracy ballot papers in the evening.
