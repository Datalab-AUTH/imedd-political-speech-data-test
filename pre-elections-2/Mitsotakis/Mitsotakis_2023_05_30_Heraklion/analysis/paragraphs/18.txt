We - and I think that it is of great value to say this here, in the homeland of Eleftherios Venizelos - are ultimately the successors of the great liberal progressive legacy of Crete. Not those who have abused it - cleverly, I must say, and effectively for several decades. Therefore, I would say that Crete is finally returning to its political bedrock. To the bed of great progressive liberalism, expressed today by our great party, New Democracy.
