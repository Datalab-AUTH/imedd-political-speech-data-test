And therefore, friends, we cannot allow any complacency. You know very well that in the next Parliament we may have more than five parties. The more parties that enter Parliament, the higher the bar of self-reliance. It is more necessary than ever not only to reach the percentage that we achieved in the elections, but to exceed it. This is the goal that we are all setting together. We must not only have as many people come and vote for us as came to this ballot box, but also for the new people who trusted us at the ballot box to understand that today in the country there is essentially no other proposal on the substance.
