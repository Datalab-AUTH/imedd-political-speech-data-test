Friends, the result was not only a geographical one. New Democracy achieved impressive results in the popular districts of Western Athens. Despite what some people said, New Democracy was first among our youth as well. First among our young people, among young children, among 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds who voted for the first time. Because young people know that they are not just "fuel" for the populism of some. What are young people asking of us? They are asking for good education, good public universities, good jobs for the next day, and all of this can only be guaranteed by our party, New Democracy. So they turned their eyes to us, they rewarded seriousness. They have rewarded a structured political discourse and closed the door to those who had no other intention than to return them to the past.
