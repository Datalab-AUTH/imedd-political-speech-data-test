Never has an opposition party suffered such a defeat as Syriza did. However, even after the elections, they have not learned anything. They blame the mainstream media for "distorting their views", as if we did not listen carefully to Mr. Katrougalos' plans to crush freelancers. They refuse to take responsibility for their own shortcomings. They have not changed, forgotten anything, or learned anything. We leave them in the past where they belong. We are glad that in this election, all regions of the country, except for one small exception, voted for New Democracy. Our slogan, "all Greece is blue", has become a reality. Greece will remain blue like the sky and sea in the upcoming elections on June 25th. All of Crete is blue.
