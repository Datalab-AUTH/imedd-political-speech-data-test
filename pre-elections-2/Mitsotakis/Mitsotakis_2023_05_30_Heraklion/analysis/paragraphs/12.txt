Because you have seen that the euphemism of simple proportional representation has collapsed. All those who were talking about simple proportional representation were fighting among themselves, just as we had predicted. And in the end, the only solution for our country is a strong, self-reliant government of New Democracy. However, I want to emphasize that the New Democracy, which I have the honor to lead, is a new New Democracy. It has different characteristics, and I believe that this is what has allowed many of you who are here with us today, and who might have voted for other parties, to side with Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy today. I am proud of this, and I thank you for your support. I want you to know that I will repay your trust and your love in full.
