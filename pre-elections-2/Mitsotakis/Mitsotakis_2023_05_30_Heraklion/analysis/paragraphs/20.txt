But for this to happen - I will say it again - we need on the evening of June 25th there to be only one big winner, as there was on May 21st, and that is none other than our party, New Democracy. So, I want to assure you again that for me, your love, your trust, especially what happened in Crete, especially what happened in Heraklion, has a special significance. Today, your presence, but also the result of the elections, spoke to my heart. And for that, I will be forever grateful. So, let us go together for the great victory of the New Democracy, to celebrate together on 25 June. Even greater percentages, for New Democracy as champion, for Crete as champion, for Crete always blue, in a Greece only blue. Be well, thank you very much. Good strength, good race, and early to the polls. And the youth, first, you will vote and then you will go swimming. Be well, thank you very much. Good strength. Have a good race.
