Thank you for your love, support, and trust. Thank you for achieving what some thought was impossible: making Heraklion blue and all of Crete blue. Today is a special moment for me personally. A few weeks ago, I came to talk to you, holding our final rally here in Heraklion. I was impressed by the crowd, your passion, love, and smiles. But who would have thought we would win Heraklion by 13 points? Who would have thought we would win Rethymno by 16 points over SYRIZA, Lassithi by 18 points, and my city, Chania, by 21 points? For the many old friends of Konstantinos Mitsotakis, I am sure that he will be smiling today from up there where he is.

So, friends, from Crete we have sent a strong message in the May 21st elections. A message of continuity, determination, unity, and progress for Greece. This result may have surprised some, but having traveled throughout Greece, I saw in the eyes of the people their trust and support for a government that has endured challenges but kept the country standing and safe. I saw citizens seeking a different politics, free from the toxicities, vulgarities, and divisions of the past. In these elections, those who see Greece as bright and united emerged victorious, while those who see it as dark and divided were defeated. The winners spoke truthfully, faced difficulties head-on, presented a coherent program for the country's future, and did not hide. The losers resorted to familiar lies and fairy tales, which we have rejected time and time again. The Greek people have spoken and crushed them.

Never has an opposition party suffered such a defeat as Syriza did. However, even after the elections, they have not learned anything. They blame the mainstream media for "distorting their views", as if we did not listen carefully to Mr. Katrougalos' plans to crush freelancers. They refuse to take responsibility for their own shortcomings. They have not changed, forgotten anything, or learned anything. We leave them in the past where they belong. We are glad that in this election, all regions of the country, except for one small exception, voted for New Democracy. Our slogan, "all Greece is blue", has become a reality. Greece will remain blue like the sky and sea in the upcoming elections on June 25th. All of Crete is blue.

Friends, the result was not only a geographical one. New Democracy achieved impressive results in the popular districts of Western Athens. Despite what some people said, New Democracy was first among our youth as well. First among our young people, among young children, among 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds who voted for the first time. Because young people know that they are not just "fuel" for the populism of some. What are young people asking of us? They are asking for good education, good public universities, good jobs for the next day, and all of this can only be guaranteed by our party, New Democracy. So they turned their eyes to us, they rewarded seriousness. They have rewarded a structured political discourse and closed the door to those who had no other intention than to return them to the past.

But friends, beware: on May 21st we achieved a great victory, but this victory is incomplete. It will be completed on the evening of June 25th. Then our work will be finished. When I came and spoke to you in Heraklion a few weeks ago, I warned you about the 'bombshell' of proportional representation. Now you understand exactly what I meant. If the electoral law of enhanced proportional representation - the one we have used for most elections in the post-election period - had been in force on May 21st, we would already have a strong government today, with an absolute majority for New Democracy. This, then, which some people did not allow us to achieve because they played with the electoral law, we will achieve on June 25th, for a strong and stable government with a four-year horizon, with New Democracy at the helm of the country.

And therefore, friends, we cannot allow any complacency. You know very well that in the next Parliament we may have more than five parties. The more parties that enter Parliament, the higher the bar of self-reliance. It is more necessary than ever not only to reach the percentage that we achieved in the elections, but to exceed it. This is the goal that we are all setting together. We must not only have as many people come and vote for us as came to this ballot box, but also for the new people who trusted us at the ballot box to understand that today in the country there is essentially no other proposal on the substance.

Only New Democracy has not only a plan but also the will and determination to take on the responsibility of governance. The greater the percentage we receive, the heavier the weight on our shoulders. The responsibility is significant when the Greek people trust you with such a large percentage. Everyone else is hiding. Mr. Androulakis told us that "even if New Democracy has 149 MPs, I am not interested in governing, I am interested in staying in opposition." I said to him, "Very well done." So stay in the opposition, argue with Tsipras about who will lead the opposition, and let us do the work.

In this election, we are not voting for the opposition. We are voting for the government. In every election, we vote for the government. So, I want to ask all of our executives, our elected MPs, and all of our amazing candidates, this time free of the stress of the cross, to fight together for one goal: on June 25, the country will have a strong and stable government of New Democracy, which is more necessary today than ever before. I want to stress that this is not a football match, where the score of the first game counts in the rematch. The score of the first match gives us joy and satisfaction, but it does not count at the ballot box on June 25. We must start again from the beginning, and we must fill the ballot boxes, which will be empty that morning, with many millions of New Democracy ballot papers in the evening.

We will achieve our goal. We will achieve it because now, yes, we have the wind in our sails. We know we are winners, but not arrogant. Careful: not arrogant. As I said, if one feeling should fill us today, it is the responsibility of governing in difficult circumstances. And if I insist, friends, on the need for stability, it is precisely because I know how difficult things are; you see that threats are lurking out of nowhere. In the last two days, for the first time, we have been cyber-attacked as a country, of such a magnitude that we have been concerned about the conduct of the qualifying exams. In the past, we have been cyber-attacked and have repelled cyber-attacks. But it is just one indication of how difficult the world we live in is and how necessary it is to have a firm hand on the wheel of the country.

A short while ago, ten minutes ago, I had the opportunity to call the Turkish President to congratulate him on his re-election and to tell him that I look forward to and expect a new period in Greek-Turkish relations. You know that our country is always willing to extend a hand of friendship to Turkey, but never to undermine its sovereignty and sovereign rights. There are issues that I will never discuss with Turkey; they are off the agenda. And I hope that the climate with Turkey will improve, but no one can guarantee that this will be the case. Because only I know for four years how difficult the situation we had to manage with Turkey was and what a struggle we had to go through to be in a position of strength today against a country that has a revisionist strategy towards our country. That is why a stable government is a prerequisite so that we can all sleep well at night.

Because I cannot imagine that all those who are now telling us - note that this is the new argument that I hear - "we do not want Mitsotakis to be omnipotent" actually mean it. I hear PASOK saying it. Excuse me, but PASOK won by more than 40% three times and I do not remember anyone making the same claim. In any case, to those who talk about the 'omnipotence of Mitsotakis', my answer is: the Greek people are omnipotent and we respect their will. And if he achieves a strong percentage, it will be because he wants it and he has finally convinced himself of the need for a strong, self-reliant government.

Because you have seen that the euphemism of simple proportional representation has collapsed. All those who were talking about simple proportional representation were fighting among themselves, just as we had predicted. And in the end, the only solution for our country is a strong, self-reliant government of New Democracy. However, I want to emphasize that the New Democracy, which I have the honor to lead, is a new New Democracy. It has different characteristics, and I believe that this is what has allowed many of you who are here with us today, and who might have voted for other parties, to side with Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy today. I am proud of this, and I thank you for your support. I want you to know that I will repay your trust and your love in full.

So, a stable government for the next day is a prerequisite not only for us to have peace of mind regarding geopolitical challenges, but also to continue the very important work that we started four years ago. This work is now beginning to take shape and people are starting to see it. The citizens have rewarded us for our efforts and the way we have been politicking. Above all, they have voted for us for what we will do from now on.

Our program is of great importance to me, especially the continuation of a path towards economic recovery and prosperity. It is no coincidence that here in Crete, in Heraklion, we are seeing the fruits of this new growth that is coming to our country. Remember what I am saying to you: the best days for Crete are ahead of us. I firmly believe that. Look at how well our tourism is doing. Tourism means more investment, more jobs, and better wages. I want to remind you that the sectoral agreement signed here by the hoteliers and hotel employees of Crete provides much better wages than the minimum wage for young people who work in our hotels and in the tourism sector, and wages are increasing. When investments are made, when we train our staff, and when workers can claim better wages, wages increase. Some people ask us, "But how will you get the average wage to 1,500 euros?" Because we know that wages increase through investment, mobilizing the real economy, and reducing unemployment. We have shown that we can make it happen.

And, of course, we are the ones who will be happy that the next four years will be the four years of very big projects for our island, for our Crete. With a Northern Road Axis which - at last - is getting on track. At last, a project, a vision of a lifetime for Crete is finally coming to fruition. For the large section of the concession contract from Heraklion to Chania, we have already had three bids. It will be a very competitive process. We are now absolutely certain that this road will be built and Crete will finally have the road it deserves. For a new airport which is already under construction. For the major irrigation projects that are being carried out throughout the island.

For a Crete that is a leader in green energy, yesterday we produced all of the country's energy from the sun and wind for several hours of the day. This means lower electricity prices for households, businesses, and farmers. Our vision is to export energy with the great interconnection to mainland Greece instead of importing and burning dirty fuel oil.

This is a tangible and real vision for our island, and only we can make it happen. That is why we need a stable government in the next day that will sweep away obstacles and put into practice a visionary program. This program should not only take care of certain social classes but should focus primarily on the weakest of our fellow citizens. If we have proven anything during these four years, it is that we are the broad popular party that stands by our weakest fellow citizens. We have no class bias.

We - and I think that it is of great value to say this here, in the homeland of Eleftherios Venizelos - are ultimately the successors of the great liberal progressive legacy of Crete. Not those who have abused it - cleverly, I must say, and effectively for several decades. Therefore, I would say that Crete is finally returning to its political bedrock. To the bed of great progressive liberalism, expressed today by our great party, New Democracy.

We want this program to help us implement it. We know how to govern effectively. We have learned from our mistakes. We are all more experienced, and I myself know much more today than I did in 2019. We are ready on the day after the election, June 26, to roll up our sleeves again and work for the benefit of all of you.

But for this to happen - I will say it again - we need on the evening of June 25th there to be only one big winner, as there was on May 21st, and that is none other than our party, New Democracy. So, I want to assure you again that for me, your love, your trust, especially what happened in Crete, especially what happened in Heraklion, has a special significance. Today, your presence, but also the result of the elections, spoke to my heart. And for that, I will be forever grateful. So, let us go together for the great victory of the New Democracy, to celebrate together on 25 June. Even greater percentages, for New Democracy as champion, for Crete as champion, for Crete always blue, in a Greece only blue. Be well, thank you very much. Good strength, good race, and early to the polls. And the youth, first, you will vote and then you will go swimming. Be well, thank you very much. Good strength. Have a good race.
