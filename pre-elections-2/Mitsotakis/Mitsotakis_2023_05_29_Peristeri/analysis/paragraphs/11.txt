So we, friends, will start today to resume this very good fight, to continue the fight of the ballot box on 21 May. I will go around the whole of Greece again, as I have already done many times, and I will do it once more to convey two things: firstly, the message of the need for a stable government with a four-year horizon. I think this has been explained in simple terms to all and sundry. Everybody understands that in this difficult international geopolitical environment - you see, the elections in Turkey have been completed, Turkey now has a government and a president - we do not yet have an elected government. But we will have one on 26 June. So, one issue: the need for political stability.
