Thank you, thank you, thank you. The last time I was in West Athens, I asked you to commit to a major breakthrough: to "paint" West Athens blue, and we did it. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. But we did not only paint West Athens blue, we painted the whole of Greece blue. You made this slogan a reality.I wanted, friends, in our first official election speech after the dissolution of the Parliament - the decree was signed a few hours ago - to be here in Peristeri and say a big thank you from the bottom of my heart for the struggle we fought together, for the great victory we achieved in the elections of May 21.Especially here in West Athens, I see many old friends among us and I remember them. A special thank you to all those who have followed my personal political path since 2003, 20 years ago. We have gone through good times and bad times together, but we are happy today to celebrate another great victory in the great history of our party, the New Democracy.
