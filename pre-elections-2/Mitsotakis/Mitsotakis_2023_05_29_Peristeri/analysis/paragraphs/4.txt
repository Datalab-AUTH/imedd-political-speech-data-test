I must tell you that this great, broad dynamic of the victory of the New Democracy was created by many points of reference. We managed to make openings in geographical areas and in social groups where some people thought we could not do well. What do all those who predicted that New Democracy would be behind in youth have to say? We were first in our youth as well; we were first in the 17 to 30 age group, for the simple reason that we finally talked about your real problems, about the education you want, about the jobs we want to create. We don't see youth as just fuel for the populism and anger that some people want to ignite.
