Indeed, the citizens have rewarded us. They have rewarded the effort of these four years. They have rewarded our crisis management, they have rewarded the fact that we have put the economy back on a growth track, that we have kept our commitments, that we have guarded our borders, that we have strengthened our armed forces. But there was something else that I think is very important: the citizens turned their backs on toxicity, on hatred, on empathy, on division. Division was defeated and unity won. Toxicity has been defeated and decency has won. Populism has been defeated and a coherent, well-founded and costed political discourse has won, which only we, as New Democracy, have managed to express in these elections.
