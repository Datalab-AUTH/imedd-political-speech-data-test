A second issue - even more important, and this ultimately concerns all of you much more - is which is the party that will be able to implement these great changes that we have committed to.I hope and I hope that in this election period our opponents will also understand that politics is not made with slogans, with slogans, with toxicity, with insults, with tweets.Come, we tell them, let's debate our political programme. Come on, let's compare, after all, who can keep the country on a dynamic growth trajectory; who can achieve investment grade. The investment grade, I will not tire of saying this for those who are not experts in public finance, is for all and sundry. The moment we get it we will all have lower borrowing rates and that is important for households, for businesses and ultimately for our own state.
