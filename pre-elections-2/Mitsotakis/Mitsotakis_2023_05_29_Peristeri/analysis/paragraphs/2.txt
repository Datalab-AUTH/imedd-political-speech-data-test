Indeed, friends, many people may have been surprised by this election result and I want to remind you that for the first time in the post-election period, a party is increasing its share and the absolute number of votes, after four years in government. And for the first time since 1974, the first party has more than double the number of votes of the second party.Where have all those people gone who predicted that the election would be a derby? I wonder. I wonder where they hid. But, my friends, I was confident about the election result and I was confident about the performance of New Democracy in this election, for the simple reason that, going around Greece and all of Athens - and especially all of western Athens - I saw something that others may not have been able to see: that Greek society is changing, that Greek society is progressing and that Greek society today has a demand for a substantial programmatic discourse.
