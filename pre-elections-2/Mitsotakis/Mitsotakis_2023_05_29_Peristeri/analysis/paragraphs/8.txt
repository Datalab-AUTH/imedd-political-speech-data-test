And this victory will be the victory that will put a definitive end to a cycle of uncertainty opened by the opposition's choice to plague us with the system of proportional representation. Today, the country would already have a strong and stable government if it were not for the simple proportional representation system. Therefore, there is only one way to deactivate this "landmine" once and for all: that is to give New Democracy an even higher percentage in the elections of 25 June. Be careful. The mathematics of elections change from ballot box to ballot box. We should all consider that possibly on June 25 the bar of self-reliance will be raised. The more parties that enter the House, the more difficult self-reliance becomes. And what the country does not need today is an unstable government with a marginal majority. What the country needs is a stable government with a strong majority to make the big changes, the big reforms happen.
