We approach this election campaign with the enthusiasm of a winner but - I want to emphasise - also with the modesty and responsibility of a party that recognises the weight of responsibility that the Greek people place on our shoulders. And it is a heavy responsibility. I am the first to feel it, which is why I will not tolerate any arrogance. We want enthusiasm, we want loud voices, we want the flags high, but we do not want arrogance, we do not want contempt for our opponents. We are here to unite our country and to always appeal to our fellow citizens who did not vote for us, telling them to join us. And let everyone know that the next day, as I did in 2019, I must - if you trust me - be and will be the Prime Minister of all Greeks. This is what the office and responsibility of Prime Minister of the country demands. So let us go together to fight this fight. I would like to say a big thank you to our party organisations for their excellent support of the electoral process. To our volunteers, to our ONNEDites, to all the organisational staff.Again, the ballot boxes, all the ballot boxes, will have New Democracy election representatives in the next elections. I pass by everywhere, I see polling booths, the only polling booths that are open today are the New Democracy booths. The others have already shut down and I doubt if they will reopen until the elections.So let's do this beautiful struggle together. Let's increase our percentages in Western Athens even more. We can and we will. Steadily, boldly, forward for a self-reliant Greece.Be well. Thank you very much. Good race and good strength. Be well.
