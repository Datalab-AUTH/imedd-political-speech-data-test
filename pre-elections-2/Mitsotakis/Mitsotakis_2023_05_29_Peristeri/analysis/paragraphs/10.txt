So I say to them: ladies and gentlemen, wake up, on 25 June we are voting for government, not for opposition. What happens in opposition is up to you. The citizens care about how the country is governed and how the next day we will have a stable government that can provide Greek citizens with security and prospects. And the only thing they care about, the only thing that PASOK and SYRIZA are united on, is their desire to have a weak government in the end.And what are some people telling us? "We don't care if we have 149 MPs, we don't care. We want to be in opposition all the time." So I say to them: look, I don't know of any other election where there is actually a candidate for Prime Minister and a party that claims the responsibility of governing.
