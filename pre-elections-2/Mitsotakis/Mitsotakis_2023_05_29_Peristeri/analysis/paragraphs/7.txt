But we, friends, we know very well that the result, this important result, this great victory today means nothing. It means nothing - hold on to what I am telling you. The ballot box on June 25 will be empty again. There is no first and second round here. This is not a municipal election. Our percentage does not count on the June 25 ballot. Everything starts all over again.I want to ask you together - and our MPs and our candidate MPs, now free from the stress of the cross - to fight the battle together for our party alone. So that we can once again be the big winners, at the ballot box on 25 June.
