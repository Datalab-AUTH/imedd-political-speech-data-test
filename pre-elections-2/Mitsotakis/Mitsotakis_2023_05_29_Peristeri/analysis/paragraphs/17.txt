But, of course, we will not stop there. We will continue the great reforms we have made in our education. The University of West Attica is now finding its feet, as we had planned. And we want at this moment to strengthen not only our universities but also our public IEKs, which provide very important specializations to children who will not want to go to university; first and foremost, we want to strengthen our schools. Interactive whiteboards: 36,000 new interactive whiteboards in all schools, by next year they will be in place, with resources from the Recovery Fund. Kindergarten through four years. And of course, something to which I attach great importance, support for the working family and especially the working mother.
