As it was the same here in western Athens in the more "popular" districts -within quotation marks, keep the quotation marks, they have value-. We bent over the problems of our weakest fellow citizens and proved that only New Democracy, after all, is the great popular progressive party of this country; we kept society and the weakest upright during the pandemic. We supported households during the energy crisis. And we were, after all, the ones who launched the most progressive social policy, which is none other than the creation of many good jobs. And West Athens rewarded us.
