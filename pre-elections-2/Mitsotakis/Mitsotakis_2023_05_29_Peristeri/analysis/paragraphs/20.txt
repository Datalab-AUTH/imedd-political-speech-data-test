All this, my friends, constitutes the "canvas" of the election campaign, as it will be shaped between now and 25 June. And I will repeat what I said at the beginning: there is one thing we cannot tolerate and that is complacency. I know that there will be many people today who may be thinking 'what the hell, the election is over, I don't need to go and vote, I don't need to go to the island or go to the village where I may or may not vote and vote in Athens'. Say a big "no" to them, we have to finish the job we started, by June 25 we have to have an even higher percentage than what we got on May 21. And we can, we can achieve it. Greece has turned blue and will remain blue. And a small corner of Greece that stayed pink, we know why it stayed pink, we have no illusions. And we will make it blue and the whole of Greece will really be blue in the next elections.
