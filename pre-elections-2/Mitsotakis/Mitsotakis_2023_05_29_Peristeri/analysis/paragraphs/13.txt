So, we know and we can bring in investment and we can bring in many new jobs, especially here in West Athens. We, I will not tire of saying it, will bring the average wage to 1,500 euros and the minimum wage to 950 euros. We know and we can do it; we are the ones who will continue to support society, but not by overtaxing everyone, especially the middle class, but from the surplus of growth. We are not the ones who are going to cripple the self-employed again by returning to the Katrougalos law. You know what you are paying in employer contributions with New Democracy in government, and you know that the next four years will be a four-year period in which taxes will be reduced even further. Yes, and the business tax, in the four-year horizon, will also be a thing of the past, we will also be done with this meme tax.
