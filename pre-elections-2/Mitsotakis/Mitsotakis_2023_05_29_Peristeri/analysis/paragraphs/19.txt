And of course, don't forget, friends - I was saying this before the last elections, and I repeat it now - the very important dimension that all foreign policy issues have in the next four years.Our world, our neighbourhood will not become easier. There will be problems. I had the opportunity today to publicly express my congratulations to President ErdoÄŸan on his re-election. I will have the opportunity to talk to him by phone in the coming hours. And to convey to him what I say on every occasion, that Greece will always extend a hand of friendship to Turkey, and it is not us who seek tension. But we know very well what the limits are that no one can cross. Disputes are resolved with international law as a guide. And the country's effort to have a strong Armed Forces will continue, exactly as we have planned. The same applies, of course, to the guarding of our borders. The fence on the Evros will be completed and the Coast Guard will continue to guard our maritime borders.
