Every now and then these last few days I go and I'm told, "Prime Minister." I say, "Look, I'm not the Prime Minister." If you want me to be Prime Minister again, you all need to come and vote, not go to the beach or think that this election battle is over.So that is the issue and the real demand of the next election: a stable government with a comfortable majority against those who today are only interested in who will lead the opposition.
