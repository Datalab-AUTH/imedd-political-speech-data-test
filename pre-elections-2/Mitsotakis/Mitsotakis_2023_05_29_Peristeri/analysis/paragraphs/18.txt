We don't talk enough about the biggest long-term problem of Greek society. It's not a problem, it's a bomb. And I'm talking about under-generation. Underfertility is not only dealt with, as we have done, by giving 2,000 euros at the birth of each child. Yes, we did that too, remember; it is tackled first and foremost by how we support families, working mothers, with more nurseries, with full-day kindergartens, with programmes such as the Neighbourhood Nannies. We want more children in Greece, we need them, and we know what we have to do to support families, especially working women, who - let us not kid ourselves - ultimately bear the brunt of the burden.
