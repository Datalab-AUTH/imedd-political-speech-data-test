So, the continuation of the growth path is through a stable and strong New Democracy. And we are not only saying this, all the foreign houses are also saying it. You can see the satisfaction from the election result, but when the economy is doing well, and the citizens are doing well, too. Because as unemployment goes down, friends, the power of the worker to negotiate a better wage is strengthened. That's why wages are going up.Inflation is still a problem, we recognize that, we've helped, but you can see that it's already starting to come down. But in a year's time, when we don't have an acute inflation problem, wages will be higher and taxes will be lower. That's ultimately how everyone's disposable income is supported, with permanent increases, not temporary bonuses. Bonuses are useful. And I am proud that our party is the one that has finally kept Greek society on its feet in a difficult time.
