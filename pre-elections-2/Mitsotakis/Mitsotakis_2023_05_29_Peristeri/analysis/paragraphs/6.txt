For those of you who don't know - I wonder, I don't even know if that was the "bet" - 12 points ahead of West Athens. If you wanted to place a bet, it wouldn't give you odds on that. And yet, it was done. And some people to this day still don't understand why they lost and what happened on the night of May 21; indeed, I'm not surprised, because they never understood how society itself had changed and progressed during those four years.
