Of course, we know that there is no prosperity without national sovereignty. The one that is protected - and when you don't see them, I assure you they are there and flying - by 24 new Rafale fighters, 84 upgraded F-16s, and from 2028 F-35s. Three new frigates, new corvettes, because alongside our reborn defence industry are our reborn shipyards; we have breathed life back into the shipbuilding zone. We have saved people from unemployment. We got the shipyards going again. Do you know why? Because - we make no secret of it - for us, national defence is the ultimate end in itself. A non-negotiable priority for our great patriotic party.
