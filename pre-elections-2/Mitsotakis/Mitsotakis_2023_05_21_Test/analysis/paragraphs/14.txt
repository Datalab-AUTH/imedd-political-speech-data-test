As you can see, friends, we know what we have achieved, we know where we have stumbled, but we know what we have to do by policy area and by region of the country.All of this is encapsulated in our programme. A governance programme that is costed in five chapters, you have seen it, you have studied it, for a productive, social, fair, digital, strong Greece.Today is a day of celebration, I will not bore you by talking about it in detail. But I will ask you to keep four major goals that we have set for the next four years: better wages for all and for all. Decent health care, a new National Health System. An effective state with evaluation everywhere. And of course, a proud and strong homeland.
