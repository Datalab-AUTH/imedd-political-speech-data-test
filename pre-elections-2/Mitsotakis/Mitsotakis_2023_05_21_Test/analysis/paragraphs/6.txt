So what we promised you, we have done. Less taxes and contributions, more investment and new jobs, with benefits that will always be in line with the strength of the economy, a friendly and digital state at home but reliable and proud abroad, without the burden of immigration and with an armoured defence.This is what I have talked to you about from this platform. And where are we today? To be able to say: "we said it and we did it". We are paying 50 fewer taxes, and 7 billion in taxes have been lifted from your shoulders. ENVIA has been reduced, not by 30% as we said, but by 35%. The first rate has fallen from 22% to 9%. We have abolished the solidarity contribution for everyone and parents now pass on their property to their children free of charge.
