And not only that. During the successive crises - and I am very proud of this because we are the great people's party with a social footprint - we supported the economy, society and labour, but we also stimulated growth, with investments that reduced unemployment, and some of this wealth returned to society in the form of permanent increases. By stimulating entrepreneurship we created 300,000 new jobs, primarily for young people and for those who want to return home from abroad.The minimum wage went from 650 to 780 euros. Our pensioners saw for the first time in 12 years an increase of almost 8%. And those who are wronged by the Katrougalos personal difference will continue to be supported by our government until this difference is finally erased.
