Then we saw him - as the leader of the losers - calling for a "government of the losers". Later he proposed a "government of tolerance". And now he is proposing, he is whispering something about a "special purpose government". That is, mind you, a "government of total destruction"; in other words, an endless hodgepodge of contrivances that gamble with the future of the country. Block their path to instability, to uncertainty, to decadence, to regression, with your vote on the coming Sunday.And of course, as we approach the polls, it didn't take long for them to be fully revealed, with Mr Katrougalos confessing the day before yesterday his plan: a return to his own social security system - hear this well, freelancers - with the first measure being the tripling of contributions on the incomes of freelancers. And yesterday he withdrew from SYRIZA. Not deleted, of course. As was the case with Mr Polakis.Because the truth is that Mr Katrougalos has assured five times that SYRIZA's hidden agenda foresees a new tax storm. He even explained that they have found ways to overcome the decision of the Council of State. After all, don't forget that when we changed the way freelancers were taxed, Tsipras voted against the relevant provision.Why? Because, quite simply, what Mr Katrougalos testified to is their real agenda. Block their way with your vote on Sunday.Unwittingly, Mr Katrougalos revealed that SYRIZA remains a relentless persecutor of the middle class. With an incorrigible leader whose every word is a lie and every action a disaster, a threat, who prefers chaos to his own defeat.
