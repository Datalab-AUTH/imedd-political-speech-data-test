I have talked about modern health care many times, hold back the 80 hospitals and 156 health centres that are being upgraded with Recovery Fund money so that waiting times are significantly reduced. And, of course, 10,000 appointments of health workers, nurses first and foremost, but also doctors; and, for the first time, a screening programme extended to all citizens for all major diseases. Especially for women listening to us, they know how important the breast cancer prevention program is. Policies that really do save lives.
