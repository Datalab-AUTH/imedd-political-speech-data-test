But on the diplomatic front we have not stood still. For the first time, the country extended its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea to 12 nautical miles. We established maritime zones with Italy and Egypt. We have shown that we can resolve such issues in accordance with international law.  We signed - even if some people fought them - strategic agreements with France and the United States. We are now an international energy hub. And yes, I am proud that the voice of Greece is now heard loudly from Brussels to the US Congress, so we can say it without arrogance: what we have said we have done. What we are doing is first and foremost for the younger generation, for our children. So that they can have the right to claim the right to live in a better country than that of their parents.
