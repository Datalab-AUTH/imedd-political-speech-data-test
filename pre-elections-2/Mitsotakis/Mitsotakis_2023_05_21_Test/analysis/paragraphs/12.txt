Friends and friends, a lot has happened. But I am the first to know that much more needs to be done. Things have not always turned out the way we wanted them to. We have also identified weaknesses and made mistakes. These are phenomena that lead us to combine yesterday's negative experiences with tomorrow's positive expectations.The economy, for example, has objectively done very well. The average income was supported, the vulnerable were supported, but I know, first hand, that wages in our country are still low and are being "nibbled" by imported precision.The National Health System, yes, it has withstood the pandemic, we have doubled the number of ICUs, we have hired 18,000 doctors and nurses. But we still have shortages and cots, and we have delays in surgeries; so does the state. Gov.gr is a real revolution, it has abolished the queues of bureaucracy. And, yes, the NFKA now pays out pensions on time, in two months, not two years, as was needed at one time. But recent tragedies have shown us that much still needs to change; and the same is true of education. We are the ones who, after 12 years, made 25,000 permanent teacher appointments. We have doubled the number of standard and experimental schools; soon 36,000 public school classrooms will have interactive whiteboards.
