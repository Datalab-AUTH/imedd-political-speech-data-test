I have personally taken stock of these four years. I have seen our successes, I have seen our weaknesses. I have weighed myself and my responsibilities in the mirror.So I can look you in the eye and honestly tell you that if there are two verbs that express me, they are "I feel" and "I try". As I have had a duty, I have given my soul to the responsibility you have entrusted to me to lead the country. And that is what I will continue to do. The choice now is whether to move forward or turn back. And I pass this great responsibility on to you.
