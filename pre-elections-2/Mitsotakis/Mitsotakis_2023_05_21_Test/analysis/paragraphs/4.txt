From exactly the same position, then, I was emphasizing verbatim: "important for us is the guarding of our borders and dealing with migration. Because Greece has borders on land and in the air, and these borders must be guarded." "we will reduce taxes on individuals and businesses", because it is a measure that benefits citizens and at the same time has a developmental character.Four years later, everyone can judge the consistency between our words and our deeds. I have honoured the former and put the latter into practice. I have remained true to my duty; and with the same strength that we implemented what we said yesterday, we will do tomorrow what we are planning today. I ask you again today to renew the truth agreement that we first signed in 2019.I will not stop trying until this agreement becomes the final contract of the country with a better future for all. I sign this before you tonight, closing a cycle but beginning a new era.On Sunday night, New Democracy will be the first government to achieve a second major consecutive election victory in years.
