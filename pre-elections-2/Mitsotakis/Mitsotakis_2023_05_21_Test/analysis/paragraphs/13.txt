But this work must continue and the steps must be taken in leaps and bounds, while new speeds are also required for major projects.Indeed, today, new roads are crossing the country, hundreds of interventions are being made for our farmers, of huge importance for irrigation.Yesterday I had the opportunity to admire the Thessaloniki Metro, which is becoming a reality, along with the city's antiquities. A tangible project, not a project painted on tarpaulins. But the future cannot wait and, in the basin in particular, our priority is the construction of Line 4 of the Metro, the extension of Line 2 to Ilion, the huge upgrade of the Suburban Railway in West Attica, the coastal front, and of course the double redevelopment of Botanikos. Today the contract for the construction of the new Panathinaikos stadium was signed, which will be ready in the summer of 2026. For us Olympians, congratulations also on qualifying for the Final Four.And of course, by 2027, 2,000 new buses, most of them electric, will be on the streets of the capital.
