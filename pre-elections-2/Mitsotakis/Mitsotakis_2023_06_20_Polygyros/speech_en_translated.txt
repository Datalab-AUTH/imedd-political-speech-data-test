Mr. Regional Governor, Mayors, friends, and Young Democrats, I have a habit of not changing my ways, and you may remember that last week, before the July 2019 elections, I was on a road trip to Halkidiki. And just as you brought us luck in the party during that election, I am sure that Halkidiki will again send a message of great victory in the ballot box on June 25th. I feel that the Mayor has said it all, sending a message of vigilance, a message that we should not be complacent. The elections are taking place on June 25th with all the ballot boxes empty, which must be refilled with many New Democracy ballots.

The result of May 21 was significant for the Greek society's will to continue on the path of progress and national pride. However, it must be reaffirmed at the ballot box on June 25 with even higher percentages than those achieved in the previous elections. We now have a clear understanding of the electoral map, knowing where we did very well, where we did well, and where we can improve. In every region I visit, I want us to set specific targets that relate to the constituency I am in.

So, here in Halkidiki, our goal is to win two seats. Things are simple; we need to increase our percentage even more. We can achieve this, but we must also squeeze some smaller parties and groups that have appeared mainly on the right of New Democracy.

Parties that were completely unknown appealed to religious sentiment and I think they misled some of our fellow citizens who believed that this is how they were expressing their faith by voting for a particular small party. I have said it many times, and I repeat it to you: Orthodoxy is too big to be imprisoned within the confines of a party. Faith unites us, it does not divide us, and under no circumstances can the issues of the Church be the subject of a partisan election debate. So, I want to send a message to all and to everyone: we should leave church matters outside of political disagreements and not involve Orthodoxy in any way with the issues that have to do with the governance of the country. I want to believe that this message will be heard by our fellow citizens here in Halkidiki and they may re-evaluate their choices. Just as I think that you will also evaluate here, especially in Macedonia, in northern Greece, what responsible patriotism actually means in practice.

One of the big issues of the June 25th election is who will manage the country's foreign and defense issues in a very difficult geopolitical situation and who can continue this great effort that we have started to make the country a strong pole of stability and development in the Eastern Mediterranean. I don't need to tell you much about what we have achieved in the four years that we have been called upon to manage the fate of the country. The only thing I can tell you is that this robust foreign and defense policy will continue under a New Democracy government. We will continue to invest in our Armed Forces, to build strong alliances. Greece's voice will be heard in Europe. Yes, we will continue to protect our borders, as we have done for the past four years with efficiency and humanity.

The Evros fence will be completed despite some people fighting it. We will leave those who, instead of defending the country, target it and ultimately give arguments to Turkish propaganda to the judgment of the citizens. It is very sad what happened in recent days with the targeting of the Coast Guard by SYRIZA for the tragic shipwreck of Pylos. It is unfortunate to see the same arguments being reproduced by official Turkey and Turkish propaganda.

But let the citizens be the judge of that. I think they know us all well enough by now and have made their choices. Essentially, we are asking them to make the same choice again at the ballot box on June 25th, which was to reward the hard work done over four years. However, it was also a choice of expectation about what can be done from now on and how we can continue on the path of growth.

How can each region of the country exploit its comparative advantages, as the Vice-Regional Governor said, so that we can create additional wealth, keep young people in our country, and essentially support the development dynamics of each Greek region?

These are the issues that concern you. I know, for example, that you have had a lot of damage now with the recent rains. Our main concern, our first concern the next day, is to see how we can cover the farmers who were hit by this unprecedented bad weather. You know, we have done that. We have been doing that for four years now. And while we are talking about agricultural compensation, I want to remind you that in total, our government has made available through ELGA more than one billion euros to support the primary sector from the effects of climate change. Of that one billion euros, my friends, only 500 million euros were farmers' contributions. The remaining 500 million came from the national budget.

But it was a conscious decision that we made not to abandon our farmers and our primary sector and to support all those who suffered damage from extreme weather events. However, we could not have taken this step if the economy was not growing and if we did not have growth surpluses.

That is why growth is so important. That is why the "health" of public finances is so important after all. Because if public finances are not healthy, the state cannot come to support society and citizens when they need it.

So we will be on the front line with the new leadership of the Ministry of Rural Development to see the damage that has been done, which ones are covered by ELGA, and which ones are not covered by ELGA. In any case, we are going to reform the ELGA regulation so that we can adapt to the new facts of climate change, which oblige us all to look at environmental protection issues through a different lens.

And that is why it is so important, here in Halkidiki. We have discussed this many times, including the last time I was here: the management of water resources. The Havria Dam is a commitment being implemented by the government of New Democracy, despite the difficulties. We now have the financial tools and will find a company to build it to the right specifications. It is my commitment to Halkidiki so that we can have all the irrigation potential to cover a large part of the regional unit, while also protecting Halkidiki from flooding phenomena that have affected the area in the past.

Here in Halkidiki, the dynamic primary sector coexists with high-quality, exportable products. These are the products we ultimately want, as they bring good prices to our farmers and contribute to a tourism development that is gaining new momentum and can bring more wealth to the entire region.

We are going for another great tourist season. However, we understand that our tourism must be viewed in a different context, with sustainable and high-quality investments.

Quality investments, my friends, ultimately result in better wages. When targeting an audience with higher paying potential, there is potential for higher wages in the future. It is necessary to provide higher wages to workers, which ultimately increases wages nationwide. This is a central policy choice of ours.

That is what we will vote for this coming Sunday. We will vote on the way the welfare state functions and on our health. For me, the reform of the National Health System is a central political priority. It is a personal bet that I want to win, and I will personally supervise the new leadership of the Ministry of Health so that all the major reforms we have launched can be implemented. This includes the modernization of our hospitals and health centers, the 10,000 recruitments that must be made in the health sector, and the policies concerning the Personal Doctor and preventive examinations, which are so important.

Do you know what it is, let's say, for a woman over 50 who is in a village in Halkidiki to suddenly receive a message from the state saying "go and have a preventive mammogram in a public or private facility, but free of charge"? And from these screening mammograms, we have identified, to date, more than 8,000 women with early breast cancer. I know that screening tests sometimes cause fear, but it's much better to find the disease early because then we are absolutely certain that we can cure it. That basically means having a comprehensive approach to public health issues. This is the plan that I am asking you for the strength and authority to be able to implement.

That is what we will vote for this coming Sunday. We will vote for our lives, our future, our children's future, and our pensions. Pensions will continue to increase under a New Democracy government. We will have more growth and continue to support all pensioners who have fallen victim to the personal differential and have not seen the expected increases. These are all commitments of New Democracy. To put all of this into practice, we must have a solid parliamentary majority on Sunday night.

Because we are likely to have more than five parties in the next Parliament, I ask you to raise our expectations even higher. This way, we can have a stable government with a comfortable parliamentary majority on Sunday night and a four-year horizon. This government can implement all the major changes I have talked to you about and continue to keep the country's ship stable in difficult circumstances.

We now have a caretaker government. It is doing the best it can. But if the May 21 elections had been held under the electoral system under which the June 25 elections will be held, I would not be here today as a Prime Ministerial candidate. I would already be the elected Prime Minister of the country. We would now be dealing with how to handle the problems from the unprecedented downpour. I would be here to talk about your problems, not to seek your vote.

So we are losing a month at a cost to the state because every election costs money and causes inconvenience for some people who have to go back to vote. Why? Because of the whim of proportional representation. This is what it's all about. They voted for simple proportional representation only because they thought it would create a problem for New Democracy and result in a "government of losers". Finally, they realized that this plan blew up in their hands. It backfired, but it also backfired on the country. So, in order to correct all these wrongs, I ask you from Halkidiki, from Polygyros, to make an extra effort. Let us work to increase our percentage even further. We can.

I am sure that all of you know some of our fellow citizens who, at the last minute, chose not to vote for us. So, I ask you to make this effort and explain to them why it is important that we have a stable government with a four-year horizon tomorrow. This is not the time for experimentation. We cannot take risks at this moment with the future of the country. Only today, the stable government of New Democracy can ensure a future of progress and stability. After all, there is no other proposal for governance.

Everyone else is competing to see who will be first in opposition. Who will have the penthouse of the center-left apartment building? Except that in elections, we vote for the government, not the opposition. Let them sort this out after the elections. They'll have time after all. They will also have time to reflect on what went wrong, why they fell to 20%. Because when everything was presented as black, everything toxic, "it's all Mitsotakis' fault." Everything that was happening in the world was Mitsotakis' fault. Everything was his fault. In any case, let them find their way. It is not our main concern at the moment. Our main concern is how to govern the country, and that is why I am asking you for this strength, for this strong mandate so that we can move the country forward.

One last thing, friends. I know very well that the percentage we achieved surprised us and may surprise all of you. It is indeed the first time - since Konstantinos Karamanlis founded New Democracy in 1974 - that we have never been in government and increased our percentages. This is the first time we have achieved this. We will increase them even more in this election. However, the higher the percentage, the heavier the responsibility, and the more unacceptable the manifestation of any arrogance and complacency.

I want you to know that I will be absolutely adamant about that. The citizens place a heavy responsibility on our shoulders. They are giving us a mandate, and I believe they will give it to us again. They are giving us the mandate to "Go and change what we don't like. Correct your mistakes, be better." That trust - one thing I want you to know - we will honor that trust, and I will honor it to the full.

I will return your love and trust by working even harder starting from June 26th. We will roll up our sleeves, correct mistakes, solve problems, and continue the great effort we started four years ago for a Greece that no longer resembles the Greece of 2019. I guarantee that in four years, we will be talking about a different and much better Greece. I ask for your strength to make this vision a reality and to write our own history together. Be well. Thank you very much. Good strength, good fight, and as we said, we are here for the second term. Thank you very much.
