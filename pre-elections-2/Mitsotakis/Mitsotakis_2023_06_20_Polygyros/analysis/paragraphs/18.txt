Do you know what it is, let's say, for a woman over 50 who is in a village in Halkidiki to suddenly receive a message from the state saying "go and have a preventive mammogram in a public or private facility, but free of charge"? And from these screening mammograms, we have identified, to date, more than 8,000 women with early breast cancer. I know that screening tests sometimes cause fear, but it's much better to find the disease early because then we are absolutely certain that we can cure it. That basically means having a comprehensive approach to public health issues. This is the plan that I am asking you for the strength and authority to be able to implement.
