The result of May 21 was significant for the Greek society's will to continue on the path of progress and national pride. However, it must be reaffirmed at the ballot box on June 25 with even higher percentages than those achieved in the previous elections. We now have a clear understanding of the electoral map, knowing where we did very well, where we did well, and where we can improve. In every region I visit, I want us to set specific targets that relate to the constituency I am in.
