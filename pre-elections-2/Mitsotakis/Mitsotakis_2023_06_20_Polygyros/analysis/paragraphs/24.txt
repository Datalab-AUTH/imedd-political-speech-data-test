Everyone else is competing to see who will be first in opposition. Who will have the penthouse of the center-left apartment building? Except that in elections, we vote for the government, not the opposition. Let them sort this out after the elections. They'll have time after all. They will also have time to reflect on what went wrong, why they fell to 20%. Because when everything was presented as black, everything toxic, "it's all Mitsotakis' fault." Everything that was happening in the world was Mitsotakis' fault. Everything was his fault. In any case, let them find their way. It is not our main concern at the moment. Our main concern is how to govern the country, and that is why I am asking you for this strength, for this strong mandate so that we can move the country forward.
