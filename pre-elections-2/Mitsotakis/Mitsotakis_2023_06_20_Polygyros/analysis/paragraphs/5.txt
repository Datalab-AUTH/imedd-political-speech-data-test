One of the big issues of the June 25th election is who will manage the country's foreign and defense issues in a very difficult geopolitical situation and who can continue this great effort that we have started to make the country a strong pole of stability and development in the Eastern Mediterranean. I don't need to tell you much about what we have achieved in the four years that we have been called upon to manage the fate of the country. The only thing I can tell you is that this robust foreign and defense policy will continue under a New Democracy government. We will continue to invest in our Armed Forces, to build strong alliances. Greece's voice will be heard in Europe. Yes, we will continue to protect our borders, as we have done for the past four years with efficiency and humanity.
