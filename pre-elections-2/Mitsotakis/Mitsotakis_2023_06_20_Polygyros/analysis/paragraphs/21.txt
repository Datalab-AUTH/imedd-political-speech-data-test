We now have a caretaker government. It is doing the best it can. But if the May 21 elections had been held under the electoral system under which the June 25 elections will be held, I would not be here today as a Prime Ministerial candidate. I would already be the elected Prime Minister of the country. We would now be dealing with how to handle the problems from the unprecedented downpour. I would be here to talk about your problems, not to seek your vote.
