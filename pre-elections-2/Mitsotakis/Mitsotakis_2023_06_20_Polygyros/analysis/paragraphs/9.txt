These are the issues that concern you. I know, for example, that you have had a lot of damage now with the recent rains. Our main concern, our first concern the next day, is to see how we can cover the farmers who were hit by this unprecedented bad weather. You know, we have done that. We have been doing that for four years now. And while we are talking about agricultural compensation, I want to remind you that in total, our government has made available through ELGA more than one billion euros to support the primary sector from the effects of climate change. Of that one billion euros, my friends, only 500 million euros were farmers' contributions. The remaining 500 million came from the national budget.
