So we are losing a month at a cost to the state because every election costs money and causes inconvenience for some people who have to go back to vote. Why? Because of the whim of proportional representation. This is what it's all about. They voted for simple proportional representation only because they thought it would create a problem for New Democracy and result in a "government of losers". Finally, they realized that this plan blew up in their hands. It backfired, but it also backfired on the country. So, in order to correct all these wrongs, I ask you from Halkidiki, from Polygyros, to make an extra effort. Let us work to increase our percentage even further. We can.
