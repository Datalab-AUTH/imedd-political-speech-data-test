I am sure that all of you know some of our fellow citizens who, at the last minute, chose not to vote for us. So, I ask you to make this effort and explain to them why it is important that we have a stable government with a four-year horizon tomorrow. This is not the time for experimentation. We cannot take risks at this moment with the future of the country. Only today, the stable government of New Democracy can ensure a future of progress and stability. After all, there is no other proposal for governance.
