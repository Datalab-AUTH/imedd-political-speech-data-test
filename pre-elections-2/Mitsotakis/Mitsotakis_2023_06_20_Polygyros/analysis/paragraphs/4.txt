Parties that were completely unknown appealed to religious sentiment and I think they misled some of our fellow citizens who believed that this is how they were expressing their faith by voting for a particular small party. I have said it many times, and I repeat it to you: Orthodoxy is too big to be imprisoned within the confines of a party. Faith unites us, it does not divide us, and under no circumstances can the issues of the Church be the subject of a partisan election debate. So, I want to send a message to all and to everyone: we should leave church matters outside of political disagreements and not involve Orthodoxy in any way with the issues that have to do with the governance of the country. I want to believe that this message will be heard by our fellow citizens here in Halkidiki and they may re-evaluate their choices. Just as I think that you will also evaluate here, especially in Macedonia, in northern Greece, what responsible patriotism actually means in practice.
