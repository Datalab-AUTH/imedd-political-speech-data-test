One last thing, friends. I know very well that the percentage we achieved surprised us and may surprise all of you. It is indeed the first time - since Konstantinos Karamanlis founded New Democracy in 1974 - that we have never been in government and increased our percentages. This is the first time we have achieved this. We will increase them even more in this election. However, the higher the percentage, the heavier the responsibility, and the more unacceptable the manifestation of any arrogance and complacency.
