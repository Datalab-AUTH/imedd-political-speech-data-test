Because we are likely to have more than five parties in the next Parliament, I ask you to raise our expectations even higher. This way, we can have a stable government with a comfortable parliamentary majority on Sunday night and a four-year horizon. This government can implement all the major changes I have talked to you about and continue to keep the country's ship stable in difficult circumstances.
