That is what we will vote for this coming Sunday. We will vote for our lives, our future, our children's future, and our pensions. Pensions will continue to increase under a New Democracy government. We will have more growth and continue to support all pensioners who have fallen victim to the personal differential and have not seen the expected increases. These are all commitments of New Democracy. To put all of this into practice, we must have a solid parliamentary majority on Sunday night.
