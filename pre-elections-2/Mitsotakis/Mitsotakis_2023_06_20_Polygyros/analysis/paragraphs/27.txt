I will return your love and trust by working even harder starting from June 26th. We will roll up our sleeves, correct mistakes, solve problems, and continue the great effort we started four years ago for a Greece that no longer resembles the Greece of 2019. I guarantee that in four years, we will be talking about a different and much better Greece. I ask for your strength to make this vision a reality and to write our own history together. Be well. Thank you very much. Good strength, good fight, and as we said, we are here for the second term. Thank you very much.
