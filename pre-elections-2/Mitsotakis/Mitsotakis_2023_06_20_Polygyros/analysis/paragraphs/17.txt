That is what we will vote for this coming Sunday. We will vote on the way the welfare state functions and on our health. For me, the reform of the National Health System is a central political priority. It is a personal bet that I want to win, and I will personally supervise the new leadership of the Ministry of Health so that all the major reforms we have launched can be implemented. This includes the modernization of our hospitals and health centers, the 10,000 recruitments that must be made in the health sector, and the policies concerning the Personal Doctor and preventive examinations, which are so important.
