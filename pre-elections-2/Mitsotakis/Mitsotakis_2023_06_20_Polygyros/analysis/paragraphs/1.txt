Mr. Regional Governor, Mayors, friends, and Young Democrats, I have a habit of not changing my ways, and you may remember that last week, before the July 2019 elections, I was on a road trip to Halkidiki. And just as you brought us luck in the party during that election, I am sure that Halkidiki will again send a message of great victory in the ballot box on June 25th. I feel that the Mayor has said it all, sending a message of vigilance, a message that we should not be complacent. The elections are taking place on June 25th with all the ballot boxes empty, which must be refilled with many New Democracy ballots.
