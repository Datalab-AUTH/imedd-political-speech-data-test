I want you to know that I will be absolutely adamant about that. The citizens place a heavy responsibility on our shoulders. They are giving us a mandate, and I believe they will give it to us again. They are giving us the mandate to "Go and change what we don't like. Correct your mistakes, be better." That trust - one thing I want you to know - we will honor that trust, and I will honor it to the full.
