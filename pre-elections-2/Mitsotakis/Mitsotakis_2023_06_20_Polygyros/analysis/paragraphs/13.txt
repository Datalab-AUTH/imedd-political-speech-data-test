And that is why it is so important, here in Halkidiki. We have discussed this many times, including the last time I was here: the management of water resources. The Havria Dam is a commitment being implemented by the government of New Democracy, despite the difficulties. We now have the financial tools and will find a company to build it to the right specifications. It is my commitment to Halkidiki so that we can have all the irrigation potential to cover a large part of the regional unit, while also protecting Halkidiki from flooding phenomena that have affected the area in the past.
