Because if there is one thing we can be proud of, my friends, it is that despite the great difficulties that we have faced over the past four years - and there have been many - we have managed to keep all of our key election commitments, most importantly the ones we made on the economy. We said we would cut taxes and we have cut taxes and contributions, just as we had committed to during the election. This tax cut was accompanied, ladies and gentlemen, by a boom in investment, which has enabled the country today to have growth rates that are now much higher than the European Union average. And this is of particular importance because if we do not have high growth rates, my friends, we cannot reduce unemployment, we cannot look forward to more and better-paid jobs, and there will also be no surplus to support health, to support education, and to stand by society in every contingency. And we have had many contingencies - as you know - in the last four years.
