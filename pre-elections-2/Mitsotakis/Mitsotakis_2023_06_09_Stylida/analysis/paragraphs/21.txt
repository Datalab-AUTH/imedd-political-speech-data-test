So, friends, we will vote for all of this. We will vote for our future, better wages, better healthcare, and better education for the children on the balcony who are in tutorials and preparing for their national exams. We want these children, who will attend public universities, to know that they will receive a degree that will impact the labor market and enable them to find a good job. We believe in public universities with libraries, not sledgehammers. We want children to attend good universities that provide safe, quality education, are market-connected, and offer degrees that count and have a bearing on the job market.
