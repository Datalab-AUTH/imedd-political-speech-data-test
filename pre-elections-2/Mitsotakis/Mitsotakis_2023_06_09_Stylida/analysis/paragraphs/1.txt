Thank you very much for this warm welcome and, first and foremost, for your support of our great party, New Democracy. You have given us excellent percentages, allowing us to reach 40% nationally, increase our percentages from what we achieved in 2019, and look to the future with even more optimism. Now that we have set the bar high, we know that we must work even harder to win the ballot on June 25th with an even higher percentage, securing self-reliance, which is a prerequisite for a stable and strong government to continue the important work we have done over the past four years, my friends.
