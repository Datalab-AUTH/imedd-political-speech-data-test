And I want you to know that this is my commitment, my commitment to a life attitude, a political behavior attitude. If you honor us with your trust, know that we will repay you in full. We will take Greece much further forward, steadily, boldly, for a better Greece, for a more prosperous Greece, for a more stable Greece. Be well, thank you very much, good strength, good luck, good fight with many more elected deputies here in Fthiotida. We are also fighting this race, again and again, and with victory. Be well, thank you very much, thank you for this very nice reception.
