So, for all of these things, we will vote in the ballot box on June 25th. Let me remind you from Stylida: the ballot box is empty. The percentage that we received in the May 21st elections is not a given, is it? We must all go and vote again, and possibly bring some people who have not yet decided to vote for us, so that on the evening of June 25th, the Greek people will have sent a clear message: we want New Democracy to be strong and to continue on the path of uplifting the country. That is the message we will send. But one last thing, which is important: a strong New Democracy does not mean an arrogant New Democracy. The stronger the mandate we receive on the evening of June 25th, the greater the responsibility that falls on our shoulders to be humble and to work even harder to solve your problems.
