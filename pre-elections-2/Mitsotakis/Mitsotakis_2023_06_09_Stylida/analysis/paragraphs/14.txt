Therefore, this ballot is crucial. It is crucial that no vote is lost because you know very well that even with the possibility of more parties in Parliament, the bar for self-reliance is raised. That is why we need a very strong percentage, an even better percentage than the one we achieved in the May 21 elections, to have the strong self-reliance that is a prerequisite for us to make the great changes that the country needs. We have a program, not just costed but presented in great detail, from the previous elections, for a Greece that is productive, fair, social, digital, and environmentally green because Greece is blue, all of Greece is blue politically.
