And of course, there is an important development project underway, which is none other than the new commercial port of Stylida. We will include this project in the Recovery Fund, and when completed, it will give new prospects to the port of Stylida. This will allow for the importation of important products from the wider region and mainly for exportation. Speaking of ports, I remember meeting with our elected candidates Christos, Giannis, George, and the rest of the electorate in Agios Konstantinos a few months ago. We promised that the port would be delivered on time, and we kept our commitment. The citizens know this, which is why when we present our program speech for the next four years, we do so with a reserve of credibility. We know that what we say today is part of the 'truth agreement' that we are called upon to reaffirm.
