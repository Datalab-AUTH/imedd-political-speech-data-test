I have to tell you, friends, that the election result may have surprised many people, but it did not surprise me. I know very well that in this election, the paradigm of politics has changed. The citizens said no to toxicity, vulgarity, and division. They rewarded unity, hard work, a well-founded programmatic discourse, and, above all, measurable results.
