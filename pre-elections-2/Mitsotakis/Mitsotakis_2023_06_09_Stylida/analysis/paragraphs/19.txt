We know how to implement this policy, but we also understand that we must implement a policy with a social dimension. That is why, long before the recent tragic incidents involving the ambulance service, we stated that our primary concern is a modern National Health System that will provide quality healthcare services to all, regardless of their location. We discussed the need to improve ambulance response times and reduce wait times for regular surgeries. These are all programs that have been initiated by New Democracy, and we want you to know that the National Health System is a top priority for us. We will implement our plan for a new NHS, recruit more staff, including doctors and nurses, and allocate resources from the Recovery Fund to construct health centers and emergency departments in our hospitals. We will also support the establishment of Personal Doctors.
