So, friends, all of this must be weighed by citizens in the lead-up to the ballot box in 16 days. What kind of economy do we want? How do we continue dynamic growth? How do we improve wages? There is a big debate about wages, and I understand it completely. I often meet young people who say to me, "Wages in our country are still low," and they are right. Yes, I tell them, but we were the ones who raised the minimum wage from 650 euros to 780 euros. So when we say it will go up to 950 euros, we have credibility and can achieve it. However, wages will only increase with good investments, such as those being made. As unemployment decreases, the bargaining power of workers will increase, and wages will rise. There is no other magic solution.
