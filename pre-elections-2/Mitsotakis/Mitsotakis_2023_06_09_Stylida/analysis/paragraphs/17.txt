And of course, because Greece has credibility today, you can be absolutely sure and confident that it can also defend a patriotic foreign policy, with greater confidence and with greater certainty. Yesterday, we had an important development in Europe. After many negotiations, the new framework of regulations governing asylum and immigration was agreed upon. And for the first time, the specificity of the countries on the external borders of the European Union has been recognized. Interventions such as the need for mandatory solidarity in the management of the refugee problem were accepted. Greece played its part in all of this, but it did so from a position of strength. Because when in 2020 some people tried to make our borders a "sieve", we put up a wall and said, "We will not allow this to happen," and we secured the borders of our country, which are also the borders of Europe.
