And we achieved this - which is another important success of economic policy - without compromising fiscal stability. Because one thing you can be sure of with this government is that we paid our debts. We are well aware of how traumatic the experience of the memoranda was, and we know that fiscal stability is non-negotiable. The country will never again return to the dark ages of needing foreign support to survive; we will stand on our own. We will soon regain investment grade status with a strong and self-reliant New Democracy government.
