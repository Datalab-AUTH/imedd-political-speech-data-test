And this "truth deal," which is based first and foremost on trust between citizens and the political system and political representatives, I am not prepared to negotiate. We have a well-worked-out plan for the economy that is costed. Why is it costed? Because it is part of the medium-term program that we have already sent to the European Union. We know that we can spend nine billion over the next four years and finance the interventions that we have committed to. And we are absolutely sure that if we fall short, we will fall short for the better and not for the worse, as we have always exceeded the targets we set.
