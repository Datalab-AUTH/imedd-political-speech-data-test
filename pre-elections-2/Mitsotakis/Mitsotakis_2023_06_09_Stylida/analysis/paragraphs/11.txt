And if the law of enhanced proportional representation had been in force during the previous elections, which will be implemented again in the elections on June 25th, the country would already have had a strong government. However, all I am asking is that we go back to doing exactly what we did on May 21st and more, to have an even higher percentage and to close once and for all this traumatic cycle of simple proportional representation, which undermines the foundations of the stability of the political system. We warned about these problems of proportional representation in good time. We had warned that there was no chance of a government emerging from these parties.
