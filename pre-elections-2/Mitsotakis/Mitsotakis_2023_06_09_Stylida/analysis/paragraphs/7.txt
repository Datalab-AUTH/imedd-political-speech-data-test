And every time we exceeded the targets, we said, "Very well, we have a surplus which is a growth surplus" - notice, not a tax surplus. We didn't crush the middle class, the farmers, or the freelancers with taxes. "We're going to return this growth surplus to society and support those who need it most." We did this, for example, just before the elections, with the extraordinary support for those who have been crushed by the personal difference of the Katrougalos law, and we said that we will continue to support these pensioners until the personal difference is erased. And this is the big difference, friends, of a party that emphasizes growth with a social dimension and knows that in order to distribute wealth, you must first create it. We create new wealth and then come to distribute it fairly to society, but also to support society whenever there is a real need.
