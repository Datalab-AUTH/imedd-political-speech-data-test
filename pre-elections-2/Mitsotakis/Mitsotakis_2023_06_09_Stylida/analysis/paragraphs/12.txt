Some people did not listen to us. Now I have heard Mr. Tsipras say "mea culpa", "sorry", that is, for the simple proportional representation. Look, if Mr. Tsipras starts the mea culpa, I do not know where he will stop. Because he has a lot of mea culpa to say. He has a lot of mea culpa to say for deceiving the Greeks, for the lies with which he has once again fed the citizens in this election period. He should say a mea culpa for the toxicity and the black propaganda with which he bombarded us in the previous election campaign. I am here and I am speaking in a predominantly rural area and I remember - you will remember it too - a spot that Syriza put out before the last election, with a farmer in a semi-truck carrying some artichokes, and even the artichokes were black.
