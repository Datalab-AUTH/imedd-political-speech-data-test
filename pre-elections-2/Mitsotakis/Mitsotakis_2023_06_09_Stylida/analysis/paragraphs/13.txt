And I asked myself, "Is this the image of Greece today?" I am not saying that we have solved all the problems of the primary sector. But here, you have given me a very nice basket with your quality olives. They are nice, standardized, with a designation of origin, and with good prices abroad. This is not the picture that the opposition presented before the elections - of a black Greece in which almost all the citizens are starving and suffering. We are not saying that we have solved all the problems, friends, but there is certainly no doubt about one thing, and the citizens confirmed it in the ballot box on May 21st: Greece in 2023 is in a much better state than it was in 2019, and the best is still ahead of us.
