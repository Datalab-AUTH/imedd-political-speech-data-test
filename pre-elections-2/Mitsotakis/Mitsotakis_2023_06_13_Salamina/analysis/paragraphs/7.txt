So, my friends, the next four years will be the years in which the country can truly make a big leap and face many difficulties and pathologies from the past. I know that we have not yet solved all the problems, including the persistent issue of food accuracy. However, this issue cannot be solved solely by Market Pass type aid. It must primarily be addressed through better wages and further tax cuts to support the disposable income of all Greek women and men. We aim to support the Greek family first and foremost by abolishing the tax on businesses over a four-year period and increasing the tax-free allowance for every child.
