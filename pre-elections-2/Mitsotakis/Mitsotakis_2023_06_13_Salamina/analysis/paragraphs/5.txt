But the next day, my friends, is a day on which our country must continue on the path to prosperity. You know that one of my central commitments is very specific: the next four years will be a period of better wages for every Greek. They ask us, "How will you achieve better wages?" I say to them, let's see what we have achieved in the last four years. I was looking at the ERGANIS figures and we went from an average salary of 1,050 euros to an average salary of 1,200 euros in four years. We will reach an average salary in our country of 1,500 euros and a minimum wage of 950 euros. With more investment, more jobs, and employers who will be prepared to pay better wages because they will be looking for skilled staff, as is the case, for example, in Perama, on the other side of the passage. I went there before the elections and saw the shipbuilding zone bustling with life again, with happy workers who are getting good wages and, at last, looking to the future with optimism. The same thing happened in Elefsina, the same thing is happening in Skaramagas, and the same thing is happening here in Salamina.
