The only reason we don't have it is precisely because some people chose, through the whim of simple proportional representation, to force the country into another election. But so be it. Never mind. We have one more chance, at the ballot box on June 25th, to send an even louder message and, why not, in Salamina, to reach 50%. That is the goal we must set. Why? Because nothing is over, because we who are now experienced in politics know that every election starts from the beginning. We know well, and you know well, that the ballot boxes on the morning of June 25th will be empty, they will have to be refilled. They will be filled with many New Democracy ballots, and when we count them on election night, there will be one big winner: New Democracy, which will guarantee the country's stable course of prosperity for the second four-year term.
