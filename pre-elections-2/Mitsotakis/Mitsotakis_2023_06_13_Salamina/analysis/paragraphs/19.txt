Because do not forget one thing: we, the party of Constantine Karamanlis, are the broad popular party that sees beyond colors and labels and unites all Greeks on the road to progress. Steadily and boldly, we are going for another great victory and we will win the bet here in Salamina to achieve even better percentages. Be well, thank you very much, good strength, good fight, and may we be victorious again. For the sake of Greece, we will write our own history together. Be well, thank you very much.
