But, friends, if we want to increase our percentages even more - and this is possible - we need to focus on the future in the last 10 days before the elections. We should talk about what we want to do in the next four years, our plan for an economy that will grow, better wages, and more jobs. We should also discuss how we will further support local government, especially with George Patoulis' presence. The Municipality of Salamina was the first to go bankrupt, and without government support, it would not have been able to recover financially. We should remember this because we are close to local government, and we know that small local problems must be solved with the help of the state by municipalities and regional governors.
