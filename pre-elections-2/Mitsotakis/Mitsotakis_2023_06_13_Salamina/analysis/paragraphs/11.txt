And, of course, we place a lot of emphasis on screening. For all the women who are with us, especially those over 50, you now know that for the first time, you have received a message from the Greek state about the possibility of free mammography in a public or private facility. Watch out for free mammography in a public or private facility. So far, we have identified almost 8,000 cases of breast cancer - these women did not know about it - at an early stage, with a very good chance of a complete cure. This is public health policy in practice. And because there has been a lot of fuss lately about cancer treatment issues - I think in our families, we have all gone through the great ordeal of having a relative with cancer - I just want to say two things. This government has implemented a very important program that has already started and is running, called "OIKOTHEN". What is the FAMILY program? To allow a cancer patient to have the opportunity to receive their treatment, their chemotherapy, at home. Rather than running to the "Metaxas" or "Tzaneio" Hospital, the doctor will come, and the nurse at home will administer the treatment. It is a great breakthrough for our fellow cancer patients.
