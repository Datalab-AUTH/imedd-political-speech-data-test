And one word, friends, because it is something that I hear all the time, about the second big priority for the next four years, which is to support the National Health System. You know that in the four years that we have been in government, we have managed many crises, perhaps the most difficult one was the pandemic crisis. The National Health System managed to stand up, but at the same time, because our priority was to deal with the pandemic, some of the important reforms that we had to implement inevitably fell behind. That is why the second four years will be a four-year period in which the National Health System will change its face. We will recruit 10,000 doctors and nurses over a four-year horizon. We are reforming the emergency departments of our hospitals. We are rebuilding from scratch almost all of the country's health centers; we are further supporting the institution of the Personal Doctor, which is taking its first steps for the first time so that we can have primary care before our fellow citizens have to go to the hospital.
