And for the next day, I can guarantee you one thing: if the citizens trust me again, I will be the Prime Minister of all Greeks, and my duty is to unite Greek society once again. We have never invested in division; we have only invested in unity. We want the country to progress as a whole, and the country will progress as a whole with a stable government of New Democracy, more experienced, more ready now to face the great challenges. You can be sure and confident that for Salamina and for the constituency of Piraeus II as a whole, and for all of Greece - and I believe what I am saying - the best days are ahead of us.
