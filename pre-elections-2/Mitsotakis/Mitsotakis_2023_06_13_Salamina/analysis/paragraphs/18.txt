Let me conclude my presence here in Salamina today with a heartwarming story that demonstrates our genuine concern for our vulnerable fellow citizens - those whom the Greek state has neglected for far too long. This story exemplifies who the true progressives are in our country. You may have come across a video featuring my friend, the star Kostas, who was in Piraeus, just across the street from here. Thanks to the efforts of some compassionate individuals, Kostas was able to secure a home and a job. This is the ultimate testament to New Democracy's commitment to supporting our most vulnerable citizens, helping them get back on their feet after a fall.
