And of course, let me repeat once again my commitment: there is no way that any cancer patient in our country who, if their doctor thinks so, cannot have access to the best possible treatment that science offers, free of charge. To put an end to all these false rumors about the supposed privatization of the National Health System and various other nonsense that I hear today from the desperate opposition, we will support the National Health System, the public and free healthcare system, and where necessary - please note, because this can also be done, it is already being done today, as we speak - this cooperation with the private sector will never be to the detriment of the insured. Services will be provided free of charge, whether we are talking about the National Health System or about services that the private sector can also provide in addition to the National Health System.
