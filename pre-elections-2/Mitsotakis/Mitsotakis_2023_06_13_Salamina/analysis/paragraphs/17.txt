We are at the beginning of a very positive cycle for our country, a cycle of prosperity. But I stress, prosperity with less inequality. A cycle in which the state will be able to return the wealth that the economy creates back to society with quality health, education, and security services, which is what you expect from the state. With a state that will be there for you in every difficulty and will support the weakest.
