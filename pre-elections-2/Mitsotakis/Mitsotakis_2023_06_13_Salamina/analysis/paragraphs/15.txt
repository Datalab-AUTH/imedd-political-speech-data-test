This was the major message of the May 21st elections. A government that emphasized efficiency was rewarded. They understood that citizens' problems have no color, and in our cooperation with local government, we never looked at how mayors voted. Any mayor who needed the support of the state received it because we know that we have to be helpful to local government. After all, problems do not have a color.
