Thank you for the warm welcome. Friends, Young Democrats of Salamina in the Piraeus Constituency B, I am here today, Madam President and Mr. Mayor, to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for the tremendous electoral success we achieved in Salamina. I wonder how many people could have predicted before the elections that we would increase our percentage by 8 points and reach almost 50% here in Salamina. I also wonder how many people would have been willing to bet before the elections that we would make a big turnaround and bring New Democracy into first place by a wide margin in the whole of the second district of Piraeus. Yet, we were able to achieve this impressive result, friends, because the citizens of Salamina and the electoral district of Piraeus II rewarded the important work that our government has done during these four years. They rewarded the return to growth, the solid policy on national issues, and the language of truth and pragmatism. They rejected division, toxicity, cynicism, and a return to the past. The ballot box of May 21 sent a message of hope, optimism, and unity.
