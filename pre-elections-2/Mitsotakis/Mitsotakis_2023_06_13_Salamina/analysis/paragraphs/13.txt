So, friends, all of this is what we need to talk about in the last 10 days before the elections. We need to explain why it is so important to have a secure and stable majority for New Democracy in the ballot box. I don't think anyone would want us to be in the uncomfortable position of either having a marginal majority after the next ballot box or being in the 148-149 MPs. And in that case, watch out for the other opposition parties, especially PASOK. What are they telling us? "You can have 149 MPs, I'm not interested in governing, I don't want to take on this responsibility, I'm staying in opposition." So we say to them, "Well, you'll do very well, except that citizens vote for government and not for opposition." Today, the only responsible force that is prepared to take over the governance of the country with a plan is New Democracy. All the others are competing over who will have the penthouse in the center-left block of flats.
