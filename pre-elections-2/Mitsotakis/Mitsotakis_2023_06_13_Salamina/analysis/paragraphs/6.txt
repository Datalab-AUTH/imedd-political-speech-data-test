As we are in Salamis, which is home to the largest naval station in the country, I want you to know that the three Belharra frigates, which are being built in French shipyards and will significantly strengthen our fleet, will find their place here in Salamis at the end of 2025. They will be located here in Salamina. Be aware, all of you, that the policy of strengthening the Armed Forces will continue. It will be continued by this government because a strong country, a confident country, must be able to defend its sovereignty and its sovereign rights. And in order to be able to play our role as a factor of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, my commitment and that of the government of the New Democracy is that the Armed Forces will continue to be strengthened from the surplus of the Greek taxpayer. Because that is what we must do when we are in a difficult neighborhood, with an intrusive and defiant neighbor.
