At the same time, however, the ballot box of May 21 sent a great message of responsibility to all of us, friends. The citizens have once again placed their trust in New Democracy, and we have achieved something that our party has never achieved before: to increase our percentages and the absolute number of votes from election to election while being in government. We had never achieved that since 1974. This is the first time we have achieved it. But why are we here today? Why are we having another election rally in the summer? For the simple reason that there is one more ballot box. We haven't finished the job. If the May 21 elections had been held under the electoral system that will be in place for the June 25 ballot, the country would already have a stable and strong government today. This is what the Greek people have chosen.
