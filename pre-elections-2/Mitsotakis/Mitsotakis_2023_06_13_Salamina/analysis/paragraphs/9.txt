At the same time, I will say a word to the grandparents. First of all, I want to talk about pensioners - because this is something I hear everywhere: the bill for the Katrougalos law was sent to the person who voted for it. Our obligation is to continue increasing pensions. With the New Democracy government, you can expect good annual increases in pensions. And for those who were affected by the personal differential, we will continue to support you until it is eliminated.
