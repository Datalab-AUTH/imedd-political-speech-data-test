Our adversary is complacency, the sense that the result has already been discounted. No outcome should be taken for granted. The ballot boxes will be empty on the morning of June 25th and they must be refilled with many New Democracy ballots. They will be filled with many New Democracy ballots and all of Greece will be blue again. This will be a vote of confidence in our party and in me personally. However, it will also increase the responsibility I have towards you to rise to the occasion and to exceed the high bar we have set.
