Do you know how difficult it is, my friends, for a party in power to increase both the absolute number of votes it receives and its percentages? And yet, we have succeeded. Not many people would have bet that it could happen, but we will do better, and we must do better in the June 25 election for one key reason. The next Parliament may have six or maybe seven parties. You all know by now that this means the bar for self-reliance is rising. So, if we want to have a stable and strong majority that allows us to implement our program, yes, we can and must increase our electoral quotas even more.
