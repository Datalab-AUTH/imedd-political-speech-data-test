I don't think there has ever been such a mass gathering at this time in Nea Ionia before, but that says something. It also says something about the expectations of the citizens. It says something about the great "blue wave" which is rising and which, on the evening of 25 June, will lead us to another great electoral victory. So let us go together, let us not lose a single vote. To the young people who have rallied with us, against the predictions that 'the youth have turned their backs on New Democracy', I ask them to first go and vote and then go to the beach. First, exercise our right and then we can all celebrate a great electoral victory for our party on the evening of 25 June. A great victory for our country, a great victory for our Greece. So let us go together for another great victory, for the Greece we envision, firmly, boldly and only forward for a self-reliant Greece. Be well. Thank you very much. Goodbye and with victory. Be well.
