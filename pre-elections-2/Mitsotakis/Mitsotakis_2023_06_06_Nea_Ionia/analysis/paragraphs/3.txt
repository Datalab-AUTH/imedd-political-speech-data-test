Because today, the country needs first and foremost a stable government that can lead our country safely into the future and face the major geopolitical challenges of the region. You see, Turkey already has a new, strong, and stable government. We need a stable government in our country too so that we can continue to defend our sovereignty, our sovereign rights, upgrade our geopolitical role, and continue to protect our borders effectively and fairly, both on land and at sea. This is the great challenge of the next elections, whether we will be able to continue on this path of recovery and modernization of the country.
