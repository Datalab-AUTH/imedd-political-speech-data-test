That is why the preservation of unity, the rejection of toxicity, and the emphasis on correct political discourse will distinguish our election campaign from now until the elections on June 25. I would like to ask all of our cadres - I see among us old traditional cadres who kept the party flag flying when we were very few in New Ionia, and I owe you a big thank you. But I also see many new cadres who rallied in 2019, some of whom are voting for us for the first time now. I say to them: trust us, we know where we want to lead the ship of Greece, and let's go together to give this fight so that not a single vote is lost at the polls on June 25.
