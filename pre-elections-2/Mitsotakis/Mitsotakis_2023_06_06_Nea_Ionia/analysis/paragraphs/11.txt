We have the wind in our sails, we look up, but our feet are on the ground. We are neither arrogant nor conceited. We leave those attitudes for others who suffer from the "micromagnanimity syndrome" because they managed to get a double-digit percentage by the skin of their teeth. They think they have achieved a great triumph; we have achieved a very high percentage, but we remain down to earth because we know that our opponent is the problems of the people. I also know very well that on the next day, the next electoral victory, I must, with your confidence, be the Prime Minister of all Greek women and all Greeks, not just those who voted for us.
