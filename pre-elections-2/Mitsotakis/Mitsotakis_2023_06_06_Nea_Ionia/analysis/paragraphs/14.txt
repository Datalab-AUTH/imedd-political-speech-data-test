We have achieved a lot. We can achieve much more. I firmly believe that, especially in the economy, the best days are ahead of us. Today, I walked here in the pedestrian street of Nea Ionia. There is no empty shop, and the shopkeepers now see their future with greater optimism. This does not mean that there are no problems. There are many problems that we have to deal with. But we have every right to believe that the best is ahead of us, and that together we can achieve it.
