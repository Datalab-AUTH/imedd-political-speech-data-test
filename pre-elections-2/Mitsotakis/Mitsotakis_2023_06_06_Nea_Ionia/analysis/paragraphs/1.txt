Good day from Blue New Ionia. Who would have thought that New Democracy would win in Nea Ionia by 10 points over SYRIZA? That is why I am here today to say a big thank you for the struggle we fought together and for the great victory we achieved on Sunday, May 21. Thank you for your love and support for our great party, New Democracy. It is also a special moment for me. I remember when I first started as a candidate for the unified Athens North. To my colleagues in the northern sector who sometimes complain that your constituency is too big, think about what it meant when we had to cover the whole of Athens North. But I remember when I came to Nea Ionia, we were much fewer. Now we are much more, and we will be even more on the evening of June 25 to complete the important step we took in the last poll on May 21.
