I cannot forget that I came to Nea Ionia - I had the opportunity to talk to the Mayor - on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the city. A city that has a deep history and roots in refugee Hellenism, which we honor and recognize. Look out, "you are and will be the Prime Minister". At this moment, I am not the Prime Minister. We have a caretaker Prime Minister. If you want me to be the Prime Minister again, you should all go and vote in the ballot box on June 25th. And there is one reason why I am not the Prime Minister today, and that is called "simple proportional representation". Because if the elections had been held under the system of enhanced proportional representation, today the country would already have a stable government with a comfortable parliamentary majority. So what some people did not allow us to do at the polls on May 21st because they experimented with simple proportional representation, I ask you to do twenty days from now, with a strong New Democracy, with a comfortable parliamentary majority.
