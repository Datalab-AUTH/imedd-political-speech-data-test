I have been watching the public debate over the last few days with interest, and it seems that the opposition is exhausting its political discourse by competing over who will impose the most taxes. We have proven that we can reduce taxes for every Greek - we have reduced 50 taxes - without jeopardizing the fiscal stability of the country. When an economy is growing, when a business is doing better, and when it has more profits, it can pay a lower tax rate. Ultimately, the revenue for the state will be higher.
