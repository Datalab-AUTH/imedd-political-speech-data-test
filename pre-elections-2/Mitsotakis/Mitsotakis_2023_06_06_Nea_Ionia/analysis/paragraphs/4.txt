The strong majority for a stable government that we are asking for is also a necessary condition, friends, so that we can put into practice the great changes that we have already spoken to you about and for which we have already obtained the positive vote of the Greek people.Because if anything was vindicated in the previous election period, it was the correct political discourse, the emphasis on the programme and the rejection of toxic political discourse, of divisive political discourse, of lies, of "black Greece".Black Greece was defeated in the elections of 21 May, but "bright Greece" won. The divisiveness was defeated, unity won. And the party that managed to convince the majority of citizens that it has a real plan for how we envision Greece in the next four years, with an emphasis on stable and sustainable growth, with more jobs, more investment and a stronger welfare state.
