This is the big issue of the next elections, friends: whether we will continue to move forward on the path we have started to chart or whether we will go back to a period of prolonged instability with governments that cannot have the strong parliamentary legitimacy to make the big changes. I have never hidden, friends, that I do not seek to be a mere administrator of power. I want to make the big changes together and for our country to finally be able to change course. In this great effort that we started four years ago, I want you to be my fellow travelers. And for me, it is extremely encouraging that fellow citizens who had never voted for us before joined forces with New Democracy in these elections that have just passed us by.
