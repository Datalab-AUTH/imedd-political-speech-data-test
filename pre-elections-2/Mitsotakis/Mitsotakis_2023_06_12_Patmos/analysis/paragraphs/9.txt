This is the challenge of securing a prosperous Greece that we must win. To achieve this, we need your support in the elections on June 25th. I am confident that I will have your support, not only here in Patmos and throughout the Dodecanese, but also across all of Greece. The citizens have drawn their conclusions, and I believe that Greek society demonstrated great maturity in the May 21st election. They rejected lies, division, darkness, and toxicity, and instead voted for progress, development, decency, and political discourse based on sound arguments.
