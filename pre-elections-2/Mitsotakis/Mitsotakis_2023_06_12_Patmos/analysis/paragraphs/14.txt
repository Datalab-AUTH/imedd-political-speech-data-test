So, my friends, I want to say a big thank you once again. I want to ask you something special here. We have new voters with us, kids who voted for the first time. So I asked them - yes, this is interesting - "What do you guys want?" They said to me, "a gym." Because I'm not just here to talk, I'm here to listen to your demands. Well, your requests will be considered, Mr. District Governor, and we will respond. Do you know why? Because we want young people. I was in Arkansas before. In Arkioi, as you know, there is a student, a teacher - look, she came from Florina, a young girl came from Florina - who even asked me to stay in Arkioi next year so that we can have a school with the Greek flag and a student. And I hope that there will be two and three and more children here. So that you can enjoy the beauties of this place without feeling that you don't have access to the same sports facilities, your request is recorded and we will do something, my Mayor, for the sports facilities on the island.
