So we still have a lot of work to do. But if we are to roll up our sleeves and start working on June 26th, the ballot boxes must be refilled with many blue ballots on June 25th. 2.4 million of our fellow citizens have put their trust in us. We can increase that number even more. We will go to the polls in June with the air of a winner, but not with the arrogance that often accompanies a winner who scores a big score. I am here on the island of Revelation, and the result was a revelation. It was certainly a revelation for those who saw Greece as 'black' and saw everything going from bad to worse because that was the image that the opposition presented of the state of our country. We were saying, 'look, the glass is half full, not half empty.' We have taken many important steps in this four-year period. Especially those of you who are close to Turkey know how much safer you feel today with the New Democracy government.
