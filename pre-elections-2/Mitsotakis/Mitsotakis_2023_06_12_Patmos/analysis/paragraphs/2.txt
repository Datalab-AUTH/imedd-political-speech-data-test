You know my love for the Dodecanese, especially for the smaller islands. At this point, I would like to say a special thank you to an amazing Regional Governor, George Hadjimarkos, with whom we have excellent cooperation, just as we have excellent cooperation with your Mayor. Together, we can solve many small and big problems. The truth is that we have direct communication with George Hadjimarkos. He has the comfort to send me frequent messages with small problems that plague you. But if there is one thing - I believe - that we have proven over these four years, it is that there is no problem that is "small" enough that we do not want to deal with because what may be small for us is big for you. And I believe that the results of our policy are the ones that were finally rewarded at the ballot box on 21 May. I think you are also experiencing them here in Patmos, with tourist traffic that is going from good to better, with new investments being made, with more jobs, with better wages.
