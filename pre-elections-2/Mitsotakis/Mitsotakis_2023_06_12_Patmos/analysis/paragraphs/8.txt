And of course, only a strong Greece with strong Armed Forces, strong alliances, and a strong economy can actually negotiate with Turkey on the major dispute, which is none other than the delimitation of maritime zones, EEZ, and continental shelf in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. You know better than I do that we have nothing to divide with the Turkish people. We were the first to rush to their aid in the devastating earthquake. The men and women of the EMAK were the first to be there with the Greek flag to rescue people trapped in the rubble. We seek to have a good relationship, but always with caution, without making any discount to our sovereignty and our sovereign rights.
