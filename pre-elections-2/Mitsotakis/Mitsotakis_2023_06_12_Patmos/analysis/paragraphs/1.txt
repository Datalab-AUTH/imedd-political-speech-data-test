Mr. Mayor, Mr. Regional Governor, and friends, first of all, thank you for this very warm welcome. I apologize for the short delay. I made you wait in the sun, but we started a very beautiful tour this morning from Leros, then we went to Lipsi and Arki. I am here with you today in Patmos, first and foremost, to say a big thank you for supporting New Democracy at the polls on May 21st. Here in the Dodecanese, we achieved unprecedented figures for our party, and I ask you to make a bet with me because when you set the bar high, you have to set it even higher. Let's go now and see our percentage "5" on the front exceed 50% in the Dodecanese. We have achieved something unique. All of Greece was blue, all of Greece will remain blue, and citizens will once again trust New Democracy to hold the fate of the country in its hands for the next four years.
