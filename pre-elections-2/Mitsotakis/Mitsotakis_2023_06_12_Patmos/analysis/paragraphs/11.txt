So we have managed to win the trust of the citizens precisely because we have worked hard with a program, and we have made Greece a better country. We are not where we want to be yet. I want to stress this; we still have a lot of work to do. You know very well that for four years we have had to deal with many major crises at the same time. Think how much more we can do for our country if we have a four-year period of calmer waters ahead of us. But, in any case, I do not want to bore you any longer because here we are in the sun, and you have already waited a long time.
