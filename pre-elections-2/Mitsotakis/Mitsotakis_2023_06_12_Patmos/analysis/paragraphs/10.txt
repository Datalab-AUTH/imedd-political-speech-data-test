We do not want to fight, nor do we want to get into debates that ultimately do not interest the citizens. Problems, you know, have no color. If you have a shortage here at your health center and you're short a doctor, we have to come in and solve the problem, and that's not a blue problem, that's not a red problem, that's not a green problem.
