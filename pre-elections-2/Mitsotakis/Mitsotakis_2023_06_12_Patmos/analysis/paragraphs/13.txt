If we have achieved anything with our policy, it is to distribute the wealth that we create fairly. However, our first concern is to support the weakest. We are a people's party that stands for social cohesion and wants less inequality in society. At the same time, we know that if you do not create wealth, then you cannot have a discussion about how to distribute it. You have to create it first and then see how to distribute it.
