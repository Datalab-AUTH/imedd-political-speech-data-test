Young Democrats, fellow citizens of Thessaloniki, and proud Macedonians, thank you for this impressive reception, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Regional Governor. Thank you, first and foremost, for the impressive victory that you gave to New Democracy on May 21st here in my new constituency, in the first district of Thessaloniki, but also throughout Macedonia. I must tell you that today I feel moved and honored to speak under the monument to Alexander the Great. A big thank you to our ONNED and the ONNEDites, who always give their own special touch to all our gatherings. We older people remember that Aristotelous Square and the beach of Thessaloniki have hosted historic gatherings of our party, first with its founder Konstantinos Karamanlis, later with Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Kostas Karamanlis, and Antonis Samaras. It may have been a different era, but the passion for the homeland and progress always remains the same. You have already proved it in the first ballot. A big thank you to the 2.4 million Greeks who trusted us.

On May 21, citizens rewarded our work by saying "yes" to truth, "yes" to unity, and "yes" to the decency of political discourse. They also punished those who invested in division, lies, blackness, and toxicity. The citizens' reward in May was strong, but there is a demand to move faster and more boldly on the path of great changes and reforms that our country needs. We are all here today, in this beautiful gathering, to send a message: to make victory a reality, it must be repeated even more strongly this coming Sunday.

Because, mind you, nothing has been decided yet. We have taken a big step indeed. However, this step will be as if it had never happened if it is not consolidated and then immediately followed by a leap for the whole country on 26 June. You have heard me say it many times: on the morning of 25 June, the polls will be empty again. If we are to have a stable and strong government on 26 June, they must once again be filled, flooded with millions of ballots from our party. Only then will the next day bring certainty to the country. And only in this way will the only political force that has shown that it can overcome crises, while at the same time implementing all its commitments to the citizens, finally hold the helm. This is a double bet, especially here in the first and second regions of Thessaloniki, where our percentages still have a lot of room for growth.

It is your duty, therefore, to come not only first, but first and by a wide margin, here in Thessaloniki. In other words, the time has come to put things in their place and to put this city in the position it deserves: a bastion of national tradition and at the same time a beacon of constant evolution. Thessaloniki is the impregnable castle of a self-reliant and all-powerful Greece. We are, after all, in a place that knows how to discern critical necessities every time. The Macedonians, like all Greeks, have overcome the trap of the simple logic of simple proportional representation. I am sure that with the same maturity, a few days from now, they will weigh the weight of their new vote, knowing that it will provide security in our daily lives tomorrow and that it will also boost optimism for a better life.

Friends, as you know well, the arithmetic of the ballot box is inexorable. Many extreme voices in Parliament do not necessarily mean a plurality but perhaps the opposite, leading to a democratic "cacophony", a brake on results and creation, and a danger of ungovernability. These are adventures that our country has lived through and now wants to leave behind once and for all. All the more so when they are expressed by neophyte "leaders", personalities who ultimately distort the ideas they invoke. The hijacking of values, in fact, is the common denominator of these movements, whether it is a question of alleged philanthropy or the monopoly of orthodoxy. These are quantities that unite, not divide. Orthodoxy is too great to be imprisoned in slogans; so those whose behavior ultimately offends the cross or the blue and white, let them hear it well: enough with the demek believers and the demek patriots. The former even go so far as to trade in religion. Where? Here, in the city - the pride of Byzantium. While others dare to monopolize the national consciousness. To you, the Macedonians in the front line. And when do they say it? Today, I am reminded, exactly 110 years to the day since the battle of Kilkis - Lachanas, I am here to talk about the patriotism of responsibility.

I am here, constantly present on all fronts: at the borders, in the Aegean, in the Armed Forces, and with a strong diplomatic voice in every international step. Greeks do not see this patriotism as a cheap currency that is redeemed in elections, but as a deep feeling that is tested in deeds and behavior. They recognize in us, the New Democracy, that we have made our country stronger and safer through deeds and not empty words. And I will say it again: on May 21, we voted to win together, but on June 25, we are voting to govern together.

On May 21, we implemented a policy that reduced 50 taxes, increased income and pensions, and created 300,000 new jobs. We are currently planning to improve wages for all, provide better public healthcare, and create a more efficient state that serves everyone. These goals are particularly important in achieving the much-needed investment grade. I have spoken extensively about this important milestone, which will make lending to businesses and households more favorable.

But, you know, there will be no shortage of dangerous challenges in the next four years. Immigration, as you saw, is bubbling up again. An unpredictable Turkey is also a concern, as they now have stable leadership and are our neighbor. The Greek response should be a choice of national certainty and progress, guided by the credibility and trust that we have established. Just as we did what we said in our first term, we will implement our plans for tomorrow. This is my commitment. We will continue to be transparent about our mistakes and weaknesses, but with greater experience and momentum. Our momentum will grow as your mandate grows stronger. That is why I insist that an independent New Democracy is the only road that ultimately leads to a strong Greece.

Friends and colleagues of New Democracy in Thessaloniki, together we have experienced and overcome many crises over the past four years. These include migratory invasions in Evros, an almost three-year-long pandemic, an international energy crisis, and daily national issues. You have seen that the state not only kept society and the economy afloat but also delivered on all its promises, protecting our national defense like never before, relieving taxpayers of an annual burden of 7 billion, reducing unemployment by almost 7 points, always supporting the weakest, and accelerating pension payments. When we came into government, it took two to four years to receive a pension. Today, pensions are coming out in two to three months, and this is a success of New Democracy. We are the ones who have given significant increases to pensioners for the first time. Our government has accompanied these 8 percent increases with an explicit commitment to address the tragedy of the personal differential. I am here to assure pensioners who did not see an increase because of the personal differential that they will have the support of the state until the personal differential is finally erased.

The ballot box of May 21 showed that all social and demographic groups are aligning with us. Our young people see that only quality education and training lead to a secure profession, and they voted for New Democracy against all predictions. The unemployed supported us because they realized that only investment opens up new jobs. Wage earners are realizing that collective growth brings increases. Professionals are realizing that less taxes mean more revenue. Our farmers are finding that tax cuts and incentives to modernize production support their income. With unprecedented maturity, the Greeks are calling on us to move forward as our motto says: "firmly, boldly, and only forward." To answer this call, we must all go to the polls on June 25, and the message from the ballot box must be loud and clear.

As the very difficult times are now behind us, as I hope, it is time to roll up our sleeves for the four years we want. I wonder how many people would have bet before May 21st that all of Greece would be blue. And yet we did. Now it's time to repay the citizens' trust in this blue country by implementing the program of a productive, social, fair, digital, and always strong Greece. This is the costed plan that we have been discussing again these weeks. I went back to Greece town by town, village by village, to carry the message that we can do better, that we deserve better, and that we can achieve these goals that we have in our program.

We have summarized them into four key objectives: Better wages, first and foremost, are my central commitment. I know that wages in our country are still low, especially for young people entering the labor market. They must finally come close to the European average. Decent healthcare is the second priority. After three years of the pandemic, it is time to build the new NHS. An efficient state, digital, but also friendly; and of course, a consistently proud homeland.

I will briefly describe the objectives. The first objective, as previously stated, is to improve pay. Within four years, the average private sector salary will reach 1,500 euros and the basic salary will be 950 euros. Civil servants will see their first increases in 2024, with an emphasis on those with children, as we are the party that supports the Greek family. This is why we are introducing an additional 1,000 euro tax-free allowance for families with children. We will also reduce the presumption of living expenses and further reduce social security contributions. As tax compliance improves, we will abolish the business tax.

The second health objective. You have heard me speak many times about the need to upgrade emergency departments. One hundred and fifty-six health centres will be rebuilt. And, most importantly, to drastically reduce waiting times, whether we're talking about emergencies or regular surgeries. Yes, we're going to recruit 10,000 health workers, including doctors and nurses, 1,000 of whom will be in the ED. They will also be reinforced with personnel from the armed forces and the fire brigade, and there will be six helicopter bases for air ambulance services. I am placing great emphasis on preventive screening, which will be extended for all major diseases.

Third objective: A state - as we have shown it can do - should stand alongside the most vulnerable. The minimum guaranteed income should increase, and 2,000 of our disabled citizens should finally have a personal assistant. The state officials should be constantly evaluated so that they can be rewarded for their performance. Our ultimate goal is a better public service, not just with billions of electronic transactions but with everyday professional and human behaviors.

And our fourth objective, of course, is non-negotiable for our party: a strong Greece. This means that the Evros fence is ending, whether some people want it or not. The arms programs will continue with the Rafale, the Belharra frigates, and the first F-35s in our Air Force in 2028. Major energy investments will also continue, as well as all our diplomatic initiatives in all international fields. It is time to separate the so-called patriots of hollow words from the true patriots of action.

Under the umbrella of these four priorities, the development plans for each region are promoted. For example, here in Central Macedonia, the most beautiful Metro in Europe, which will soon be operating normally, not with painted booths and stationary cars, is promoted by Mr. Regional Governor and Mr. Mayor. It will have fast and silent trains - victory always begins in Thessaloniki, as older people remember - and will be in a unique environment that highlights the treasures of the city. This project also records history and reflects our overall perception of the city's development. On the one hand, it showcases the routes from Alexander the Great to Hellenistic times, the Roman period, and Byzantium. On the other hand, it combines history and tradition with the daily routes that will change the face of the city and push it towards a modern era. For us, there is no continuity in the place without tradition, nor is there development without respect for our historical continuity.

You also know that the Flyover is entering the final stretch. Other interventions are also progressing: the new pier at the port, the redevelopment of the Thessaloniki International Fair, the Holocaust Museum, green spaces at the Ziakas and Melas camps. Especially for health and for the 14 hospitals of the Region, everything is being modernized and the city finally has two new hospitals: the new Pediatric and the new Anti-Cancer Hospital, the new "Theagenio", in the Karatasios camp. This is a picture of the future of Thessaloniki and Macedonia that your country has owed for decades.

However, my friends, I am here once again in Thessaloniki for my final election rally in Macedonia. My main goal is to emphasize the importance of this upcoming election. In May, we have the opportunity to reject lies and division and instead choose truth, realism, and honesty. Mistakes can only be addressed when they are acknowledged. However, these are just words. They will only become actions when we cast our votes. Our biggest enemy is complacency and arrogance. I will not allow it. As citizens place more responsibility on our shoulders, we have a greater obligation to be humble, to stand firm, to listen to society, and to work even harder to solve their problems.

So I will not cease to argue that on June 26, the country needs not only a stable government, but first and foremost a government capable of implementing its plan. That is why I say that self-reliance is not a party expedient. It is a national necessity today. After all, we know very well that only large majorities of citizens can ultimately become the waves of the great changes that the country needs. It is not, therefore, a blank cheque, as some people are proclaiming, but, as I said, a heavy mandate. It is a mandate of debt and a mandate to work. I repeat that in democracies strong governments are not the same as unaccountable governments. We have had leaders with high percentages in the past, but no one has ever presented them as a threat. We also had four years of an independent New Democracy. Yet, during this term, 423 laws were passed, 718 debates were held in Parliament, and 24 debates at the level of leaders. Only the Greek people are all-powerful. They will ultimately determine the parliamentary balance.

What is true, however, is that in an uncertain environment, the country needs certain solutions. A government that will not depend on fragile balances, nor will it be immune to pressures, party bargaining, and compromises, but will ultimately draw strength from the citizens themselves in order to achieve what they elected it to do. Therefore, for the country to have a clear horizon in its course, it must have a clear solution in its leadership. And that will be judged only by your vote. That is why you see that I have chosen not to speak practically at all about our opponents. Mr Tsipras himself admitted his failure, after all, by declaring "mea culpa"; but he continues to copy his bad self. In the recent shipwreck, he forgets that it took place in international waters, he forgets to say a single word about the fact that it was organized by criminal traffickers. And he again turns his fire against whom? Against his country, against the Coast Guard, which saved more than 100 lives, while at the same time giving Turkey arguments to use against Greece. And then they wonder why we call them a national exception.

While I will never tire of refuting the lies that are told and retold about supposed privatization, sometimes of healthcare, sometimes of water. Wasn't there a big concert next door in Aristotelous Square against the "privatization of water"? Those who organized it forget that SYRIZA put EYDAP and EYATH in the Hyperfund. But a month after the elections, these two companies are coming under the control of the State to end once and for all this "candy" about the alleged privatization of water.

Of course, Androulakis, who is unable to bear any burden of responsibility, tells us that "even if the first party has 149 MPs," he will remain in opposition. In other words, he wants to become - what is he telling us? - SYRIZA in place of SYRIZA, even risking third elections in August. I wonder if this is what the friends of PASOK really want. However, on Sunday, we do not vote for the third or second in the Parliament. We are not voting for opposition; we are voting for government. So let those who hesitated in May think about this, but I believe that now their conscience is calling them to join us. I say it again: no one is superfluous. All the more so, our fellow citizens with the same values as us, who are now besieged by voices that abuse those values, whether by representatives of criminals with blood on their hands, or by faux-patriotic newcomers, or by leaders who invoke the faith of love but with words of hatred. We must not let all of them become foci of permanent discord.

A message to the citizens, especially those in northern Greece: We do not give our vote lightly. No experiments with the future of the country at the ballot box on June 25th. I want every Greek who asks for certainty and a plan, who asks for stability and efficiency, who believes in the patriotism of responsibility, in the modernization of creation, without party blinkers. So, if on Sunday all these votes of responsibility unite, on Monday the blue ballot paper will be transformed into a colorful hope. And the burden for this now rests in your hands, in your strength. Thessaloniki, after all, as you well know, has always been a crossroads linking the West with the East. It is time for it to become a protagonist in a Greece that will be the envy of all Europe. After all, its liberation essentially marked the beginning of national integration in the 20th century. Now it is time for its own development to lead victoriously into the third decade of the 21st century. In other words, Macedonia ahead means the homeland ahead. And on this exciting journey, I ask you to travel side by side. Let us go. Struggle until the last moment before the ballot box, with our eyes up, with our minds, our hearts, our arms open. United as never before, with a single slogan: on Sunday we weigh and decide, on June 25th we vote, on June 26th we roll up our sleeves, we continue to build the new Greece that will move firmly, boldly, and only forward.
