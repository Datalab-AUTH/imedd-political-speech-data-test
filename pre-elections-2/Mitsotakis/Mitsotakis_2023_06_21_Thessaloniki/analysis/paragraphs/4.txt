It is your duty, therefore, to come not only first, but first and by a wide margin, here in Thessaloniki. In other words, the time has come to put things in their place and to put this city in the position it deserves: a bastion of national tradition and at the same time a beacon of constant evolution. Thessaloniki is the impregnable castle of a self-reliant and all-powerful Greece. We are, after all, in a place that knows how to discern critical necessities every time. The Macedonians, like all Greeks, have overcome the trap of the simple logic of simple proportional representation. I am sure that with the same maturity, a few days from now, they will weigh the weight of their new vote, knowing that it will provide security in our daily lives tomorrow and that it will also boost optimism for a better life.
