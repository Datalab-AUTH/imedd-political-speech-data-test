A message to the citizens, especially those in northern Greece: We do not give our vote lightly. No experiments with the future of the country at the ballot box on June 25th. I want every Greek who asks for certainty and a plan, who asks for stability and efficiency, who believes in the patriotism of responsibility, in the modernization of creation, without party blinkers. So, if on Sunday all these votes of responsibility unite, on Monday the blue ballot paper will be transformed into a colorful hope. And the burden for this now rests in your hands, in your strength. Thessaloniki, after all, as you well know, has always been a crossroads linking the West with the East. It is time for it to become a protagonist in a Greece that will be the envy of all Europe. After all, its liberation essentially marked the beginning of national integration in the 20th century. Now it is time for its own development to lead victoriously into the third decade of the 21st century. In other words, Macedonia ahead means the homeland ahead. And on this exciting journey, I ask you to travel side by side. Let us go. Struggle until the last moment before the ballot box, with our eyes up, with our minds, our hearts, our arms open. United as never before, with a single slogan: on Sunday we weigh and decide, on June 25th we vote, on June 26th we roll up our sleeves, we continue to build the new Greece that will move firmly, boldly, and only forward.
