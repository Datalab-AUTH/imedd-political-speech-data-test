On May 21, we implemented a policy that reduced 50 taxes, increased income and pensions, and created 300,000 new jobs. We are currently planning to improve wages for all, provide better public healthcare, and create a more efficient state that serves everyone. These goals are particularly important in achieving the much-needed investment grade. I have spoken extensively about this important milestone, which will make lending to businesses and households more favorable.
