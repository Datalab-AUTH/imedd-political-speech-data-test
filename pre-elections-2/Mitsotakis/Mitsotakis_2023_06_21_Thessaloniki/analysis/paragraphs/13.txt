I will briefly describe the objectives. The first objective, as previously stated, is to improve pay. Within four years, the average private sector salary will reach 1,500 euros and the basic salary will be 950 euros. Civil servants will see their first increases in 2024, with an emphasis on those with children, as we are the party that supports the Greek family. This is why we are introducing an additional 1,000 euro tax-free allowance for families with children. We will also reduce the presumption of living expenses and further reduce social security contributions. As tax compliance improves, we will abolish the business tax.
