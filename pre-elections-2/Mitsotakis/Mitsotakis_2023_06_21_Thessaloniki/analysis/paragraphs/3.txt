Because, mind you, nothing has been decided yet. We have taken a big step indeed. However, this step will be as if it had never happened if it is not consolidated and then immediately followed by a leap for the whole country on 26 June. You have heard me say it many times: on the morning of 25 June, the polls will be empty again. If we are to have a stable and strong government on 26 June, they must once again be filled, flooded with millions of ballots from our party. Only then will the next day bring certainty to the country. And only in this way will the only political force that has shown that it can overcome crises, while at the same time implementing all its commitments to the citizens, finally hold the helm. This is a double bet, especially here in the first and second regions of Thessaloniki, where our percentages still have a lot of room for growth.
