Under the umbrella of these four priorities, the development plans for each region are promoted. For example, here in Central Macedonia, the most beautiful Metro in Europe, which will soon be operating normally, not with painted booths and stationary cars, is promoted by Mr. Regional Governor and Mr. Mayor. It will have fast and silent trains - victory always begins in Thessaloniki, as older people remember - and will be in a unique environment that highlights the treasures of the city. This project also records history and reflects our overall perception of the city's development. On the one hand, it showcases the routes from Alexander the Great to Hellenistic times, the Roman period, and Byzantium. On the other hand, it combines history and tradition with the daily routes that will change the face of the city and push it towards a modern era. For us, there is no continuity in the place without tradition, nor is there development without respect for our historical continuity.
