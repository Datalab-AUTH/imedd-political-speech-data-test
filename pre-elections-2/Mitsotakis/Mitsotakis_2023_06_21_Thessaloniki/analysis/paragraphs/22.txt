While I will never tire of refuting the lies that are told and retold about supposed privatization, sometimes of healthcare, sometimes of water. Wasn't there a big concert next door in Aristotelous Square against the "privatization of water"? Those who organized it forget that SYRIZA put EYDAP and EYATH in the Hyperfund. But a month after the elections, these two companies are coming under the control of the State to end once and for all this "candy" about the alleged privatization of water.
