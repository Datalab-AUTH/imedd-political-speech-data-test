Friends, as you know well, the arithmetic of the ballot box is inexorable. Many extreme voices in Parliament do not necessarily mean a plurality but perhaps the opposite, leading to a democratic "cacophony", a brake on results and creation, and a danger of ungovernability. These are adventures that our country has lived through and now wants to leave behind once and for all. All the more so when they are expressed by neophyte "leaders", personalities who ultimately distort the ideas they invoke. The hijacking of values, in fact, is the common denominator of these movements, whether it is a question of alleged philanthropy or the monopoly of orthodoxy. These are quantities that unite, not divide. Orthodoxy is too great to be imprisoned in slogans; so those whose behavior ultimately offends the cross or the blue and white, let them hear it well: enough with the demek believers and the demek patriots. The former even go so far as to trade in religion. Where? Here, in the city - the pride of Byzantium. While others dare to monopolize the national consciousness. To you, the Macedonians in the front line. And when do they say it? Today, I am reminded, exactly 110 years to the day since the battle of Kilkis - Lachanas, I am here to talk about the patriotism of responsibility.
