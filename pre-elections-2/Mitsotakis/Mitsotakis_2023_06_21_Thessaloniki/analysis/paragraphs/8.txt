But, you know, there will be no shortage of dangerous challenges in the next four years. Immigration, as you saw, is bubbling up again. An unpredictable Turkey is also a concern, as they now have stable leadership and are our neighbor. The Greek response should be a choice of national certainty and progress, guided by the credibility and trust that we have established. Just as we did what we said in our first term, we will implement our plans for tomorrow. This is my commitment. We will continue to be transparent about our mistakes and weaknesses, but with greater experience and momentum. Our momentum will grow as your mandate grows stronger. That is why I insist that an independent New Democracy is the only road that ultimately leads to a strong Greece.
