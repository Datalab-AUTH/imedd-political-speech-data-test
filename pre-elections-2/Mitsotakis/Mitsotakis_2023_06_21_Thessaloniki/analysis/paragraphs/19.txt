However, my friends, I am here once again in Thessaloniki for my final election rally in Macedonia. My main goal is to emphasize the importance of this upcoming election. In May, we have the opportunity to reject lies and division and instead choose truth, realism, and honesty. Mistakes can only be addressed when they are acknowledged. However, these are just words. They will only become actions when we cast our votes. Our biggest enemy is complacency and arrogance. I will not allow it. As citizens place more responsibility on our shoulders, we have a greater obligation to be humble, to stand firm, to listen to society, and to work even harder to solve their problems.
