The second health objective. You have heard me speak many times about the need to upgrade emergency departments. One hundred and fifty-six health centres will be rebuilt. And, most importantly, to drastically reduce waiting times, whether we're talking about emergencies or regular surgeries. Yes, we're going to recruit 10,000 health workers, including doctors and nurses, 1,000 of whom will be in the ED. They will also be reinforced with personnel from the armed forces and the fire brigade, and there will be six helicopter bases for air ambulance services. I am placing great emphasis on preventive screening, which will be extended for all major diseases.
