Of course, Androulakis, who is unable to bear any burden of responsibility, tells us that "even if the first party has 149 MPs," he will remain in opposition. In other words, he wants to become - what is he telling us? - SYRIZA in place of SYRIZA, even risking third elections in August. I wonder if this is what the friends of PASOK really want. However, on Sunday, we do not vote for the third or second in the Parliament. We are not voting for opposition; we are voting for government. So let those who hesitated in May think about this, but I believe that now their conscience is calling them to join us. I say it again: no one is superfluous. All the more so, our fellow citizens with the same values as us, who are now besieged by voices that abuse those values, whether by representatives of criminals with blood on their hands, or by faux-patriotic newcomers, or by leaders who invoke the faith of love but with words of hatred. We must not let all of them become foci of permanent discord.
