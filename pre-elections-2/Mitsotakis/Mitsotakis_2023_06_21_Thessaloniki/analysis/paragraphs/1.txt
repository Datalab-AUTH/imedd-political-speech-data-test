Young Democrats, fellow citizens of Thessaloniki, and proud Macedonians, thank you for this impressive reception, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Regional Governor. Thank you, first and foremost, for the impressive victory that you gave to New Democracy on May 21st here in my new constituency, in the first district of Thessaloniki, but also throughout Macedonia. I must tell you that today I feel moved and honored to speak under the monument to Alexander the Great. A big thank you to our ONNED and the ONNEDites, who always give their own special touch to all our gatherings. We older people remember that Aristotelous Square and the beach of Thessaloniki have hosted historic gatherings of our party, first with its founder Konstantinos Karamanlis, later with Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Kostas Karamanlis, and Antonis Samaras. It may have been a different era, but the passion for the homeland and progress always remains the same. You have already proved it in the first ballot. A big thank you to the 2.4 million Greeks who trusted us.
