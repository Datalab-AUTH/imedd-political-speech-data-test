As the very difficult times are now behind us, as I hope, it is time to roll up our sleeves for the four years we want. I wonder how many people would have bet before May 21st that all of Greece would be blue. And yet we did. Now it's time to repay the citizens' trust in this blue country by implementing the program of a productive, social, fair, digital, and always strong Greece. This is the costed plan that we have been discussing again these weeks. I went back to Greece town by town, village by village, to carry the message that we can do better, that we deserve better, and that we can achieve these goals that we have in our program.
