Third objective: A state - as we have shown it can do - should stand alongside the most vulnerable. The minimum guaranteed income should increase, and 2,000 of our disabled citizens should finally have a personal assistant. The state officials should be constantly evaluated so that they can be rewarded for their performance. Our ultimate goal is a better public service, not just with billions of electronic transactions but with everyday professional and human behaviors.
