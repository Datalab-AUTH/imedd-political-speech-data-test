The ballot box of May 21 showed that all social and demographic groups are aligning with us. Our young people see that only quality education and training lead to a secure profession, and they voted for New Democracy against all predictions. The unemployed supported us because they realized that only investment opens up new jobs. Wage earners are realizing that collective growth brings increases. Professionals are realizing that less taxes mean more revenue. Our farmers are finding that tax cuts and incentives to modernize production support their income. With unprecedented maturity, the Greeks are calling on us to move forward as our motto says: "firmly, boldly, and only forward." To answer this call, we must all go to the polls on June 25, and the message from the ballot box must be loud and clear.
