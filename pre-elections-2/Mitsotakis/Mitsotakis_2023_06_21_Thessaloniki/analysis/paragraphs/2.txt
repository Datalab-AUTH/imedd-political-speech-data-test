On May 21, citizens rewarded our work by saying "yes" to truth, "yes" to unity, and "yes" to the decency of political discourse. They also punished those who invested in division, lies, blackness, and toxicity. The citizens' reward in May was strong, but there is a demand to move faster and more boldly on the path of great changes and reforms that our country needs. We are all here today, in this beautiful gathering, to send a message: to make victory a reality, it must be repeated even more strongly this coming Sunday.
