So I will not cease to argue that on June 26, the country needs not only a stable government, but first and foremost a government capable of implementing its plan. That is why I say that self-reliance is not a party expedient. It is a national necessity today. After all, we know very well that only large majorities of citizens can ultimately become the waves of the great changes that the country needs. It is not, therefore, a blank cheque, as some people are proclaiming, but, as I said, a heavy mandate. It is a mandate of debt and a mandate to work. I repeat that in democracies strong governments are not the same as unaccountable governments. We have had leaders with high percentages in the past, but no one has ever presented them as a threat. We also had four years of an independent New Democracy. Yet, during this term, 423 laws were passed, 718 debates were held in Parliament, and 24 debates at the level of leaders. Only the Greek people are all-powerful. They will ultimately determine the parliamentary balance.
