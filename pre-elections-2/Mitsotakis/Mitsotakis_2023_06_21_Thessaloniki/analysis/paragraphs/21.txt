What is true, however, is that in an uncertain environment, the country needs certain solutions. A government that will not depend on fragile balances, nor will it be immune to pressures, party bargaining, and compromises, but will ultimately draw strength from the citizens themselves in order to achieve what they elected it to do. Therefore, for the country to have a clear horizon in its course, it must have a clear solution in its leadership. And that will be judged only by your vote. That is why you see that I have chosen not to speak practically at all about our opponents. Mr Tsipras himself admitted his failure, after all, by declaring "mea culpa"; but he continues to copy his bad self. In the recent shipwreck, he forgets that it took place in international waters, he forgets to say a single word about the fact that it was organized by criminal traffickers. And he again turns his fire against whom? Against his country, against the Coast Guard, which saved more than 100 lives, while at the same time giving Turkey arguments to use against Greece. And then they wonder why we call them a national exception.
