I am here, constantly present on all fronts: at the borders, in the Aegean, in the Armed Forces, and with a strong diplomatic voice in every international step. Greeks do not see this patriotism as a cheap currency that is redeemed in elections, but as a deep feeling that is tested in deeds and behavior. They recognize in us, the New Democracy, that we have made our country stronger and safer through deeds and not empty words. And I will say it again: on May 21, we voted to win together, but on June 25, we are voting to govern together.
