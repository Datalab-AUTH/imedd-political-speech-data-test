Friends and colleagues of New Democracy in Thessaloniki, together we have experienced and overcome many crises over the past four years. These include migratory invasions in Evros, an almost three-year-long pandemic, an international energy crisis, and daily national issues. You have seen that the state not only kept society and the economy afloat but also delivered on all its promises, protecting our national defense like never before, relieving taxpayers of an annual burden of 7 billion, reducing unemployment by almost 7 points, always supporting the weakest, and accelerating pension payments. When we came into government, it took two to four years to receive a pension. Today, pensions are coming out in two to three months, and this is a success of New Democracy. We are the ones who have given significant increases to pensioners for the first time. Our government has accompanied these 8 percent increases with an explicit commitment to address the tragedy of the personal differential. I am here to assure pensioners who did not see an increase because of the personal differential that they will have the support of the state until the personal differential is finally erased.
