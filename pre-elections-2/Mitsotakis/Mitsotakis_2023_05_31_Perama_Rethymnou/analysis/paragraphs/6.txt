This is the picture of the future I envision for our Crete. It is a picture that is inextricably linked - I cannot fail to mention it here, my dear Mayor - to the primary sector. Especially here, in Mylopotamos, you are aware of the traditional relations that Constantine Mitsotakis had with your region. I do not need to say more. He bequeathed to me his love for our mountains, for our Psiloritis, for our White Mountains, and for the mountains of Lassithi. You are right, Mayor, to say that the heart of livestock farming beats here. I strongly believe in the future of quality livestock farming.
