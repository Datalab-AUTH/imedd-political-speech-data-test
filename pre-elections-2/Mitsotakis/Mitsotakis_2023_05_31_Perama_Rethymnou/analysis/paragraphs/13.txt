This is the goal that I set for the June 25th ballot box, and to make a bet between us, Mr. Mayor, John: to write "4" in front of our percentage in Rethymno. We can. We achieved it in Chania. We can do it here too. Because this will give us - and this is not just a manifestation of complacency - it is very important for the country today to have a strong government - a stable government with a four-year horizon. This stable government today is a prerequisite for prosperity for Greek society. Because the last thing we would want, I believe, is to have a government with a slim parliamentary majority. We don't need that; we need to have a strong parliamentary majority, equivalent - if not greater - to the one we had in the last four years, so that we can move forward with our hands free to make the great changes that we have talked about.
