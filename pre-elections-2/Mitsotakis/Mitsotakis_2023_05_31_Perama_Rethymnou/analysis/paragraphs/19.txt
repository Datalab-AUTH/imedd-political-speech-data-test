I have a commitment here. I owe you a snowplow. That's my personal commitment. Who would have thought that the "New York Times" would write an article about "Where do you ski the best in the world in the spring? On Psiloritis." For our friends from Livadia, from Zoniana, we're going to make it all, and I want to say thank you again. May you all be well and may we be here again, with good luck, to celebrate the victory of the New Democracy for another four years of growth and prosperity. Thank you very much.
