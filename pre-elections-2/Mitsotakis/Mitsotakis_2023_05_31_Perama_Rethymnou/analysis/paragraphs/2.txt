And of course, Crete is blue and will remain blue. Because we must not forget that we still have one more election ahead of us. We are not finished and we must be absolutely sure that in the next election, on June 25th, there will be no complacency. All those who voted for us will vote for us again and we may even win some more new citizens. A good friend of mine told me a nice mantra: "Today all your voters here are proud of you and those who didn't vote for you may regret it." I'm keeping the "maybe."
