A number of other major development projects will also change the appearance of our island. The airport in Kastelli is already making progress. The major interconnection to which the Mayor referred is so important because Crete has, until now, been totally dependent on imports of oil and fuel oil to produce electricity. Think about how different things will be when Crete can export its own electricity. And, of course, this electricity that we will produce from our own resources, from the sun, from the wind, will make it much easier for us to reduce the cost of electricity. This is important for our farmers, for our small crafts, for our households.
