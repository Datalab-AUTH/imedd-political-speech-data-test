So I ask you, friends, that there be no resting on your laurels in this election. Nothing has been decided. The ballot box is empty again. There is no first and second round here. This is not a football game where "we won 4-0 and we keep that score in the second game." Here we are starting from the beginning; so from the beginning, we will fill the ballot boxes with a lot of New Democracy ballots. We have the wind in our sails. We are winners, we are not arrogant. We are happy but we are not arrogant. So let us go so that we can - when I am back in Crete in the summer - have a great celebration here on Psiloritis, so that we can come here.
