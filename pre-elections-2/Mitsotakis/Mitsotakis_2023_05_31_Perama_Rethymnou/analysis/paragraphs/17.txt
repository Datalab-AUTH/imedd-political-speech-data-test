We want to emphasize quality, and of course, for our livestock products, quality means better prices. Let there be no doubt about it. If you produce a quality product, you have to claim the right price, as long as we know that the product is certified, of high quality, and standardized. All these nice things that are starting to happen, you should know that they can continue and give our Crete as a whole the opportunity to be a leader in tourism, but also in the primary sector, just as we have been all these years. One thing you should know: with Mitsotakis as Prime Minister, the best is ahead for our Crete. Know this. We have proven it in practice, and we will continue to prove it in the next four years.
