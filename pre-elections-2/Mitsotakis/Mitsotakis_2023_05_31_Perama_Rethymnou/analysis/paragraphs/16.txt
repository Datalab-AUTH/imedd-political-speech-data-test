I believe that our Crete will be the main beneficiary of this development proposal which we have presented to the Greek people for judgment. You can already see what is happening on the island. Sometimes people say to me, "But how can you come to the private economy and say that wages will rise to 1,500 euros, the average wage?" And I tell them quite simply that the more quality investments are made and the more visitors we attract who are willing to spend more money, the easier it is for businesses to pay better wages to the young people who work in hotels, and for these young people to demand better wages because unemployment is falling. So wages go up. That is what we want.
