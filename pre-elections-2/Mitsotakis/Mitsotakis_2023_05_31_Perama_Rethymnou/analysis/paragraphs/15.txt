Our opponents are the ones who have "lost their marbles" and one day they tell us that they will increase contributions tax again, and now PASOK comes along and tells us that they will increase ENFIA and tax on dividends. Every day they tell us something different; perhaps they can afford to do it because they themselves have abdicated the responsibility of running the country. What are they telling us? "We're interested in who's first in opposition." People don't care about that; people vote for the government, not for the opposition, and that's why I'm sure that they will trust us again with even greater percentages and give us the power to continue our work for the good of all of you.
