Let me say one more thing about our health. We will rebuild 156 health centers throughout the country from the resources of the Recovery Fund. We have Irini Agapidaki with us, who is a Cretan and the head of our State Electoral Committee. She honors us with her presence and is an expert on health issues. We are very happy. You will know for sure that the next day, especially on health issues, in Crete you will have your own person who will fight for quality health. Whether we are talking about our hospitals or the hospitals of Rethymnon, where so many important interventions are being made, or whether we are talking about health centers or clinics in the Greek region.
