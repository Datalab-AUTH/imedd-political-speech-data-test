Why have I told you all this, friends? Because I do not want to be drawn back into a toxic debate of confrontation with our political opponents in any way during these four weeks left until the elections, whom the Greek people have already condemned. We have no doubt that the result of the ballot box was deafening. For the first time, a party in power increased its percentages and the absolute number of votes. So this image of a black Greece, as presented by SYRIZA - SYRIZA and PASOK to a large extent - simply does not exist. We did not say that Greece has turned into a paradise, but Greece today is certainly a much better country than it was in 2019.
