Good morning and thank you for the warm welcome. Mayor Giannis, dear friends, I couldn't resist stopping by Milopotamos during my two-day tour of our island to personally thank you for giving our party the highest percentage of votes among all the municipalities in the Regional Unit of Rethymnon. A big thank you to each and every one of you for the support you have given to New Democracy, which, in my opinion, is also support for me personally. I made a bet with myself and all our partners at the beginning of this election period that seemed difficult - perhaps not so difficult here in Rethymno, but difficult in some other Regional Units of Crete - that the whole of Crete would turn blue. And we achieved our goal.
