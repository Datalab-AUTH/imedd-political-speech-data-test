And, of course, we also discussed how we perceive the future of our country because all elections are ultimately about the future, not the past. The percentage we received was certainly a reward for the serious work we have done for four years. At the same time, however, citizens have placed their expectations on us as to what we want to do from now on. Especially here in Crete, I have not hidden that we have very ambitious plans. The next four years will be a period of very big changes for Crete. It is the four years in which, at last, the biggest development project in the history of Crete will finally get off the ground, which is none other than the Northern Road Axis. This is a personal commitment of mine, which is finally being put into practice, a project that in 2019 we basically received on paper - it was a line on the map - and we managed to get it underway. We broke it into three parts, secured the necessary funding, and we are now absolutely certain that within the next year - the first construction sites have already started on the Lassithi section - the tender process for the major concession contract from Chania to Heraklion will be completed. We will now finally see this project moving forward, completed soon, so that you can travel safely and we can finally stop mourning so many unjust deaths on the roads of our island. It is a personal commitment of mine, and we will make this project a reality. It will be from Kissamos to Sitia. It will cover the whole length of Crete and will indeed change the face of our island.
