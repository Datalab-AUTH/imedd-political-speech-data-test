You know, our opponents were very proud of a negotiation that they did. They went to Brussels in 2015, negotiated for 17 hours, came back, and gave us a memorandum that cost us 100 billion. I went to Brussels and negotiated in the summer of 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, for five days, not 17 hours. And what I brought back to the country is 31 billion from the Recovery Fund. This money is not an abstraction; it concerns you. Some of that money is going to the Northern Highway. A chunk of that money will go to put interactive whiteboards in all schools from Grade 5 to Grade 3. So that young children, who are here in the villages of Mylopotamos, know that they have the same access to quality education as a child growing up in a large urban center.
