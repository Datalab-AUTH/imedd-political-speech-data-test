Mr. Mayor, first of all, I want to say a big thank you for the services you have provided to the local government over the decades. I want you to know that we have had excellent cooperation with the Mayor in solving big and small problems of the place. We have supported the local government more than any other government in the history of the post-independence period, with many financial instruments. We did not look at parties in local government - no matter if you always wore a blue jacket. I think that in this way, we demonstrated that ultimately what made the difference between New Democracy and our political opponents was precisely that we bent over the real problems of society and provided solutions to the problems. We kept society on its feet in the midst of major crises.
