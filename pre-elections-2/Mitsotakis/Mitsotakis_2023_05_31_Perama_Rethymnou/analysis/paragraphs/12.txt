The big issue in this ballot is how we can continue on this course and have a stable government for the next four years that can deliver all the things I have talked to you about. That is why this ballot is so important. You also know that the arithmetic of the electoral law can raise the bar of self-reliance this time. What do I mean? The more parties that enter parliament, the more difficult it becomes to achieve self-reliance. But I have no doubt that we will not only reach our quota but exceed it.
