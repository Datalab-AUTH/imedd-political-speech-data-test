Note the emphasis on quality livestock farming. It is quality that can ultimately allow us to get better prices for our meat, milk, and cheese. We should protect our products and link them to our tourism industry. This means that visitors can leave the coast and visit the mainland, mountains, and production units to buy our products. Once they taste and love them, they will continue to buy them abroad. You should know that I am your best ally in upgrading and supporting quality livestock farming. John was right when he said that we negotiated European resources efficiently and secured all CAP resources without losing a single euro compared to other countries. Additionally, our NSRF has increased resources, especially the Cretan CIP, and we have access to the Recovery Fund.
