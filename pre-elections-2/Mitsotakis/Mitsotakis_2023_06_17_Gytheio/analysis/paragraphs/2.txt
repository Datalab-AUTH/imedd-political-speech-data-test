Of course, let me begin by expressing once again my anguish and the anguish of all of us. We are all shocked by the tragic shipwreck off the coast of Pylos, in international waters - I stress this - which unfortunately cost the lives of hundreds of persecuted people who were looking for a better tomorrow. But as shocked as we are, friends, we must be equally outraged at the wretched traffickers. For these bastards - allow me this harsh language - who traffic in human suffering, exploit human frailties and load persecuted people into rotten boats, at great risk of sinking in the middle of the Mediterranean. But as angry as we are with these traffickers, who are ultimately the real perpetrators of this tragedy, I believe we are equally disappointed with those who, in the midst of this tragedy, have once again found an opportunity, instead of turning their attention to the traffickers, to denounce - in effect - their own country and the Coast Guard, which has made a commendable effort to save hundreds of people in extremely difficult conditions. I do not want to spend too much time with them. We leave them alone in their isolation. I just want to remind you that all those who today present themselves as the supposedly authentic exponents of humanity were the same people who allowed the 'Moria dungeons'. They were the same ones who opened the borders of the homeland to millions of people who crossed Greece in 2015. They were the same ones who a few days ago were condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for the miserable conditions that prevailed in Moria at the time. And they are the ones who come now and tell us that they are the only ones who have the right to talk about humanitarianism.
