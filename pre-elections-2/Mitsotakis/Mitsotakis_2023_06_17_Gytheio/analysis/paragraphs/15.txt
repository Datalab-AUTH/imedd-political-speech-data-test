I want you to know, friends, that there is a lot of talk from our opponents now because they understand that they have been subjected to an electoral "patatrach". They have a new narrative. They say, "New Democracy should not be all-powerful". Only the Greek people are omnipotent. It is they who send the members to parliament and determine the parliamentary majorities.
