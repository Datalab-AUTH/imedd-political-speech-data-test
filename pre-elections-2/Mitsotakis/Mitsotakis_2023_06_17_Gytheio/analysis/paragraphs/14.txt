Friends, I don't want to talk much more about our program because we have already had the opportunity to present it in detail, and we will present it even more in the week between now and the elections. I just want to ask you again not to be complacent. The ballot box is critical, and as you know, there is a strong possibility of more parties entering the House. That means that the bar for self-reliance is rising. It's getting higher, and that means that we're going to need an even stronger percentage in the June 25 ballot than we had in the May 21 ballot. Why? To ensure a stable government with a four-year horizon that can deliver the big changes I have committed to. And we will have that stable government, friends. I have no doubt. We will have it so that we can continue this important work that we have begun.
