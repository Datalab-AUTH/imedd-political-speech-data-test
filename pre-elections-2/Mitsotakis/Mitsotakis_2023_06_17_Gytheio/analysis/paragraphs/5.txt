That is why the program that you have in your hands, "Steady, Boldly Forward for Greece 2027," is a commitment of New Democracy that will be strictly adhered to. We know that we can do what we say we will do. We will continue to strive for a policy that puts the emphasis on results first and foremost, on how to keep growth rates high, on creating more well-paid jobs, especially for young people who need to return from abroad, and for the young children who stayed in our country to know that they will find a good job with a good salary, so that they too can move on and have their own family.
