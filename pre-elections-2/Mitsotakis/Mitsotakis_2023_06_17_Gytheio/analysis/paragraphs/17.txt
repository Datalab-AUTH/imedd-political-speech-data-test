I have learned to always set the bar high. I have said many times that my purpose is not to be a mere administrator. I want to change the course of the country. I want to make Greece truly a European country, a safe country. A country that we can be proud of, a country that will play a leading role in developments in Europe. A country that is a pillar of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean. A country which, first and foremost, will give opportunities to all young children, whether they are born in Athens or in a small village in Mani, to excel and succeed in life. This is our vision, help us make it a reality. Give us the power to change our country for the better.
