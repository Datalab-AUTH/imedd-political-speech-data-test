Friends, as I said, I want to use these few days left before the elections to talk even more convincingly about what we want to do in the next four years. The citizens rewarded the seriousness, efficiency, integrity, and decency of the New Democracy government at the ballot box on May 21. They acknowledged that we have stood by society through all the difficulties, credited us for holding the country's ship steady in extremely difficult times, and rewarded us for keeping all our key election commitments. I can assure you that I will not jeopardize this relationship of trust that we have now built with Greek society under any circumstances.
