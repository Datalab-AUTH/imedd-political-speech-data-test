Look, friends, we have followed a different policy on refugees. A policy of fairness, rigor, surveillance, and border control. A policy that has resulted in a 90% reduction in illegal entries into our country. In this way, we have not only protected our borders but also relieved our islands of structures with tens of thousands of refugees and migrants. Ultimately, we have saved lives. Because the fewer people there are at sea, the less chance of a tragic shipwreck like the one that happened a few days ago. We actually crushed the traffickers. We have protected our borders, the borders of Europe, and saved thousands of people who were in danger at sea. It is really unfair today for our coastguard to be insinuated by some so-called solidarity people that they have not done their job well. But so be it. We leave them to the judgment of society. What I want to say to you here again, from Gythio, from Laconia, is that the policy of guarding our country's borders will continue. The fence on the Evros will be completed, our country has borders that it must guard, and at the same time, we will always be there to rescue any persecuted person who needs our help. This is a policy that has now been recognized as a sound policy by Europe as a whole. European asylum and immigration policy start with the guarding of the external borders of the European Union. This is Greek national policy and has become European policy. And that is how it should be.
