Just as we want to talk and do important things for public health the next day. Public health and the reform of the National Health System are personal bets of mine. I still remember my visit to the health centre in Areopolis when I was still the leader of the opposition, and the substantive discussion we had about how we need to change our whole approach to healthcare, emphasizing primary care and prevention. These policies have started to be implemented. For the first time in our country, we are running prevention programs designed to identify diseases before you know about them. The 'Fofi Gennimata' program for women over 50 for breast cancer has already enabled us to diagnose almost 10,000 women who had breast cancer but did not know it. They found out through a screening test which they had, either in a public or private facility, but free of charge. And now we are allowed to intervene, and these women are allowed to be cured. We want to put the same emphasis on our health centers. Here, the health center in Gythio - I understand that it has already acquired an ambulance - is relatively well-equipped. But I want you to know that the Recovery Fund will finance the new equipment of the health center, and you will have a model health center here in Gythio. Just like the model health center in Areopolis. Because we want to be able to treat patients before they eventually reach our hospitals. And, of course, Laconia will also have the very great dowry of having perhaps the most modern hospital in the country in Sparta in 2026, the great donation of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, which will go ahead with our support. So you understand how important it is to have healthcare that starts with prevention, that provides good primary care, that we now have personal doctors. The institution of the Personal Doctor is now taking root in Greek society. But, at the same time, for our fellow citizens who will need a hospital, they will be able to get to a state-of-the-art hospital with fast transfers to get the care they deserve. This will truly be a health revolution. And here in Laconia in particular, we will be able to provide a health service that will be as high quality as you deserve to have, equivalent to the best health service in any European country. This is my goal, and we are not going to discount this priority.
