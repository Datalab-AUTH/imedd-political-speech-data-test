Mr Regional Governor, friends, and Young Democrats, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this impressive welcome. I left Athens in cloudy weather and arrived in Mani in sunshine. June 25th will be sunny for our country. A new day will dawn, and we will reaffirm the strong mandate we received on May 21st. We will commit ourselves in this week leading up to next Sunday's elections to raise the bar of our expectations even higher and exceed it. Mr President and Mr Mayor, there was no way the election period could end without me keeping my commitment to be in Laconia, especially here in Gythio, the capital of Mani, to say a big thank you. To say a big thank you for your enduring support for our party, New Democracy. I was, if I am not mistaken, 23 years old, and I still remember Konstantinos Mitsotakis' trek to Mani. Some of you will remember it. I know that my family here had many friends and many girlfriends. After all, the ties between Crete and Mani are unbreakable; we are brothers and sisters. But I want us all to make a bet together: the percentage of New Democracy in Laconia must say '5' on the front. For a few hundred votes, you were "stolen" by the Dodecanese; you have to "fix" that. I am sure, friends, that you will. The Mayor may have said that the election has been discounted. I will ask you in this week left to run our race to allow no complacency. The polls are empty; they need to be refilled. They will be refilled with many New Democracy ballots. It will be an opportunity in this last week, as we head towards the elections, not to engage in sterile confrontations with parties that have anyway discounted their own defeat but to talk positively about our own program, about what we want to do in our country over the next four years. And we have a lot to do. We have a lot of important work to continue and to complete - of course, and in Mani, I'll say the Mani stuff, don't worry.
