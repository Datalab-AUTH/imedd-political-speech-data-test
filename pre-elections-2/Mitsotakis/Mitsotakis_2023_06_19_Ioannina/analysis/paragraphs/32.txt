What the Syriza humanitarians, who have been scrutinizing the situation, are not telling us is that between 2015 and 2019, three times as many people drowned in the Aegean as died between 2019 and 2022, precisely because fewer boats were leaving the coast of Turkey. The so-called humanitarians, who care about the value of human life, were the ones who allowed - hypocrites indeed - the Moria sweatshops. It was condemned a few days ago in the European Court of Human Rights for the conditions that prevailed in Moria. So let them stop wagging their finger at us and stop targeting our Coast Guard. And recognize that the main culprit for the tragedy that happened in Pylos was the miserable traffickers and not the Coast Guard, which after all tried to save as many people as it could.
