Thank you. I was a little late, but I brought you sunshine. The 25th of June will be just as sunny, the day of the great new victory of our New Democracy. Friends, Young Democrats, UNNEDites, there was no way the election period could be completed without me returning to my beloved Ioannina. I am here, Mr. President, Mr. Regional Governor, dear fellow candidates in Parliament, Mr. Mayors, first and foremost because I want to individually thank each and every one of you for the percentage we achieved in Ioannina and Epirus as a whole. We set ourselves the goal of painting the whole of Epirus blue, and we have made the whole of Greece blue.
