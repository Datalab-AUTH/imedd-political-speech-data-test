So, this robust policy is the policy that will also allow us, tomorrow, from a position of strength and not from a position of weakness, to be able to sit down at the table with Turkey and see if we can resolve our chronic issue, our major dispute, which is none other than the delimitation of the maritime zones, the EEZ, and the continental shelf in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. But this negotiation must be conducted on the right terms, and Turkey must know that there are a number of issues that I will not agree to discuss with them. Greece does not discuss issues of demilitarization of the islands, and Greece does not discuss issues that have to do with our national sovereignty and sovereign rights.
