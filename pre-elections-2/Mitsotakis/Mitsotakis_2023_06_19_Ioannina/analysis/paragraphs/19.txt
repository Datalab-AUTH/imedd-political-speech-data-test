These are things that we need to fix. We need to intervene and modernize the emergency departments. The work has already started. You have two excellent hospitals here, and I want you to know that within a four-year horizon, both of your hospitals will have modernized emergency departments that will be able to deal with emergencies in a completely different way than what is done today. But it's not just about what we do in our hospitals. It's about what we do in our health centers, it's about what we do at the level of prevention, the Personal Doctor, how we make sure that not everybody is running to the hospitals when they have a problem, but how primary care can be a 'mound' of health for all citizens.
