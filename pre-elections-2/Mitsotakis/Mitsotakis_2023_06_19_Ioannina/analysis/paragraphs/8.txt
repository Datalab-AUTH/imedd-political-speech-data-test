Friends, this second election period was an opportunity to reiterate our programmatic speech, but it was also an opportunity to highlight the absurdity of the proportional representation ballot box. You may remember that when I came and spoke to you here in Ioannina before the elections, I predicted the result, telling you that it was impossible to form a government through the proportional representation ballot box. We are now called upon to go through a second electoral process, which is expensive for the Greek public sector, and we have to be here again today to talk to you about what we want to do. If the system we are now going to use for elections had been in place during the previous polls, the country would already have a stable government, I would have been Prime Minister, and we would already be working on solving the country's major problems.
