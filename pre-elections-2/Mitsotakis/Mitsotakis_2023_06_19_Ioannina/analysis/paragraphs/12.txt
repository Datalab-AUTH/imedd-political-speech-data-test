I had the opportunity to visit a very impressive new exhibition of contemporary art called Pl√°smata in the area of the old Castle before coming to talk to you. I was really amazed by the new dimensions that we can give and the new identity that a city like Ioannina can acquire as a center of culture, of contemporary culture. We are not only proud of our history, but we are also optimistic about our future. This is exactly what the ballot box is about: how we can seize the future and create a better tomorrow, especially for these young children, our students, here at the University of Ioannina.
