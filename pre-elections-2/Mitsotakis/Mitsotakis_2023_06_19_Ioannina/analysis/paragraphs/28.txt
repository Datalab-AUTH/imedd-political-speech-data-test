But, friends, our politics are not limited to what happens within the walls. Over the last four years, if there is one thing I am proud of, it is that when I go abroad, Greece's opinion counts. They no longer look at us as if we were the poor relation. And yes, Greece's voice is heard from the United States Congress to Brussels, and it is heard with confidence. This policy of a strong Greece, with a foreign policy that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, which understands Greece's geopolitical role and position, must continue.
