And the reason why, my friends, we are asking for stable self-reliance after June 25th is precisely so that we can implement the great changes that the country needs so much. And I am sure that the Greek people will give us this stable, strong self-reliance. All of us together this Sunday, because no vote should be wasted and because no election result is predetermined in advance. I will not tire of saying it: the ballot boxes are empty; they must be filled with millions of New Democracy ballots. On the evening of June 25th, we will make the "cash", we will all go to the ballot box together, and we will all reaffirm the strong mandate we give to New Democracy to take the country firmly, boldly, upwards.
