I often talk about the need to raise wages in our country, and I believe in it a lot. This is something I often hear from young people. They study, finish university, and then find that the wages they receive are still low. We know how to raise wages, and when I say that we will increase the average wage to EUR 1,500 and the minimum wage to EUR 950, we know how to make it happen.
