And the third aspect of this strong policy, which is quite timely given the tragic recent events, is a robust but fair policy on the issue of migration. The country has borders in the air, at sea, and on land, and has shown that it can and does guard them. We will pursue this policy because it is the right policy for the country's national security. But I dare say that it is also the right policy in terms of human care for the protection of human life. Because, friends, we have crushed the trafficking rings in the Aegean, and the fewer boats that leave the coast of Turkey - because they know that they will hardly reach Greek islands - the fewer people are ultimately in danger at sea.
