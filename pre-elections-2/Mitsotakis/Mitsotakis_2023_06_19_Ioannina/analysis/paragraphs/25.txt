But we did not only fix the pension system. We gave pensioners significant increases for the first time in 12 years. Our government gave increases of almost 8%, and we also addressed the tragedy of the personal differential. And I'm here to tell you again that those pensioners who didn't see an increase in their pensions because of the personal differential, know that you will continue to receive support from the state until the personal differential is finally erased.
