New Democracy is the only political force that has a coherent plan against the scourge of underpopulation and the shrinking of the Greek population. We want to support working mothers in particular. We know that it is not easy for a woman who works to have children at the same time. That is why we place so much emphasis on day nursery programs, all-day kindergarten, and the balance between personal and professional time. These are policies that will allow women to have their first, second, and third children more comfortably than they have been doing so far.
