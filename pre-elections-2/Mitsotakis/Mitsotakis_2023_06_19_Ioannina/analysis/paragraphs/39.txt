But I will not hide from you, friends, that the large percentage we gathered certainly came as a pleasant surprise. However, I want you to know that the higher the percentage we collect, the greater the burden that falls on our shoulders. This burden equals responsibility, for me and for the members of the New Republic who will be more numerous in the next Parliament. You will give us a strong mandate to change the country at the ballot box on Sunday. I want you to know one thing: I will not betray the trust you have placed in me, the love you have shown me, or the appreciation you have shown for our party.
