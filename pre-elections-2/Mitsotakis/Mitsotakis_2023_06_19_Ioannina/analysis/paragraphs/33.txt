I also read about the fence on the Evros. Just one word about "Little Maria". Yes, "Little Maria". Do you remember Little Maria? They slandered the country abroad without telling the truth about an incident that never happened. Whenever they find an opportunity to slander the country abroad, they do it systematically. Then they get indignant when we say "national exception". Unfortunately, this is the truth. Even today, Mr. Mouzalas, who managed the refugee portfolio under Syriza, still says, "When the fence on Evros comes down, I will feel the same joy that I felt when the Berlin Wall came down." So I say to him, the fence on the Evros will not come down because the next government will be the government of the New Democracy. Not only will it not fall, but the project will be completed.
