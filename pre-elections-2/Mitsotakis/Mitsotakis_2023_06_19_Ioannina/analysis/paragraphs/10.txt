And let's talk, yes, Mr. President and Mr. Regional Governor, about how to make Ioannina and Epirus a model of development for the entire territory. The first steps have already been taken; we must now complete the work. It is indeed very impressive that here, for example, in Ioannina, a dynamic high-tech industry is developing, and I meet young people who return from abroad, not to Athens or Thessaloniki, but to Ioannina to work in high-tech companies. This is extremely encouraging.
