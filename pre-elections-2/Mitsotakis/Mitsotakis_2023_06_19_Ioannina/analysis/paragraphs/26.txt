All that has been done is a lot. It is difficult to contain. For example, consider the digital revolution and gov.gr. When we came to govern the country, the ability to communicate with the state was basically through inconvenience and queues. But now we have the next phase of gov.gr and the overall restructuring of the Civil Service. There is one phrase that I do not negotiate when it comes to our interventions in the public sector: evaluation everywhere, meritocracy everywhere. The best individuals should be in the best positions, and good civil servants should also be rewarded with additional salaries. We will increase spending on civil servants' payroll by EUR 500 million, and we will prioritize support for families with children.
