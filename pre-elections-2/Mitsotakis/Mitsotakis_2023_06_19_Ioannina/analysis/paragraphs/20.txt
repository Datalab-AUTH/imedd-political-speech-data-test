Of course, I would like to say a word about an issue that has hurt us a lot lately - those few cases where the ambulance did not manage to arrive on time and unfortunately we have suffered loss of life. A big thank you to the ambulance rescuers first of all. They are doing an excellent job. For every tragic incident, there are hundreds of thousands of cases where people get to the hospitals on time. However, we must improve here too, and we must improve using all the possibilities that modern technology and all the means that we have at our disposal today. It is a commitment that I made a year and a half ago, in memory of a young boy who was so unjustly lost in Tzoumerka, Ermis Theocharopoulos, that we should finally be able to acquire a modern rescue system with flexible helicopters that are staffed with medical personnel specialised in emergency medicine.
