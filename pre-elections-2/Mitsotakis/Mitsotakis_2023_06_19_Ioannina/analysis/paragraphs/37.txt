But, as I said, our aim now is to look ahead, not to worry about our opponent, and to go together in these few days left until the polls to fight the battle, to convince our fellow citizens - not those who voted for us, as I believe they will vote for us again - but to convince those who may not have voted for us that we are indeed worthy of their trust. This is precisely because the country needs a stable government the next day.
