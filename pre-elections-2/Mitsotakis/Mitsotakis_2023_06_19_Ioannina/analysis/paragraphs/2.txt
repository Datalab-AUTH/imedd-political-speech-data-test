But I am also here to remind you that the work is not yet finished.  On 25 June we have another election. The ballot boxes are empty and the goal we must set is to achieve an even higher percentage in the June 25 election. Here in Ioannina we want to get three MPs. And our percentage, here in Ioannina, should read '4' on the front. I am sure that all of us together will achieve this goal.I wonder how many people on May 20 would have been willing to bet that all of Greece would be blue. But this great electoral victory of ours, friends, was, yes, a reward for the great work that we have done for four years now, holding the country upright in the midst of great crises, setting a path of growth for the Greek economy, supporting society in the midst of great difficulties - coronavirus, energy crisis - but also telling the citizens the truth throughout these four years.
