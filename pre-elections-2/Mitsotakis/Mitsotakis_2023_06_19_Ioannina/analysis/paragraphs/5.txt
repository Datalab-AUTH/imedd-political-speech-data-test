So we have been rewarded by the citizens. They said 'yes' to truth, 'yes' to progress, 'yes' to unity, 'yes' to modesty, 'yes' to the decency of political discourse, and 'yes' to programmatic discourse. But they also punished some people who invested in division, lies, blackness, and toxicity. We, friends, do not need to fill all of Ioannina with paper posters to gather people. Interestingly enough, in a moment, Mr. Tsipras will be in another place here in Ioannina to talk to us. There is no need for any disapproval because the greatest disapproval that the people have for their elected leaders is the verdict of the ballot box. The Greek citizens have said it all, giving us more than double the 'score' of Syriza.
