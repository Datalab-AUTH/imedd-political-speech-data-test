Well, look at this: the National Health System will become a powerful national public health system under a New Democracy government. And those who criticize us today obviously do not know or do not want to know that under our watch, more than 200 new cancer treatments with modern and very expensive drugs were approved. No patient under a New Democracy government will ever be deprived of any medicine, no matter how expensive, if it is the doctor's opinion that he or she should receive such treatment.
