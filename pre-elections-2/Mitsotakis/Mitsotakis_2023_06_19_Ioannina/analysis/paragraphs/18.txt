In addition to what we want to do in education, my friends, I have a very ambitious plan for what we need to do with the National Health System. First of all, I want to say a big thank you again to our doctors, nurses, and all the health workers who kept society on its feet in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. This unprecedented healthcare adventure has highlighted the weaknesses of the NHS, but it has also highlighted its strengths. Our duty now is to invest in a National Health System that will provide quality health services to all Greeks, wherever they are, whether they are in Ioannina or in an isolated village in Tzoumerka or Zagori. This starts with my commitment to recruit 10,000 doctors and nurses over a four-year horizon in the National Health System because, yes, we still have delays, and we must be able to face the truth. I am saddened every time a fellow citizen comes to me and says, "I have to wait months to have regular surgery."
