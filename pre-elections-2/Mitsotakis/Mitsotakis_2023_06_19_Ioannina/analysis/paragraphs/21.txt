The relevant bill has already been adopted. I believe that very soon we will have six helicopter bases that will assist the work of the ambulance service and will be able to carry out a rescue, for example, in a mountain village where the ambulance cannot reach quickly. This is how we understand the modern way of providing immediate assistance, and also how we understand the partnership between the public and private sectors, ladies and gentlemen.
