It is really very, very sad that we are in the position today of having a public debate and asking Syriza to do the obvious. What is that? To ask its two elected MPs to state very simply that they respect the Lausanne Treaty and acknowledge that there is a Muslim minority, not a 'Turkish' one, in Thrace. It is as simple as that. You ask yourself why they do not do so and why Mr Tsipras, who will be speaking here in Yiannina in a moment, is still covering up for them. Everyone knows this, friends, everyone knows this.
