Because I want you to allow me to deconstruct the biggest lie that Syriza has been peddling in its desperation over the last few weeks, which is that "we will privatize the NHS". What we have heard in the last few days is beyond description. We're going to leave patients, including cancer patients, dying in hospitals because we won't give them drugs, supposedly because these drugs are expensive.
