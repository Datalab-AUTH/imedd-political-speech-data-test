Basically, people are telling us not to bother with the opposition or worry about what others will do. We're not interested in that. The message of the ballot box was to look forward, not to expend energy on engaging in toxic debates with opponents. We need to talk about the future and, above all, explain to citizens what we want to do in the next four years. The reward of the citizens in the ballot box on May 21st was strong, but the demand to move faster and more boldly along the path of great changes was just as strong.
