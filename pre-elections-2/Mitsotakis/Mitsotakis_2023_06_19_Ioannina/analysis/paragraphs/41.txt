All of this and much more will be put into practice together. However, as I have told you, there is one condition for all of this to happen: on the evening of June 25th, the map of Greece must be blue and New Democracy's percentage must be strong. On the 25th we will vote, and on the 26th we will roll up our sleeves and lead Greece strongly forward. Thank you for your love and appreciation. Fly the flags of New Democracy and Greece. It will be a beautiful, sunny day on June 25th with blue skies and New Democracy as the great winner of the elections. Be well and goodbye. Thank you very much.
