On 26 June, we will roll up our sleeves and work even harder. We will work for the big ones and the small ones, and we will work with the Region and the Municipality. After all, we have many outstanding issues here that we still have to complete. The road from Ioannina to Kakavia has gone through "forty waves," but we will make it happen and build this road. The Velissari camp, which I had the opportunity to pass by just now, will be returned to the local authorities. The Technology Park, which will be so important for Ioannina, will finally have a place that will attract companies.
