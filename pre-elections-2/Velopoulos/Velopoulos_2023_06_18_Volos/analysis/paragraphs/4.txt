We fully understand and have a view of the national economy. I will reiterate that things are not good, despite claims to the contrary. Mrs. Lagarde has already mentioned a new increase in lending rates, which means we cannot borrow and borrowers will be forced to pay an extra installment every month. This will create more problems for the consumer market. The economy is not just a drawing on paper; it requires a plan and action, not just words.
