In conclusion, I would like to say something simple about Mrs Bakoyannis. Sometimes she comes across as a bit cynical, and she speaks a few truths. For example, she once said that the Internet is the most socialist invention since the religion of Christ. In other words, Mrs Bakoyannis is suggesting that Christ is an invention. She has a good understanding of orthodoxy and she sent Mr Adonis Georgiades to Mount Athos to worship the axion esti on all fours. According to her, our Jesus is an invention. If someone were to say that Mohammed is an invention, there would surely be a revolution. However, they know very well how to touch on what the Greeks believe. They can easily desecrate and curse, but if you speak the same way about other religions, they call you a racist. We should respect all religions in our relationships with others, and it is racist to insult any religion, regardless of which one it is. Unfortunately, they do not respect our Christian faith, especially.
