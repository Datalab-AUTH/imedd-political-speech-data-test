I am particularly concerned about what Bloomberg reported. If I am not mistaken, Bloomberg reported it and Kathimerini reproduced it. This government is investing a lot in tourism. I think monoculture tourism is criminal. We are making terrible mistakes in tourism. Tourism is not a heavy industry. I have said it thousands of times before, and if we only have vertical tourism from production to hotel, that is the only way it could be a heavy industry. Most of the products within tourist accommodation are imported, which means that the money goes out. What I want to say and insist on is that I see a reduction from Germany so far this year in bookings and cancellations of 14.9%, from France 8.1%, from Italy 2.2%, and from the Netherlands 1.2%. That means that the signals are not very good. I said it last year, and I don't know if some people remember it. I said that because of inflation and the economic malaise in Europe, we would see a reduction in tourist arrivals. I must also say that we are making a mistake. I may bore you, but I think we all need to understand what tourism is. Tourism does not mean that I have 25 million tourists because these 25 million both consume my water and put a strain on my infrastructure and create greater problems for me. I would rather have 7 million with the same income affected here than 25 million or 30 million tourists. The flip-flop tourist is not a tourist who will leave you money, and you know the problem with Greek tourism is that the tourists who come here the most leave only 20 euros per day, while in Italy it is about 45 euros per head and in Spain 37 euros. This is the difference between the philosophical approach and the political approach of the Greek Solution and the real economy, an approach that is mainly about the most profit with the least effort. Because it takes thinking and it takes brains.
