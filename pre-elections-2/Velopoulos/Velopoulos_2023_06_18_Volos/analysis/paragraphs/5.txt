We proposed a plan over a year ago, when the government launched Exco, that all of the Recovery Fund money should be used to install photovoltaic panels on the rooftops of every home. We are not referring to photovoltaic parks on Greek land that benefit energy providers, but rather to individual homes. Based on our study, if 35% of roofs had photovoltaic panels, the average household would pay 80% less on the PPC tariff. We submitted our study to the Greek parliament, but unfortunately, this government has once again favored the rich, oligarchic energy providers, and pseudo-investors instead of citizens. To illustrate the potential savings and profits for the national economy, Greece currently pays approximately EUR 1.8 billion for electricity fuel. If 35% of Greek roofs had photovoltaic panels, we could save about 2 billion euros annually. The money is not allocated in the budget, but in the recovery fund, which is being used to fund wind turbines and photovoltaics, allowing energy providers to profit while citizens pay.
