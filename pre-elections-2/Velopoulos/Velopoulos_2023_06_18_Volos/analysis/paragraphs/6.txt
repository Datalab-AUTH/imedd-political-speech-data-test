This is a different philosophy and approach to the issues that plague the economy. You know, what the Prime Minister doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand because I guess their economics. I don't know what it was like at Harvard, but in Greece, it's bad. Economic policy should always be for the benefit of the citizen and not an imposition by numbers. When Greeks talk about economics, mostly politics refer to GDP numbers, balance sheets, and budgets. And all these numbers refer to people. This is what the Prime Minister forgets, that they are numbers that refer to people. And it doesn't mean that the numbers are prospering with accounting alchemy that people are also having a good time and prospering.
