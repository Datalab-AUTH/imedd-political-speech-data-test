These are my wishes for the citizens of Magnesia: to those who did not vote for us in the last elections, we ask for one vote from each family. We thank them for honoring us with their vote. It is a difficult struggle, but we continue to fight despite our meager means. We are guerrilla politicians, outside the system, but in the hearts of the Greek people. It is important for us to be in the heart and soul of the Greek people, not in the heart and soul of the system. Therefore, I urge them to vote for the Greek solution in the next elections, and they will never regret it. I say this honestly, they will never regret it.
