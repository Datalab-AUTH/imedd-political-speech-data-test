I would like to start by talking a little bit about the news, which is very important in our view. Today, in the usual escalation of parochialism, the Prime Minister mentioned healthcare. He started talking again about recruitment, new staff, nursing, and medical staff. He began to spout whatever comes to mind of the man who murdered public healthcare for four years when thousands of dead were lost because it was not needed, as he said. He had studies, of course. And this proves once again that unfortunately in this country, when elections come around, everyone remembers the Greek.
