To give you an example, compensation was given to farmers and livestock farmers in the region a month before the elections. In my view, benefits and allowances should be given at the level of a monthly income, rather than as loans. This may have created a false picture in the election result and caused confusion, indirectly distorting the result. I am adamant about this and not changing my mind. I believe that this government is functioning exactly like all the previous governments of politics that brought the country to the brink of collapse.
