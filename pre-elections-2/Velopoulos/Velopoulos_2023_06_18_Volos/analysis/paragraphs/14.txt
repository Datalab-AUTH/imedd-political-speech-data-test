And I call on all the residents of Magnesia to rise up. Let it be said that history is postponed. And I say it and I said it in the House of Representatives and some people from below cried. Of course I will not say which of your deputies reacted. Don't ask me to say their names don't do it in the election period I do after. Hands off the Pagasitikos Gulf. No LNG terminal in the Gulf of Pagasitikos. They postponed it because of the election the Americans are asking for it, that's why the coronet has American helicopters. Hands off the Pagasitikos, it will become a paralytic. The whole area in case of any mistake or whatever any other action is taken if you want provocative. It is not possible in any country in the world in a bay to build something like this.
