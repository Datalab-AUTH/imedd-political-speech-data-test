And I want to say something that bothered me, and I wish this news weren't true. What's going on with Katsiveli? Thousands of workers will be out on the street. I hear that the company wants the well-known company that bought it to leave Greece and even took a loan guaranteed by the Greek government, if I am not mistaken. So they came in, they made an acquisition, they got a loan (I don't know if they got it yet, but I know it was done or initiated with a guarantee from the Greek government), and now the company wants to leave. These are unbelievable, as Mr. Mytilineos is doing, who, after a year and a half together with Mr. Vardinoyannis, earned billions of euros, is thinking of his July company and going abroad. The solution is, therefore, a 15% horizontal tax on companies and individuals. No tax evasion, no tax avoidance, and above all, no VAT loss. That is the story, and that is the end of the story. You do not need to do anything else. 15% tax. But to do that, you have to be free of tanker tie-ups with illegal oil smuggling. Those are their commitments. These are their friends, and they dare not touch.
