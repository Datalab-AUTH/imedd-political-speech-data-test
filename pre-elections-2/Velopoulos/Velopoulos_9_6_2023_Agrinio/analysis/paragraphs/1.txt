I would like to thank you for being here today. Everyone here started in Messolonghi. We are in Agrinio now, and tomorrow we will be in the city of Ioannina, going door to door and house to house, talking to every Greek individually. Tomorrow morning, we will also go to the city market. We feel that we have to do this because making a speech between cheese and pears, between fans and clankers, is not enough. We want to listen to all the Greek Independents and talk to them.
