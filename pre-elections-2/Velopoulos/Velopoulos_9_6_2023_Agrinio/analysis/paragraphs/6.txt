I am not particularly optimistic because the Prime Minister's lies are overflowing, and I will give an example on Tuesday, the 15th. The European Union Commission meets with a green light from all governments to give money, European Union funds to Skopje. The Prime Minister said during the election campaign that he would veto it if the Skopjeans violate the treacherous Prespa agreement. They have violated it about 200 times, and even now, the Prime Minister does not veto it. Let the Greek people answer for the betrayal of Macedonia. SYRIZA bears a large share of the responsibility, but the continuation of the crime is being done by the New Republic. And this is something to seriously consider two days before the first one is done.
