But you cannot leave the Greek people without hospitals and healthcare. It is unthinkable that you have appointed 3700 post-employees in your country and you cannot appoint 500 physicians. I'm just saying it. So, it was New Democracy's priority to accommodate its own children, and the children of Greece are dying without ambulances and healthcare. This health report could take hours to discuss. I am not optimistic because the aim of New Democracy, I repeat, is to privatize healthcare and trivialize public healthcare. For us, medicines, healthcare, and the health of Greeks must be public, but above all, I will say it once again with benefits, no fairy tales, no suffering for the Greek people.
