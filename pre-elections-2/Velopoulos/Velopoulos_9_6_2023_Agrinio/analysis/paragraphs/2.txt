What we need to comment on is the latest developments in the Pneumatikos case. The Pneumatikos case proves that New Democracy has neither wit nor decency, above all. And I say this because Pneumatikos should have been dismantled in the first place, as his statement defines the inhumanity of the matter. Therefore, since yesterday, the Minister should have taken initiatives. He delayed long enough. It is probably social outcry and popular anger that led him to dismiss the Spiritualist. But to really talk about all that's going on in healthcare, it would take five or six hours. I will say just one thing, and that is what defines our perception: unfortunately, public health has become the den of bribes for New Democracy, PASOK, and SYRIZA. It is well known that the offices of MPs and ministers are patient service offices. Desperate citizens are looking for a bed or an ICU, and as a result, they ask for a bribe. They call and beg to find a bed in hospitals, when it goes without saying that they should have this benefit because they pay contributions. On the other hand, it is well known to everyone that the New Republic is geared towards privatization of healthcare, no matter if the minister is lying once again that he is not aiming for that. Proof of the facts and what we are saying is that about 70% of the private clinics in Athens are owned by a company related to the Prime Minister's entourage. It's also well known for those who want to see the truth that ambulances are a new business. Now, for three years, there are private companies that transport patients, which means that if you don't have money, you will die without an ambulance, as people are dying in Greece today. This means that, again, a private company wants to take over all this work. It's too much money.
