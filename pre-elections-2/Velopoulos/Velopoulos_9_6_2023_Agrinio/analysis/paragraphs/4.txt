I would also like to comment on the Prime Minister's statement, which is now being used for blackmail. He claims to want self-reliance, but that is a lie. The truth is that he wants hegemony so he can manipulate the Constitution to his liking. The rest of his talk about fear of losing self-reliance is just a ploy to scare Greeks into voting for his party. We are completely against this, as democracy cannot coexist with blackmail. Furthermore, I must tell the Prime Minister that if he wants to rule with 180 MPs and turn Greece into Syria, we will continue to hold elections until the end of time. I find his desire to become a ruler again unthinkable.
