I also have to say something that has escaped our attention. The Prime Minister is anxious about how New Democracy will fare in Northern Greece, as demonstrated by the fact that he has sent the so-called right-wing "patriots" Voridis and Georgiades there. They want them to worship Adonis on Mount Athos. He can be in the meteor, he can send it, and I know the Buddha temple is capable of doing anything just to steal and instrumentalize the Christian faith. I am ashamed of all this, just as I am ashamed of the fact that Borides went to convince the Macedonians that the New Republic will not betray Macedonia, when in fact it betrays it every day. Never mind, we leave them in their misery and continue the tour. It is a given that Macedonia supports the Greek Solution, and the panic shows, but you can't do patriotic politics with so-called patriots.
