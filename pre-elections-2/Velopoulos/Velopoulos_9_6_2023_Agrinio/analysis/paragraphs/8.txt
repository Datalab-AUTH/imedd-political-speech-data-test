As for the story with SYRIZA and the MP who declared himself a Turk, another story involving SYRIZA, PASOK, and New Democracy is that it has been known for decades that the consulate determines the fate of Muslim MPs. Unfortunately, in Thrace, it assists and this is known. If New Democracy truly declares itself patriotic and wants to prove it, all it can do is convince us not to slander, insult, or expose SYRIZA and tear down the consulate. It is easy to do this after we diplomatically withdraw ours from Smyrna; we have the right to demand the removal of the consulate from Komotini. This will end the cancer called consulate and not the tales of New Democracy that they have MPs like Filis who suddenly remembered his own again. He had said that there is no genocide of the Pontians, but they are voted for by the Pontians. Syriza now says that they are Turkish and so on. I will not comment on it. Philis can say whatever he wants, but he needs to be serious when speaking on national issues. That's all. If you have questions, I am ready to answer.
