I would like to thank all of you for being here today. We are on the third day of the tour, in Ioannina.

I would like to start with current affairs, specifically what I heard this morning from the Greek Prime Minister. The Greek Prime Minister is continuing his brutal blackmail, threatening elections until the sun goes down because he wants to be the ruler of the country. His purpose, as I have said before, is to have 180 MPs so that he can behave as he pleases and do whatever he wants without asking anyone. He will be self-reliant anyway, and everyone knows it. He seeks hegemony over 180 MPs so he can authoritatively define his decisions and enforce them. The Greek solution is contrary to this logic. We believe that blackmail through successive elections is a product of weakness and a willingness to impose, and it is dangerous for the country, costing 100 million euros per election. I am not adding the other costs. We do not have the money, Prime Minister. Everything is given on loan, and we cannot waste money on the whim of the Greek Prime Minister.

He said, of course, that he does not cooperate with the other parties on his right. He said it like that. Let me remind him that, in any case, New Democracy is neither his shop nor the New Democracy party. It is the river, it is PASOK, and whatever political straggler there was that he picked up, he made a hodgepodge of a party without an ideology, with the consequence that what was left was the New Democracy that everyone knew.

In relation to health and everything that has been going on since the story of Mr. Spiritual, I insist that no one is willing to resolve the health problem. No one is talking about the pathologies, apart from the attempt at privatization that Mr. Mitsotakis wants to impose because there are interests in his entourage that want to privatize healthcare. The fairytale he is now selling about recruitment, along with the investment he wants to make in public health, is a fairytale he never fulfilled.

During the pandemic, he told us that no more ICUs were needed because he had conducted studies. Now, suddenly, he is going to rebuild public health.

But nobody talks about the constant distribution of buffets and envelopes. Nobody mentions that the offices of MPs have turned into waiting rooms for patients who, out of desperation, are constantly seeking a bed or a buffet. Thus, the voter is held hostage and forced to vote for a particular MP who has taken away their obvious right to healthcare. Healthcare, health, and medication should be provided free of charge to the Greek people, and they should not have to ask for a buffet. Nobody dares to speak about the envelopes, even though we all know they exist in the medical field.

No government dares to touch this issue, as the logic of the parties in power is the same. And I will put it bluntly, if you don't have money, you will die on the street. This logic does not sit well with us. We think it is inhumane, brutal, and anti-Christian, but above all, it is inhumane and brutal.

What is particularly striking is that today the Prime Minister from Oraiokastro has remembered Orthodoxy. This is the same Prime Minister who closed churches, banned the epitaph, banned Holy Communion, and assisted some members of the church in this direction. Today, he wants to convince us that he has become religious, remembering Orthodoxy decades later. Let us remind him that Orthodoxy unites. Sometimes the mistakes of priests and some individuals in the church can be divisive, but this cannot be the subject of political controversy. It cannot be fished through the murky waters of voters, like the minister who is instrumentalizing this and even sending Adonis Georgiades to Mount Athos, I understand. It's time for Adonis to make a pilgrimage to Mount Athos too. After all, the Prime Minister hasn't been there for 40 years.

Also, no TV channel that I know of, at least none, has addressed the issue of the mafia execution in an armored car. I insist on this not because I have anything against Mr. Alafouzos. I personally don't care about Mr. Alafouzos, but the involvement of a man with such a story really reminds me of Venezuela and Cosa Nostra. And it's not the first incident. There have been countless assassinations in the last two months. The interconnectedness between night mafiosos, professional killers, hired killers, people who own channels, shipowners, and political figures in the prime minister's entourage is a given.

There is no prosecutor in the country. I don't trust the judiciary, as I have never trusted it, because it is controlled and we all know it very well.

That is why we are asking the Greek people for their vote, so that we can provide the obvious: public healthcare, free of charge to all Greeks; the justice that all Greeks are asking for; but above all, I would say, the dignity that they have been deprived of.

Also, a second issue is the statement of Mrs Lena Divanis, who is a professor of law in Athens. She said, "I left the university because they sell grades." Mrs Divanis denounced the selling of degrees in universities. No smoke was raised. No one spoke, no one mentioned. We are talking about Greek universities where professors are selling grades and taking money. This is the state of the new democracy. This is the state of the power parties. A rotten, corrupt state, and when something happens, they all cover it up together because they are all corrupt anyway.

I must also say that regarding the Prime Minister's statements about the new government after the elections, the Prime Minister said the following incomprehensible thing: "As far as the new cabinet is concerned, as long as citizens always trust us, there will be a rotation of government positions." I imagine that the people of Ioannina, my relatives in Pella who do not know English, understand what rotation means. This is where the Prime Minister is addressing himself, because he does not know where he is addressing. He also said, "There will be a lot of women." Of course, let me remind the Greek Prime Minister that before the elections, 2 months prior, he had promised a small government, talking about 10, 20 deputies... ministers? The 20 became 55, it could become 105. As sincere as he was then, he is as sincere now because he has learned to lie and that is the worst of all.

As for his personal bet for his next term, on healthcare, I said we don't believe it because the Prime Minister simply doesn't want public healthcare. His entourage is comfortable with private healthcare, and I've said a lot about private ambulances. Nobody is talking about this, and I have said about the clinics controlled by a particular company in Athens, most of which are in the interests of the Prime Minister's entourage, and nobody has said this either because they do not want the Greek solution. That is why the Prime Minister is doing everything possible to ensure that there is no Greek solution in the next Parliament.

He tried it in 2019 and, to put it politically, he got his ass kicked. Now he's going to get the same thing. It's a given. The Greek people know very well what I am saying.

But I would like to address a statement made by Mrs. Bakoyannis. Her crude blackmail of Pomaks in Rhodope is truly unbelievable. Of course, the family is accustomed to blackmail. The Prime Minister is also engaging in blackmail by threatening to hold another election if he is not a ruler with 180 MPs. Mrs. Bakoyannis went to the Pomaks and blackmailed them while simultaneously luring them to vote for New Democracy. She even promised 1000 positions, specifically 1000 border guard positions in the prefecture of Rodopi. This is racist and unconstitutional. You cannot simply select someone from a law and make them a border guard. All of this demonstrates that, in addition to the panic that characterizes them, this family does not understand what good governance of the country means. I say this bluntly.

Of course, Mrs Bakoyannis is the long arm of Turkey. I repeat, Mrs Bakoyannis is the long arm of Turkey. I did not say that. There is a video of Adonis Georgiades from a few years ago, where he says it the way I am telling you, that she is the long arm of Turkey. And these people are now sitting in chairs with each other, forming a coalition, cooperating. And they are exposing the country internationally. The Greek people need to understand a few basic things. If New Democracy was really a patriotic party, as the prime minister says, "we are patriots in deeds, not in words," it should have closed the consulate in Komotini.

It should have already been closed. We should not argue with SYRIZA about who is more or less philotourist. Both parties, along with PASOK, are philotourks. Why? Because they put people on the ballot papers who have made pro-Turkish statements and have declared themselves to be Turkish. This whole story proves that all three parties are philotourks because they want votes from those who declare themselves Turkish. Fortunately, there are few of them in Thrace. However, to end the story of the cancer, we must end the story of the consulate in Komotini.

I saved the tales of the economy for last. Today, Fitch shattered the Greek Prime Minister's myths about the Greek economy being upgraded. It left us in the category of rubbish, just as the economic policy of the New Democracy is rubbish. I say rubbish because Greece is the only country in the European Union with twice as many indirect taxes as direct taxes. Greece, I repeat, and the Greek seafarers, the shipowners, the well-known shipowners, contribute very little, infinitesimally little, in terms of taxes. The poorest strata of the country bear the biggest burden of EUR 57 billion a year in taxes. The new democracy has made cuts, but in the wrong direction.

If the Prime Minister really wants to prove that he is pursuing serious economic policy, he should do what we tell him to do: implement a 15% flat tax with no presumptions, no receipts, and no exceptions. Everything that generates income or expenses should be taxed at 15%. I don't understand why the electricity I pay, which already includes VAT, should not be considered an expense. All utility bills, including coffee and cigarettes, should be considered expenses. The state should not act as a headhunter of businessmen, employees, and individuals if it wants to collect VAT. A horizontal tax of 15% is the best solution, and we have been proposing it for years. However, nobody listens because it benefits them to avoid taxes, tax evasion, and bureaucracy. This is how you solve problems and move forward.

And two issues from the local community, of course, concern the whole of Greece. The first one, in particular, is the TOEB. It is unacceptable that in a country that imports countless agricultural products, similar to those of other countries, the TOEB should turn off the water to the farmers because they owe electricity. It is known that the big oligarchs never dare to turn off the electricity, no matter if they owe hundreds of millions of euros. It is unacceptable for a government, a state, not to understand that the farmer can and must feed the rest of the Greeks by creating wealth and producing goods. It is miserable and wretched to cut the debts, loans, and taxes of all the shipowners and oligarchs and not do the same for the farmers, livestock farmers, and fishermen. I say this so that you understand, the TOEB is a very difficult story. It happens all over Greece, but the government has been sleeping the sleep of the law for many, many years. The New Democracy is not interested in the farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. They don't care about the wage earner or the pensioner. They only care about their politicians, their friends, and the oligarchs who earn billions of euros.

And I saved a local story for last. I hope I am mistaken, as I have mentioned before, but I have been informed that the district governor and the mayor - I am not certain, so as to avoid any mistakes - intend to shut down the company that links the island to the lake and replace it with some other boats, belonging to their friends, which would financially ruin 20 families. This is supposedly based on a law from 1971. It is a peculiar story that I have been investigating for quite some time.

The local press strangely does not mention it. It is like the press of the big channels in Athens that did not mention anything about Alafouzos.

I don't understand what the connection is. Isn't that the point? Are 20 families having trouble on the island because someone decided to go into business for themselves? Are they in partnership? I don't know. Maybe it's unintentional. Is it the county or the municipality, if the municipality is involved? Do you know what the difference is between the Greek solution and the other parties? We dare to name names, which no one did for the story of Mr. Alafouzos, who maybe coincidentally gave his armored car to a hired killer. It may be a coincidence, but the prosecutor didn't call him for an explanation.

The same thing is happening all over Greece: a corrupt and rotten state in which the citizens suffer. Therefore, we ask for the vote of the Greek people on June 25. Our goal is to make Greeks proud and rich by cutting off the bloated state of Athens and the individuals who earn 7, 8, or even 10 thousand euros per month. We do not need partisan praetorians; we need to give back to the poor Greek citizens, pensioners, private employees, and civil servants.

These are not just words, but the struggle that we fight every day and will continue to do so, despite the attacks we receive and the false, slanderous articles in the New Democracy media. For example, this morning I will close by mentioning the New Democracy's non-paper from last night at 10 o'clock. Listen. My statement against the mobsters and all of them will be released this afternoon. It will not be shown on any national channel or carried by anyone, yet at 10 o'clock at night, a non-paper comes out claiming that the Greek Solution has a candidate from the southern sector running to put up Mr. Sotiri Juma. False.

The candidate asked to leave the electoral seat in a letter, citing her inability to balance her responsibilities as a mother of two young children with parliamentary duties. She expressed a desire to remain involved in the party's organizing efforts and fight alongside them. We accepted her decision. However, despite her press release informing us of her intentions, the media outlets of New Democracy used this as an opportunity to spread lies and speculate against us.

This is the new democracy. This is the party of filth. The sewer. And I say this because of the political sewer and the filth that we cannot tolerate, as it is no longer just an ideological difference between us, but a human difference. It is a matter of dignity. They do not have it, we do, and I will stop here. If you have any questions, I am available.
