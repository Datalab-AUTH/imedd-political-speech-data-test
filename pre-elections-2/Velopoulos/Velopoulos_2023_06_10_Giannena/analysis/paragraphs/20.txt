If the Prime Minister really wants to prove that he is pursuing serious economic policy, he should do what we tell him to do: implement a 15% flat tax with no presumptions, no receipts, and no exceptions. Everything that generates income or expenses should be taxed at 15%. I don't understand why the electricity I pay, which already includes VAT, should not be considered an expense. All utility bills, including coffee and cigarettes, should be considered expenses. The state should not act as a headhunter of businessmen, employees, and individuals if it wants to collect VAT. A horizontal tax of 15% is the best solution, and we have been proposing it for years. However, nobody listens because it benefits them to avoid taxes, tax evasion, and bureaucracy. This is how you solve problems and move forward.
