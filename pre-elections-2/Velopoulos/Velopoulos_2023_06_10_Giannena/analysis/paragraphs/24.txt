I don't understand what the connection is. Isn't that the point? Are 20 families having trouble on the island because someone decided to go into business for themselves? Are they in partnership? I don't know. Maybe it's unintentional. Is it the county or the municipality, if the municipality is involved? Do you know what the difference is between the Greek solution and the other parties? We dare to name names, which no one did for the story of Mr. Alafouzos, who maybe coincidentally gave his armored car to a hired killer. It may be a coincidence, but the prosecutor didn't call him for an explanation.
