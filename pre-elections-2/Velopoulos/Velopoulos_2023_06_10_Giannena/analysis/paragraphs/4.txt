In relation to health and everything that has been going on since the story of Mr. Spiritual, I insist that no one is willing to resolve the health problem. No one is talking about the pathologies, apart from the attempt at privatization that Mr. Mitsotakis wants to impose because there are interests in his entourage that want to privatize healthcare. The fairytale he is now selling about recruitment, along with the investment he wants to make in public health, is a fairytale he never fulfilled.
