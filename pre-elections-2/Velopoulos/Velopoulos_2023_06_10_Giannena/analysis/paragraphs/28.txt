This is the new democracy. This is the party of filth. The sewer. And I say this because of the political sewer and the filth that we cannot tolerate, as it is no longer just an ideological difference between us, but a human difference. It is a matter of dignity. They do not have it, we do, and I will stop here. If you have any questions, I am available.
