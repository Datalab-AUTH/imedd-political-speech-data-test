I saved the tales of the economy for last. Today, Fitch shattered the Greek Prime Minister's myths about the Greek economy being upgraded. It left us in the category of rubbish, just as the economic policy of the New Democracy is rubbish. I say rubbish because Greece is the only country in the European Union with twice as many indirect taxes as direct taxes. Greece, I repeat, and the Greek seafarers, the shipowners, the well-known shipowners, contribute very little, infinitesimally little, in terms of taxes. The poorest strata of the country bear the biggest burden of EUR 57 billion a year in taxes. The new democracy has made cuts, but in the wrong direction.
