These are not just words, but the struggle that we fight every day and will continue to do so, despite the attacks we receive and the false, slanderous articles in the New Democracy media. For example, this morning I will close by mentioning the New Democracy's non-paper from last night at 10 o'clock. Listen. My statement against the mobsters and all of them will be released this afternoon. It will not be shown on any national channel or carried by anyone, yet at 10 o'clock at night, a non-paper comes out claiming that the Greek Solution has a candidate from the southern sector running to put up Mr. Sotiri Juma. False.
