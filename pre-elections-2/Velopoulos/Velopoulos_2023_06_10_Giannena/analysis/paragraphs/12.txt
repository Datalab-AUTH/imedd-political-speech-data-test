Also, a second issue is the statement of Mrs Lena Divanis, who is a professor of law in Athens. She said, "I left the university because they sell grades." Mrs Divanis denounced the selling of degrees in universities. No smoke was raised. No one spoke, no one mentioned. We are talking about Greek universities where professors are selling grades and taking money. This is the state of the new democracy. This is the state of the power parties. A rotten, corrupt state, and when something happens, they all cover it up together because they are all corrupt anyway.
