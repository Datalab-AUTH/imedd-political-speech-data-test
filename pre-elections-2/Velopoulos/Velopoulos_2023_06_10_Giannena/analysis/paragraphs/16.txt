But I would like to address a statement made by Mrs. Bakoyannis. Her crude blackmail of Pomaks in Rhodope is truly unbelievable. Of course, the family is accustomed to blackmail. The Prime Minister is also engaging in blackmail by threatening to hold another election if he is not a ruler with 180 MPs. Mrs. Bakoyannis went to the Pomaks and blackmailed them while simultaneously luring them to vote for New Democracy. She even promised 1000 positions, specifically 1000 border guard positions in the prefecture of Rodopi. This is racist and unconstitutional. You cannot simply select someone from a law and make them a border guard. All of this demonstrates that, in addition to the panic that characterizes them, this family does not understand what good governance of the country means. I say this bluntly.
