What is particularly striking is that today the Prime Minister from Oraiokastro has remembered Orthodoxy. This is the same Prime Minister who closed churches, banned the epitaph, banned Holy Communion, and assisted some members of the church in this direction. Today, he wants to convince us that he has become religious, remembering Orthodoxy decades later. Let us remind him that Orthodoxy unites. Sometimes the mistakes of priests and some individuals in the church can be divisive, but this cannot be the subject of political controversy. It cannot be fished through the murky waters of voters, like the minister who is instrumentalizing this and even sending Adonis Georgiades to Mount Athos, I understand. It's time for Adonis to make a pilgrimage to Mount Athos too. After all, the Prime Minister hasn't been there for 40 years.
