The same thing is happening all over Greece: a corrupt and rotten state in which the citizens suffer. Therefore, we ask for the vote of the Greek people on June 25. Our goal is to make Greeks proud and rich by cutting off the bloated state of Athens and the individuals who earn 7, 8, or even 10 thousand euros per month. We do not need partisan praetorians; we need to give back to the poor Greek citizens, pensioners, private employees, and civil servants.
