And two issues from the local community, of course, concern the whole of Greece. The first one, in particular, is the TOEB. It is unacceptable that in a country that imports countless agricultural products, similar to those of other countries, the TOEB should turn off the water to the farmers because they owe electricity. It is known that the big oligarchs never dare to turn off the electricity, no matter if they owe hundreds of millions of euros. It is unacceptable for a government, a state, not to understand that the farmer can and must feed the rest of the Greeks by creating wealth and producing goods. It is miserable and wretched to cut the debts, loans, and taxes of all the shipowners and oligarchs and not do the same for the farmers, livestock farmers, and fishermen. I say this so that you understand, the TOEB is a very difficult story. It happens all over Greece, but the government has been sleeping the sleep of the law for many, many years. The New Democracy is not interested in the farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. They don't care about the wage earner or the pensioner. They only care about their politicians, their friends, and the oligarchs who earn billions of euros.
