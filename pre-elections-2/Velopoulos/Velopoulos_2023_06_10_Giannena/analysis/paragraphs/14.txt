As for his personal bet for his next term, on healthcare, I said we don't believe it because the Prime Minister simply doesn't want public healthcare. His entourage is comfortable with private healthcare, and I've said a lot about private ambulances. Nobody is talking about this, and I have said about the clinics controlled by a particular company in Athens, most of which are in the interests of the Prime Minister's entourage, and nobody has said this either because they do not want the Greek solution. That is why the Prime Minister is doing everything possible to ensure that there is no Greek solution in the next Parliament.
