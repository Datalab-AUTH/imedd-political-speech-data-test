And I saved a local story for last. I hope I am mistaken, as I have mentioned before, but I have been informed that the district governor and the mayor - I am not certain, so as to avoid any mistakes - intend to shut down the company that links the island to the lake and replace it with some other boats, belonging to their friends, which would financially ruin 20 families. This is supposedly based on a law from 1971. It is a peculiar story that I have been investigating for quite some time.
