But nobody talks about the constant distribution of buffets and envelopes. Nobody mentions that the offices of MPs have turned into waiting rooms for patients who, out of desperation, are constantly seeking a bed or a buffet. Thus, the voter is held hostage and forced to vote for a particular MP who has taken away their obvious right to healthcare. Healthcare, health, and medication should be provided free of charge to the Greek people, and they should not have to ask for a buffet. Nobody dares to speak about the envelopes, even though we all know they exist in the medical field.
