Also, no TV channel that I know of, at least none, has addressed the issue of the mafia execution in an armored car. I insist on this not because I have anything against Mr. Alafouzos. I personally don't care about Mr. Alafouzos, but the involvement of a man with such a story really reminds me of Venezuela and Cosa Nostra. And it's not the first incident. There have been countless assassinations in the last two months. The interconnectedness between night mafiosos, professional killers, hired killers, people who own channels, shipowners, and political figures in the prime minister's entourage is a given.
