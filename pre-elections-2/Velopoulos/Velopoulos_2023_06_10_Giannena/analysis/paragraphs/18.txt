It should have already been closed. We should not argue with SYRIZA about who is more or less philotourist. Both parties, along with PASOK, are philotourks. Why? Because they put people on the ballot papers who have made pro-Turkish statements and have declared themselves to be Turkish. This whole story proves that all three parties are philotourks because they want votes from those who declare themselves Turkish. Fortunately, there are few of them in Thrace. However, to end the story of the cancer, we must end the story of the consulate in Komotini.
