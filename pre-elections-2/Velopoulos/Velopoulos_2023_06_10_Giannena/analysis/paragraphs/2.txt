I would like to start with current affairs, specifically what I heard this morning from the Greek Prime Minister. The Greek Prime Minister is continuing his brutal blackmail, threatening elections until the sun goes down because he wants to be the ruler of the country. His purpose, as I have said before, is to have 180 MPs so that he can behave as he pleases and do whatever he wants without asking anyone. He will be self-reliant anyway, and everyone knows it. He seeks hegemony over 180 MPs so he can authoritatively define his decisions and enforce them. The Greek solution is contrary to this logic. We believe that blackmail through successive elections is a product of weakness and a willingness to impose, and it is dangerous for the country, costing 100 million euros per election. I am not adding the other costs. We do not have the money, Prime Minister. Everything is given on loan, and we cannot waste money on the whim of the Greek Prime Minister.
