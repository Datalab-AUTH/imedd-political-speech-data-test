I must also say that regarding the Prime Minister's statements about the new government after the elections, the Prime Minister said the following incomprehensible thing: "As far as the new cabinet is concerned, as long as citizens always trust us, there will be a rotation of government positions." I imagine that the people of Ioannina, my relatives in Pella who do not know English, understand what rotation means. This is where the Prime Minister is addressing himself, because he does not know where he is addressing. He also said, "There will be a lot of women." Of course, let me remind the Greek Prime Minister that before the elections, 2 months prior, he had promised a small government, talking about 10, 20 deputies... ministers? The 20 became 55, it could become 105. As sincere as he was then, he is as sincere now because he has learned to lie and that is the worst of all.
