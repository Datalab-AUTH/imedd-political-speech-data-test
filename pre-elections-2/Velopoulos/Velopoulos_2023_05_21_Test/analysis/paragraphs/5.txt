But I have to say two or three things, which I think are very important on the issue of Albania. The special forces that arrested Beleri were trained by the Greek army, the Albanian special forces. In other words, look at the tragedy that our country is going through, the Albanian special forces were trained by Greek officers. Greek officers trained those murderers of Katsifa, Gumas, Beleri, Kokavesi and all those of the Kola who perished, were persecuted, hunted by the Albanian regime. We ask the Greek government, even today, to take initiatives and actions. To punish the fascist Rama because the Greek presence in Northern Epirus is not a small presence of a few years. It is centuries of millennia. We therefore call on the Prime Minister and the other political leaders to leave the election period tomorrow, so to speak. And take the plane that is taking rides. The Prime Minister's motor car and go to Tirana. All the political leaders. Ask to see Rama, ask to see Beleri in jail. It's a proposal. I am afraid that Tsipras, Mr Androulakis and the others will evaluate the proposal in the usual way. It is better to run around the villages within quotes and be applauded by the other party member than to do their national duty. The first act a serious country can do is this. Come close to the issue.
