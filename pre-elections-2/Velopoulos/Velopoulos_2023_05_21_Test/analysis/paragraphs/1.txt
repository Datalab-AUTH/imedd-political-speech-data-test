I would like to thank you for being here today and wish a happy birthday to the Greek mother and to every mother. And why do I say this? We all know the important role that every mother plays and plays. We trust the Greek mother, we believe in the Greek mother and that is why we honour her. And we must honour her as Greeks from ancient times until today and we must continue on exactly the same path.
