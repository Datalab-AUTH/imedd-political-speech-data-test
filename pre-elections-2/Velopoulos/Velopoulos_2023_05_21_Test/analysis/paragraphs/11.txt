I would also say that if truly Greek solution is given the opportunity to govern. She does not have to do many things. I have said it before. We will not invent America. The first thing we will do is potentially operate the lignites in the region. There are ways, there are special filters, our own experts in the we submitted a whole study to the House. CCPC collected this method anyway, I'm not an expert of all, but I'm reading and learning some things. Which has to do with blast furnaces and how you can have no pollutants at all, but the big lie and I'm afraid that here in Kozani they don't know it is that Greece even now has low pollutants, the lowest in Europe. 5.3 compared to other countries that have 15 2010, which means that we can operate the lignites. And on the other hand? We send our lignite, primarily to Skopje, a few kilometres away from the border. There is an old power and lignite plant working there. By the Scopian brothers of Mr Mitsotakis, Mr Tsipras and Mr Androulakis. That is what they are called and Zaev called his brother Mr Mitsotakis. And he sends the pollutants to Western Macedonia, the state of Skopje. What kind of pollution is this? What is this excuse really that can be valid to tell you that I want to protect the environment, but at the same time I want Northern Greece to be filled with pollutants.
