I say it as simply as I can and I hope it is understandable. The Greek solution did not come to Greece because it just wants to be still reactionary like the rest of the pieces. We are a governing party, a party that can govern. 400 pages of program when New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK together their programs are about 85 pages of all three together and they are not ashamed and rather for costing programs which when I really saw it I who am not the economist huge. I almost fell out of my chair. From laughing. Because it's a laughing matter but the people, the Greek people and various Greeks need to understand something. That we are the only political force in the last 100 years since Macedonia was liberated and something from the 12 that comes from the bowels of Macedonia and Northern Greece. Good at least for the philanthropy that Macedonians have to support the effort of the Greek solution. Don't behave as they did.
