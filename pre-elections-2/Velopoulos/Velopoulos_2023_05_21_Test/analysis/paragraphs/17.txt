In previous decades as slaves of a state, which is 40,000 citizens in Athens of rodents. Not all of Athens 40,000 rodents and I can cite infinite arguments to prove it.2300 workers I will get tired of saying it for this says nothing Androulakis, Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis for their own comfortable. 2300 people and another 5500 together, all together all together all appointed unqualified, getting salaries of over 5k to 12k each individually. That money is about 1-1 201 billion 200 million and that's who I'm going to fire. I say it bluntly. We're going to fire them, it's not possible. It is unworthy of merit 2300 people to be paid â‚¬10,000 in independent authorities that are illegal, because our Constitution says 5 and we have 37. These people don't work for the country, they work for their parties. I say this so you can understand where you can make a cut, but the 3 of them don't speak because they are their own children. They appointed them how can you remove a press from there that you appointed? And what do they say I tell you we borrow and give borrow and give by increasing the debt.
