And here. Let's go a little bit to the economy, although I was told to talk about the partnerships, you know I laugh at Mr. Androulakis, who one day says jail and the next day says release. So it is unbelievable what is happening. And I will say something that may sound a little strange, and all of Athens knows it, Athens is crying about this story. That the interceptions have given Mr Mitsotakis weapons in his quiver in relation to political opponents. I hope Androulakis does not behave in the following arrivals because of this. I hope so wholeheartedly because if a political leader is held hostage by wiretapping, then our democracy is finished.
