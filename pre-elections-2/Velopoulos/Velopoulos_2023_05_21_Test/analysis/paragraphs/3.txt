We had a second incident, the press conference. It really makes me happy, on the one hand you can be worried for a while, but on the other hand you are happy about the panic of the New Democracy. You know they were supposed to be here to channel TV Flash but suddenly they told us they don't have a camera. Okay, these things happen. Yes, we were told they don't have a camera if I'm not mistaken. They informed me a little while ago, but the Network is coming; the Kastoria Network, which is further away from Kozani. I don't know, it may be coincidences like that, but recurring coincidences didn't just happen here and in Crete where we went something similar, it happened okay, it can happen. It doesn't matter. Anyway, we knew it was a mountain for us when you're dealing with the state of Athens, the water-headed state. It makes sense that they would deal with it with all the resources they have, even if they are dirty and we've been dealing with it intensely for the last two months for the last four years. That's why in the debate, as you saw on the debate, I don't mince my words and we don't mince our words, they told the journalists that I thank the Greek people very much today for bringing me here because we were never shown on Mega not even once for 4 years on Sky at all on STAR at all. And in the others hardly ever. If we were given the opportunity to communicate our messages, we are sure that the battle would have been at least on equal terms.
