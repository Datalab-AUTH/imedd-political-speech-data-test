I apologize, but that's my point when Stavroulakis comes out and says he's going to do 150,000 new homes. And he estimates the cost at 1.1 billion euros, so a house of 7200 euros, how can that be? A political leader who simply does not know prep school. Subtraction, division, multiplication, addition we have nothing with man. But enough of lying. And he's even telling us again the familiar "I'll get the money from the recovery fund". The Recovery Fund is for the recovery of the economy. It's not to make houses and showers. Better to give the Greek a job with two 3000€ a month so that he can pay the rent on 700€ than to give him the duvet and be unemployed. This is the different philosophy that the Greek Solution has. We can produce wealth by creating jobs. They borrow money and put the country in debt without producing wealth and without being able to honour Greece to make it better. I say this in very simple terms because I really could not understand how you can make 150,000 new houses with 1.1 billion nor can you do it with 4 billion. It is not possible with 7000 I am 30,000 euros a house unless Mr Androulakis lives in a house with one room and a toilet. You can do it for 10 grand in a rented house.
