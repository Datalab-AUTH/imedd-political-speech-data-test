The second one I have already instructed the Greek solution through the person in charge to our MEP to ask for the freezing of all Community funds to Albania. All. Albania gets too much from the European Union with the vote of Greece. Because Greece has the right to veto. So we ask the Greek government to veto as a second option. In relation to what Rama is doing. Veto that Rama's Albanians do not get even 1â‚¬, our issue is not the Albanians as citizens, but Rama whose logic has been dominated by an anti-Hellenic psyche for decades. His behaviour is also a matter of science, because practically half of his mother is a Greek redneck by birth. He himself has studied in Greece, has been hosted many, many times, but he has a hatred that many cannot justify. Of course, as the President of a drug state, because he is the President of a drug state, I think that what Greece should do is what the Greek solution is to stop all funding to Albania.
