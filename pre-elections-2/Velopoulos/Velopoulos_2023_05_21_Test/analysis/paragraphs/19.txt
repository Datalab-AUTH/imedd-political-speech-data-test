If you have any questions I am at your disposal to answer them. And I hope. With the next government, don't pay 15€ all the way to Thessaloniki with the tolls, because the Kozanians don't have a brain. From next year they will put the toll on your route you will pay 15-30€ to commute. Enjoy your vote, I wish that on 21 May as Macedonians you will stand up and answer with a big no to them and a big yes to the Greek Solution.
