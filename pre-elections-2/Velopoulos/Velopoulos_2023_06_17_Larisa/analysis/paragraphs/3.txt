We have to make it clear in our minds that Europe is not going to help us. At some point, we have to understand that if Europe wanted to help us, it would have ended this issue of illegal immigration of people coming from different places. The oxymoron in the story is the Greek politicians. They don't understand it and they keep invoking Europe. If Europe wanted to solve the problem, it would have helped Italy and Spain, which have a terrible problem with Morocco. If we do not solve it ourselves, we will face colonization and replacement of the Greek population that Greece has never seen before. What frightens me most is the attempt to cultivate a guilt syndrome in us Greeks for the shipwreck. It was not the fault of the Greeks. The shipwreck and the loss of human lives were not the fault of any of us. Those who were to blame, those who are to blame are mainly those who do not take measures to deter entry and, above all, to make our country attractive as a destination.
