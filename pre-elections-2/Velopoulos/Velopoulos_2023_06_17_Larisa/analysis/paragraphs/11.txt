However, the Prime Minister himself, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty, asked for Muslim children in Thrace to be taught in the Turkish language. She and Mrs Kerameos are applying this same logic to the children, who according to the Lausanne Treaty, we are obliged to teach Quran only in Arabic. On the other hand, the same party opened a mosque in Kos and Rhodes, while our country is not obliged to do so. Additionally, the party has included Turkish parliamentary candidates from New Democracy, SYRIZA, and PASOK, who talk to the Consulate and are sent by it. Let them stop their hypocrisy and do what we did. We put up a candidate who is a declared Greek, a Pomak with very good relations with the Orthodox Church. He raises the flag of the Blue and White and boos. The Pomaks, who are Greek ancient Agrians, are honored by this choice. We could have put someone with a connection to the consulate, but we do not play with national issues just to get 5,000 or 10,000 crosses or one more MP.
