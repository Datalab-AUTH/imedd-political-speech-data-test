I would like to dwell a little on Mr Tsipras' verbal mistake yesterday because New Democracy is used to turning verbal mistakes into flags. I will say to Mr Tsipras that the drinker gets drunk, the gambler loses, and the speaker is exposed. I do not know whether that was a verbal error about the Turkish minority in Thrace. I accept that. I do not want to believe that there is a Greek political leader who believes that there is a Turkish minority in Thrace. I find it unthinkable.
