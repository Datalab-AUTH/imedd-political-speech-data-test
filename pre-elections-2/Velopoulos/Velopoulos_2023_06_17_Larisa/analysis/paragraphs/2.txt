I would like to start with the news. I am confused by the political parties in the country. We have a tragedy with people suffering and unhappy, people drowning, and lives lost. The political personnel in the country are not discussing what we can do to prevent similar things from happening again. The prime minister is absent, but he says he will show up anyway. Today he was away for two or three days. I don't know where the man has been for these three days. I don't know the odd PM. The other parties have attempted to take advantage of human misery in a miserable way. We disagree with these choices. We believe that human suffering should not be abused, nor should it be used to become a grave robber or to bend over dead people. Unfortunately, they do. They do it because, quite simply, either through offshoots or relationships that these parties have with non-governmental organizations, agencies, and independent or semi-independent groups, they earn too many billions for their cronies and friends.
