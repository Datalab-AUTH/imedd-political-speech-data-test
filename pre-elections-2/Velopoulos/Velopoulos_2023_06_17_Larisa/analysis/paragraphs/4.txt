Our view, by definition, is deterrence, and deterrence is achieved, as I said yesterday and I will say again, with basic measures. First, you close down all non-governmental organizations. There is no reason for them to exist because they are well-organized businesses. They make billions of euros, either from people who give too much money for these NGOs to exist, or from states that finance them directly or indirectly with grants, or from individuals who want to alienate Europe's population. This is the logic and the view of Europeans and Greeks alike. Here, the idea that we need labor from Pakistanis, Afghans, and Bangladeshis, or that we have a demographic problem, as the Prime Minister says, and that we need to graft new arrivals of people into Greece, reminds me of the man who, when his tooth hurts, cuts off his head to solve his problem. By doing this, you are giving incentives to Greek families and Europeans to have children and not to bring in something that may not be able to be grafted, something that may not be easily assimilated, with the consequence that we see tragic images and situations in Europe from those who are not assimilated.
