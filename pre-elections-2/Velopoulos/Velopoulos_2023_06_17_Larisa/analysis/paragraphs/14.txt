This is so that some people in the prefecture of Larissa and Thessaly as a whole can understand that the Greek Solution is the solution to the country's problem, and the other is the problem. That is why I ask every family and every home for one vote. I ask all families to vote for us because there is a program and a solution. That is our view, our position, and we are unwavering. In that position, there is a solution, and we are the solution. On June 25, I ask for the vote of the Greek people for the Greek solution, for a solution to the country's problem.
