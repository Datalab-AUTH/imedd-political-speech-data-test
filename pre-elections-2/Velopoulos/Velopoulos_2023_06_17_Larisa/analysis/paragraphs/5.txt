I say this so that some people will understand that the second thing a serious state should do, apart from closing the houses, is to impose life sentences on slave traders. And when we say life sentences, they will never get out of there again. They will never see the sun again, not after 15 years, not after 18. They will never see the sun again for life. Slavers, whether on this side - and I'm talking about Greece - or if we push someone else on the other side that's coming.
