Another way, and I must point this out here, is to copy the Danish or even the German model. I could say a lot about this. Yesterday, I mentioned on a television channel to Mr Hatzinikolaou the ban on sending remittances better than they are in their countries, and he said to me, "it is not done, it is money that is given." So, therefore, I will not give money. I will give what I say instead of giving the Greek. I will give the Pakistani that is to go and buy food, buy clothes, not money. And dash that our money stays here. There are ways to ban money from leaving your country. Denmark, of course, has done what we have proposed since 2020 to the Greek government. A study proved that it could be much easier to get the money out and it could be much less to spend on hosting these people. Of course, accommodate what you want, not whoever comes in through the window of your house. The one who comes in through the window of your house may not be a guest, but I dimensionally say this to do what Denmark does has made agreements with North African countries and sends those who are not entitled to asylum or those who need to be told if they will get asylum these people to North African countries at an eleventh of the cost if they were in closed centres and subsidised in Denmark. We can do that too. But the people of the New Democracy, SYRIZA, and PASOK because they are intertwined and maybe even earning and many of them money we know in the Prime Minister's entourage Mrs. Lymperaki has some special connections with Open Society. People of PASOK of SYRIZA I would say are feeding on these funds. Not illegally, but in any case, in our view, unethically, because that is what is wrong that these bodies are doing.
