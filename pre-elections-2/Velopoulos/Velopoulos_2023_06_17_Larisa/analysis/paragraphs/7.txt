What we also have to do is deter, no more benefits. Greece cannot be an attractive place. When you give people benefits in Greece, they put up pictures on Facebook with 500 euros, 100 euros, or 50 euros. People in their areas see this and they have houses and telephones. But it is normal because they are also unhappy and poor and want to come here.
