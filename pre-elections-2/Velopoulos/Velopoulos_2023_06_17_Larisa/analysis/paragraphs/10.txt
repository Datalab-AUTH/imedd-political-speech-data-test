But I'm sorry that both parties are skimping on this issue by attempting, and I'm sure most major national stations will not broadcast this, to stop the information in relation to Mr. Alafuzos' relationships with armored cars, the Greek Mafia, hired guns, and assassins. Those of you who have been following what is happening are unbelievable. All the channels are trying to cover this story, and I think that some of the issues that came out and were blown up so much were done for one reason only: to darken the other issues involved - the oil smuggling, the underground economy, the black money, the connection of politicians and people around the Prime Minister's entourage with canal lords and hired killers. I say it like that. I don't want to comment further, in the sense that the judiciary has intervened and I cannot comment further. But what I can say is that the Prime Minister and the New Republic, in the house of the hanged man, they do not talk about rope.
