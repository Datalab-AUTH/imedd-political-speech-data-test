He has asked for 160 seats, he says to get for the next administration. I say all this because I want to close so as not to bore you. Because we have a political staff that is below the expectations and circumstances of the Greek people. We have a political staff that avoided having a debate. And they deliberately avoided it because once again they knew that they could not face the whole truth, because they have no proposals, they have no plan and, above all, they have no understanding of the real economy. We insist and give an example that I have in front of me. We had also submitted a study to Parliament, which was passed over, not everyone passed over and we said. If tomorrow morning and in the next six months photovoltaic panels are installed on the roofs of the houses of the houses, I stress the houses in 35% of the houses in Greece, the average household will pay at least 85%, that is, we will pay less electricity. So instead of subsidizing the photovoltaic systems on the roofs of the houses so that the Greeks can have autonomy of electricity or not pay any electricity at all, we subsidize the energy providers to the rich whom the citizen pays through the PPC with the ETMEAR so that the rich can become richer and the poor can become poorer. The study was submitted and I must tell you that based on this study our foreign exchange outflows each year for fuel purchases would be reduced by another EUR 1.8 billion. Because in order to have electricity in our house to have air conditioning, Greece spends EUR 1.8 billion in fuel inflows. That is natural gas, oil to run the engines year pipeline electricity generation 1.8 billion. Free electricity and earned 1.8 billion. The money is in the Recovery Fund. Other packages go through and they give it to the wind turbines and photovoltaics to bribe their friends and cronies.
