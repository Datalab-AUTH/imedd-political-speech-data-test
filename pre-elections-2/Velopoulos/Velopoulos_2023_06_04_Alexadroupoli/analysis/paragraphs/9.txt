And since we are talking about programs, let me read to you what the New Democracy ministers said about their infamous program. If they had a program, they would not have imposed such high taxes, of course. I have to say something. Mr. Mitsotakis claims he cut 50 taxes and left wages untouched. I suggest that the Greek Prime Minister take the salary he gives to Greek citizens and try to survive on it himself starting tomorrow morning. I recommend he enter the labor market and work for a month to see if he can survive on the salary he claims to have increased. If the wage increase Mr. Mitsotakis is talking about covers accuracy, electricity costs, and the cost of living, then he really has a problem understanding and comprehending the economic facts of the country. He has never struggled, and this is not my personal opinion, but the truth. It is one thing to struggle to survive and another for others to struggle for you to survive and live well.
