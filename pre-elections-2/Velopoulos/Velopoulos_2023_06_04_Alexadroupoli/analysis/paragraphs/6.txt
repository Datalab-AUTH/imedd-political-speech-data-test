For its part, the New Democracy has created a virtual reality with the well-paid media, the national media, and it is well known that the Greek Solution is not treated equally by the channels. It is a given; there is no need. We know how we struggle, we know that we have to deal with the dirty system of Athens Kolonaki, the mentality of the 40,000 people who are based and reside in Athens but who exploit the state budget, and all those shipowners who own the media. Hence, our anxiety for the elections on the 25th for one reason alone. It is an election, substantial elections. They are elections that will give the country or give the country a tomorrow that we envision. If the Greek Solution succeeds and gets more than 8%, it is certain that the self-reliance will end for the New Democracy and the other parties not to lose strength. This is Mr. Mitsotakis' problem. And that's why he put the executioner journalists within quotation marks, his own pistols to execute the character of the Greek Solution.
