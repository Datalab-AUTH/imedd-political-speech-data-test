And because I saw him raise the cloth of patriotism, he says that this Prime Minister is essentially a patriot and he put SYRIZA in the crosshairs for what happened in the prefecture of Rodopi. It is really unpatriotic to elect a SYRIZA MP who declares himself a Turk. I will tell him this. He has been a minister for decades, a prime minister for years, and he does not know what is happening in Thrace, nor does he know the role of the Consulate. If he and the others are so patriotic, why don't they do the obvious? Is it the fault of the MP who works as a Turk when the Consulate operates in this way, or is the consulate operating with this logic? Because when the tooth hurts, you don't cut the head off; you take out the tooth or heal the problem in the tooth. The only solution, Mr Mitsotakis, to prove that you are a patriot is to tear down the consulate from Komotini. Everything else is cheap patriotism. Full stop. Let us clarify the reasons for the existence of politicians and even a party that has a very good relationship with Mr Zaev, which even now, while we are talking about patriotism, still has the beggar in jail. Okay, let's be a little shorter. Our boot on the level of patriotism, because it really is small in the new democracy.
