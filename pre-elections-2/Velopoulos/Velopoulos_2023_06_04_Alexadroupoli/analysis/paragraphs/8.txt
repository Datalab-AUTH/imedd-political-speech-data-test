These people want to understand power, but they can't understand what it means to run a public administration and government. It is unacceptable to say these things, and it turns out that this party is a real media bubble. As long as they needed it, they were inflating it. We got it to 18%, 19%, 20% in the polls a long time ago, and among the deflate again, they attempted after the election to inflate it again. They are deflating it again. Why? When you're subject to the media and when you're held by a dirty black system, they're bound to do what they want. Can't they do what they want to us because we have no dependence on them? We are independent, really. And I mean what I say, and I say it as a provincial northerner.
