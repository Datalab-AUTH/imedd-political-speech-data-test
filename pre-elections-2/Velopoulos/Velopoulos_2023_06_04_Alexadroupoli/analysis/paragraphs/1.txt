I would like to thank you for being here again today. We talked again a short time ago and now we have returned to my favorite region and my favorite law that honors the Greek solution and all Greeks. I warmly thank them once again for their appreciation of the person, not mine, but the person that the Greek solution represents in the Greek parliament and the continuous struggle that we are fighting.
