I try to be as consistent as I can be. To be clear, I'll just say this: with lies, the Prime Minister won the election with the help of the media and stole the result. After the elections, the Greek people will bitterly regret choosing New Democracy if they do so again. I can prove when the minister is lying. The Prime Minister doesn't even know that there are auctions happening in Greece right now. He said there are not. He also doesn't know that the electronic auctions that Syriza legislated do not exist in any country in Europe. Not one. The Prime Minister says that the banks should help the citizens, but he knows that every day they charge Greeks €500 to transfer money to their children, and they only receive €15-20 in remittance. This doesn't happen in any other country in Europe. The Prime Minister also knows that the banks took about 70 billion euros from the Greek people and never returned it or taxed it. A Prime Minister like that doesn't deserve to govern Greece or the Greeks.
