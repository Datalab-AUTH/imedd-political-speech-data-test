We are carrying out a national project. We will not stop, we will persevere, we will continue. We will fight our battle and we will speak to the Greek people in the language of truth. It is not our concern, it is not our interest, their dirty palace. At some point, a smile at everyone's foolishness. I cannot listen to PASOK, New Democracy, and SYRIZA squabbling over the country's tax system. I find it truly disgusting. When there is a specific solution that we proposed to all the 15% horizontal tax and it ends tax evasion and tax avoidance ends the big problem of the country, they don't do it, and I will tell you why. It is time to speak the language of truth. If a product last year made €10, VAT is 24%, so the state was getting €2.4. This year when the product makes €20 with the same VAT, the state gets €4.8. That is how the state steals with indirect taxes. That is why we have had an increase in VAT revenue. It took 5 billion more at least distributed the one and a half billion and a half billion to the Greeks and thinks the Greeks are relieved. Aspirin for gangrene does not help, and whether these parties have programs does not help either. One can see this from the party of Androulakis who does not know what is happening to him, not as Androulakis his party. I imagine he knows what he's about; I have reservations about that, but it doesn't matter. When he says that he will tax multinationals, the basic rule of economics is that multinationals unfortunately are not taxed; they are not double-taxed.
