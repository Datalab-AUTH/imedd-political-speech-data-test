I would like to say that I am troubled by the various dealers and rodents in the public sector who, since last night, have attempted to smear the Greek solution. This is the tactic of New Democracy and the Ministry of Maximus, who pay the public because they have too much money. This means that they can take money from the state and give it to their rodents to do the dirty work in relation to what I said. We are talking about a coordinated character attack on the F-35. On a TV show, I expressed my doubts about the F-35 for many reasons, the most important being that I cannot consent without seeing a contract that a government signs for the next 5 years. It is the Greek people's money, and no one has the right to sign without knowing what they are receiving. So I said in this interview that we should say yes or no to the F-35 only after seeing the contract, and I stand by that. Some time ago, the New Republic site was talking about technical problems of the F-35 before their party decided to buy it. Another site of the New Republic published a bomb from Israel about the F-35 having serious problems. The US grounded many F-35s due to a problem in the ejection system of the pilots. That is, a few months ago, the New Republic sites were talking about problems concerning this particular weapon system. This made me cautious, and I repeat that I am cautious. If I don't see the type of aircraft, I am cautious, and it is my obligation because this purchase involves the Greek people's money.
