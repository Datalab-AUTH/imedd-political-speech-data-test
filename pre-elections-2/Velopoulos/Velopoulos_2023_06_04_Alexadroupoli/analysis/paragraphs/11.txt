I would also like to apologize since we're talking about numbers. I am joking, but these are really very difficult days we are going through. May I read what Mr Staikouras said about the New Democracy programme? Staikouras said the cost is 9 billion, Dakis MP said 8.9 billion on Real Fm, Plevris said 4 billion on Real Fm, Spanakis said 7 billion on Real Fm, Skylakakis said 5.5 billion on Sky, Skylakakis made another statement of 9 billion on Real Fm, M. Asimakopoulou said 9.1 billion, Economou said eight and a half billion. This is the program of New Democracy that ministers and deputies do not know how much it costs. Can they understand their mockery? They are the ones who govern and the Greek people voted for them by 41%. For hours and hours, I wonder at the new Greek who doesn't see the taxation. They don't see that there is no return on what they do in terms of income, and they don't want to understand the obvious that the one who murdered them nationally, socially, politically, economically cannot be their savior. Neither New Democracy, nor SYRIZA, nor PASOK can be the saviors of Greece.
