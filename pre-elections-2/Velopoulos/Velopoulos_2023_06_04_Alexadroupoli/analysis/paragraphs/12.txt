The saviors of Greece are those who can make specific cuts in the Greek economy and take specific actions, not through wind turbine fairy tales like in Dadia. Are they not ashamed to set up wind turbines in Dadia? Do they not feel ashamed to set up wind turbines and photovoltaics on Greek land so that their friends, the Germans, can take billions and pay energy providers with money subsidized by the Greek people through the PPC?
