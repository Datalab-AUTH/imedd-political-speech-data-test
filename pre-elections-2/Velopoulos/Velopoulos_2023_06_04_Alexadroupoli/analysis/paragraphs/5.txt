In closing, we are particularly cautious with the party of Zayef's false Macedonia. We are also cautious with the party of Siemens, Novartis, and the party of New Democracy, which has been directly assigned 10 billion euros. We are skeptical because all they know how to do is eat with golden spoons, drink the best wines with their friends, and leave the Greek people hungry. That is why I keep insisting on the necessity to stop lying. The New Democracy cannot talk about wage increases when it is a fact that due to the revaluations and the 15-20, 70-80, 80-90% of the conditions, the Greek people have become poorer. We insist on the thirteenth pension, the increase in OGA pensioners, IKA pensioners, and all pensioners. We insist that at some point, the New Democracy understands that it is good to feed its rodents the 2300 along with PASOK and SYRIZA Booleans in the independent authorities. But we will take this one billion euro and give it to the pensioner, the employee, and all those who toil daily to survive. We are now talking about survival, not subsistence. We have reached the limit of talking about survival and not living.
