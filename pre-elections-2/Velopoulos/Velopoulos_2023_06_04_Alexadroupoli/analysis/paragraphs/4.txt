But we, in the logic of the New Republic, have been writing posts about problems on the site for months. Today, it seems like rodents and hyenas are trying to assassinate the character of the Greek solution. We cannot say that we understand the panic of the New Democracy and their desire to govern independently, but we cannot understand the stench, the dirt, the mud, the stench, and above all, the sewer with which they are attempting to create character assassination of people. I say this bluntly. In closing, I would like to say that the Greek solution once again defends the national interest and not the interests of arms companies. We are defending the national interest. We are neither dealers nor do we have interests as a site or as a channel to take advertising from arms companies because the kickbacks are going somewhere.
