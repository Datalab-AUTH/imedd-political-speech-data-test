I am at everyone's disposal to say only one thing in front of me: some paintings. I don't know if you can show them. These paintings prove that PASOK, New Democracy, and Syriza are incapable of understanding that tourism is not a heavy industry. It proves how much money they leave based on what they say to ELSTAT, but also to responsible bodies involved in tourism. How much money are foreign tourists leaving in Greece? In Central Macedonia, the daily expenditure in commercial markets per region is €17, in Crete it is €26 per person, in Athens it is €15, in the Aegean and Corfu it is €13. Daily spending in commercial markets by nationality: Americans leave €21 per day, French leave €18 per day, Germans leave €17 per day, Italians leave €16 per day, and English leave €20 per day. This is our heavy industry. In 5 days, an Englishman will leave €700-€800 in Greece. The rest of the airline hotel is going out, they don't leave that money here though, because everything the tourists eat here is imported. So it's not heavy industry. We want to link tourism with the production of wealth and with farmers. Androulakis stole this idea from us, as they steal every proposal we make. But whoever steals proposals and ideas does not mean that they can be implemented. We are talking about applied policy. That is the difference between us and the other parties. What we say, we can implement.
