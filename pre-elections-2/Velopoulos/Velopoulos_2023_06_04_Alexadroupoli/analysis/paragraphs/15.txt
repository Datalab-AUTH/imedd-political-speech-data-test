And the worst thing, friends, is to end here. This is what I read. This research was conducted by a global institute. Greece has the highest rate of depression in the world. We are in first place with 6.52%. How proud can a prime minister feel to lead the country with the highest depression rate in the world? Let's not praise the prime minister and New Democracy, let's not vote for them again for the imprisonment of compulsory abolition of rights, impoverishment, unstoppable terror, and marginalization of Greeks. Let's not applaud them voters and if they want to vote for them again, let's not let them.
