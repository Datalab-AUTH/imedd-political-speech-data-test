Friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the very warm welcome here in the birthplace of our founder Andreas Papandreou, on the democratic island of Chios. I would like to individually thank each and every one of you for the wonderful struggle that you, our parliamentary candidates, the members of PASOK, our friends, have made for the great victory here on Chios. Chios has sent a clear message of the reversal of the current correlations that are pinning the country in a toxic dichotomy. And I am sure that on June 25th, the message from Chios will be a message from all corners of the country. Our parliamentary group has grown and been renewed. We are more united than ever, with many young people well-established in their local communities. I am very happy because there was a strong female presence, which shows that our movement wants women, pioneering mothers who keep the Greek family standing, who unfortunately do not have the opportunities they have in other European countries. This parliamentary group symbolizes the rebirth of the democratic party. However, let us be honest. Nothing has been won yet because victories are won and not given away. We must continue the same struggle in the coming weeks, village by village, town by town, for the rebirth, the great victory, the overthrow of the current correlations. May 21st was the first step. On June 25th, we have a duty to take the next big step because the democratic party has a duty to embrace the anxieties of the Greek people.

The new generation. Hundreds of thousands of Greek children from all over Greece have left abroad in the last 10-12 years. These children need to see that the country is changing, reforming. That we are a normal state, meritocracy, transparency, with good jobs, so that they can return and those who are here can have a perspective. It is the conviction of the Democratic Party that only if the young generation stands on its feet will our country stand on its own feet, so our priority is to provide many opportunities for young people, with strong public education, with skills and, above all, with a mature labor market, where they will have many opportunities to start a family and create wealth. That is growth for the many. That is the just growth of our party.

And it's not Mitsotakis' development, it's the development of the Greek economy, for the few and the powerful. This growth must be inclusive, as it is leading the country into new fiscal adventures.

You know very well that in recent weeks we have been subjected to a merciless war. But we have passed through the complementarities of polarization, toxicity, and misinformation. We have emerged victorious in spite of our opponents and the powerful economic interests that support them, who are making themselves comfortable. When you have a toxic opposition, what good is it for a government steeped in corruption to be no match for a credible solution such as the democratic party? Mr Mitsotakis is being helped by Syriza. But now PASOK is here, united, strong. The real alternative force against the Right, as we were, and I call on every democrat, every progressive to lean on this historic movement so that New Democracy has a real opponent and not its golden sponsor. Where are the pollsters today that Mr Tsipras denounced? He himself, Mr Polakis, the Syriza executives were saying that the polls were unfair to them. It was not 28-29 that they were showing but 31-32 and it turned out to be 20% and it turned out that they supported them for the benefit of New Democracy in order to scare the centrists. Do you know? Just as lies have short legs, so these cheap games have short legs, because the end of this story is the will of the Greek people, it is the strength of all of you, it is the strength of the democratic party. We have supported this new beginning for the people, not for the few and the powerful who are served by the New Democracy system. Do you know? The polls scandalously favored the so-called anti-systemic gentlemen of Syriza. It was convenient to oppose the no alternative. But now here they have programmatic opposition, the opposition of this one, but before I go into that, I want to say something to the Syriza gentlemen. It is the fault of the communist party, he says, it is the fault of PASOK because the map is blue. It is also the fault of the simple proportional representation that they brought in. I want to remind Mr Tsipras that the map was blue in 2019 as well. Not only in the national elections but also in the regional elections. And if Stavros Arnaoutakis had not been in Crete, New Democracy would have had 13 regions, Mr Tsipras, so that you do not sell seaweed for silk ribbons. You made the map blue with your division and populism over the last 5 years and we are here to make it green and democratic for a better perspective, for a real hope for all Greeks. But, friends, in recent hours we have been under an asymmetrical attack from New Democracy and the powerful interests of the economic elite that support it. You know, the dilemma of the elections is not what they want to pass. They were saying in the last election, who are you going to go with? And I would answer them, we have a program and we are waiting for the popular verdict because governments are not made in the spotlight, but as in all of Europe with programmatic convergences after the popular verdict in the spotlight. In the end, it turned out that all this talk and all the false blackmail to the Greek people produced results for Mr Mitsotakis.

40% is not an offer to the people. The Patsis are not an offer. The interceptions are not an offer. The inequalities are not an offer. The collapse of the National Health System is not an offer. The decline of public education is not an offer. Our country is not an offer to be targeted by the European institutions on issues of democracy and respect for human rights.

The only reason why Mr Mitsotakis has risen instead of falling is that his golden sponsor failed to have a real programmatic government proposal for the country. Now, of course, they see that PASOK is coming back to the forefront of history steadily, with a perspective, with a credible, progressive speech, with a new political ethos, without internet gangs that poison our children, but with a foresighted, daily struggle, with the citizen by their side. The strange attacks begin. What are they?

Today he says that they have discovered that PASOK's program is a tax storm against the Greek people. What is this tax storm? So I want to present the facts. In 2022, when milk and bread prices were decreasing, 150 listed companies tripled their profits, to the detriment of the Greek people and to the benefit of the powerful, not for social or economic justice. And what did you do about it? Nothing. Two-thirds of the state's revenues come from indirect taxes. Who is affected by indirect taxes? The middle class and the weakest.

And of course, the injustices continue. Mr. Mitsotakis has put 50 billion more debt on the backs of the Greek people. The Greeks are third from the bottom of the European Union in terms of purchasing power. And of course, the country's trade deficit is the largest since 2010. I did not hear journalists constantly asking the New Democracy party executives where Mr. Mitsotakis is leading our country. Is he the new Karamanlis? Are they once again leading us into adventures with fiscal populism? What are they doing today? They are giving a little to the many and a lot to the few. Didn't Mr. Karamanlis do the same thing and tell us in 2007 that they had a shielded economy? What happened after 2 years? Memoranda, oppression, injustice.

We have a duty on June 25th to stop the unjust and dangerous policies of the New Democracy system of power. So why are they attacking PASOK's tax program? Let us address their criticisms one by one. They claim that we want to tax the most powerful. Is that unfair? In which European country do the strongest not pay more than the weakest? Therefore, I want us to address their criticisms specifically. We are being criticized for reducing the tax-free parental allowance from 4.8 million euros to 400,000 euros per parent, or 800,000 euros per couple. Can you tell me, is there a middle-class or weak Greek parent who can give their children 4.8 million euros worth of tax-free property, Mr. Mitsotakis? Who does this injustice affect, the people or your oligarch friends?

Secondly, let's talk about dividends. Mr. Skertos claims that PASOK's tax policy on dividends is unfair and is hurting the middle class, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Greek economy. On the other hand, New Democracy has implemented a 5% flat tax rate on all dividends, regardless of whether they are worth 10,000 or 2 million.

So I'm going for the middle price of 70,000. To help you understand the populism and how the media is supporting Mr. Mitsotakis with their attack on us today, we propose the following difference: from 5% to 10% is from 3,500 to 4,500.

For a start, Mr. Skerchos, will the Greek economy be deflated due to the billions of red loans that you sold to the funds and the crows that are blackmailing the Greek people, small and medium-sized enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives? This is the danger of the deflation of the Greek economy, and not fair social democratic taxation. So, that's it. That's the end of the class-based tax policy, where the few gain a lot at the expense of the middle class.

Yes to a strong welfare state. Yes to a fair tax policy in order to achieve social justice and national dignity. This is PASOK's compass. This is the compass of the Democratic Party. And what will we do with the revenues? What will we do with the revenues of the rich? The facts are inexorable, dear friends. There is no greater national issue than demographics. Greece is aging, our villages have no population, there are no workers, young children are leaving the country, what will we do? Portugal has a 10-point tax rate difference between a family with no children and a family with 2 children. Ireland has a 15-point difference. The Czech Republic has a 14-point difference. Greece has a 3-point difference. Which one? Greece, which is at risk of having a population of only eight and a half million in the next 20 years, does not provide tax incentives for young couples, but has the luxury of providing tax incentives for oligarchs. It's either that or fraud against our country, Mr. Mitsotakis.

What else are we going to do to support the family and workers, and reduce the black economy? We will reduce tax rates and contributions on wage labor. This will increase revenue, reduce black market activity, and provide decent wages for our children to stay here. These are not policies that the new generation of PASOK has forgotten. These are policies that have created societies of dignity and perspective throughout the European Union, not societies of division that lack the strength to stand on their own two feet. Therefore, we are serving the European social model: fair taxation and a strong welfare state.

What welfare state? The welfare state that has health and public health at its heart. This party created the National Health System with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos. This party has a duty to revive the National Health System to stop the Greek people from being third in private spending across Europe. We are surpassed only by Bulgaria and Lithuania. You are well aware of the problems here in Chios too in health issues. I was informed earlier, but I want to tell you that it is the same everywhere. What are we doing? Because of the pandemic, Europe has set up the Recovery Fund. 32 billion was given, 20 of them subsidies. But when a pandemic fund is set up, isn't health a priority? Greece gave 2% of the fund for health. 11% for Italy, 9% for Portugal. We are committed to 8% for a strong National Health System and we are not handing over public health, with its shameful surgeries, its shameful lists, to the private sector for the profit of those who serve the system of power of the New Democracy.

Friends, what about public education? We hear divisive dilemmas about the base 10 and problems in universities. What are we going to do? We have a clear proposal that starts at the bottom of our education system. A national baccalaureate is the only solution to stop public schools from being stalls with the only priority being tutorials. It will not be one-week or one-month exams where students and their families experience a huge amount of anxiety about passing, but 2-year exams so that a national baccalaureate can gracefully guide children to their choices. And of course, with strong remedial teaching for children who can't afford it, and with the strengthening of special structures. We have a duty to build an inclusive school and not have tens of thousands of parents whose children have learning disabilities or others on the autism spectrum in a dire situation because they cannot financially support their families. These special education structures are a priority in all modern European states. We owe it to them to be a priority in Greece too, in the normal Greece that the Greek people really deserve.

Friends and comrades. The Greek mother. I declare here, from Chios, in the North-Eastern Aegean, that it is our duty to inform every mother in advance that no Greek child will be left out of a nursery or a creative employment center. That there will be an increase in the maternity allowance for freelance women. An amendment that we submitted to Parliament a few months ago, but which the current government did not vote for.

Friends and acquaintances. There is a crisis of trust between the public and politicians. The public does not believe them. There is too much talk, too much populism, and too little action. Politicians say one thing before elections and do another thing after elections. Unworthiness, corruption, clientelism, and opacity are the main reasons why younger generations are not interested in political parties.

From the very beginning, my goal was to make the younger generation love PASOK again. I am proud to say that this was proven at the ballot box, where we saw a similar expression for the first time in generations. My aspiration is to make the younger generation's faith in the democratic party even more dynamic on June 25th. That is why I am committed to a decent party that tells the truth, no matter the cost.

What did Mr Mitsotakis do? Did he bring meritocracy? Hundreds of audits of New Democracy show the tragedy of Tempe. They are protagonists in hospitals and organizations, but there is no meritocracy. Excellent company and all the other tools of the company are used in public organizations to do the buffet of Maximou. This was the so-called new era of Mr Mitsotakis which, either because of the interceptions or because of the inefficiency or because of the difference, reminds us of 90-93, when his father was the protagonist. We have a duty to remember our history and the suffering that these political choices have brought to our country.

So what do we say? Transparency everywhere. No more billions of direct awards. The New Republic has given 10 billion direct commissions. Dignity everywhere. What does this mean? After the elections, in 2 months, there will be an open international competition for the administrations of all hospitals and organizations. There will be a strong financial incentive to bring the best Greeks with competence and strong resumes to serve the public interest. They will not be the state tool of each power for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the citizens. People who know the subjects, who know health, who know education, who know the infrastructure, so that they can make good use of European resources and not have the state be the prey of the power that is in power. Transparency everywhere. All decisions, all tenders, the era of open data is an era that we must exploit in order to ensure transparency in Greek society, so that every citizen knows where every last euro of taxes paid to the state goes. Strengthening independent authorities. We created these independent authorities, PASOK. And what has happened? There have been 15-19 continuous attacks on the independent authorities, the burnt-out Tsipras system. Mitsotakis used to say, "I will come to bring institutional normality." There are interceptions, attacks on the independent authorities by Mr Georgiades and Mr Voridis. The only party that is faithful to the values of democracy, the separation of powers, respect and human rights is this party. That is why it is the democratic party. We have no titles. We do not have titles of ownership, but we have values that we honour and we fly the flag of dignity, the flag of hope, the flag of justice, the flag of perspective. This is our party and this party is being reborn here today from the democratic island of Chios, the birthplace of Andreas Papandreou.

Friends, our pensioners are a huge issue. We don't talk about it much. They ask us, "Have you costed your program?" Yes, we have costed it. Have they costed their program? So I suggest something simple. Because programs are relative in cost, especially when you cut tax rates and raise others, and it's clearly about how the economy is going to go, each political leader should say what the cost of purely public spending is. For example, pensions. You're going to give a billion on pensions. Our program says 130 million a year for 4 years, which is a new CSF for 350,000 low pensioners. That is what Mr. Tsipras cut when he said he would tear up the memoranda. Abolition of the personal differential is a huge issue for both NAT pensioners and other pensioners. And of course, redressing the injustices for widowhood and disability pensions, which is a big social issue, and we need to support all these people. These have a certain size and cost that the Greek economy can bear.

Friends, private debt is a huge issue after the cost of living. What about private debt? We cannot let the funds blackmail the borrowers. We have a duty to pass a law that puts a framework in the negotiations so that the priority is regulation, not the elimination of the borrower. The vultures of the funds want to take bits of Greek land rather than Greek bonds so that they can go on to destroy other societies in the future. This patriotic movement will not allow the Greek economy to deflate. That is why I call on all parties to vote together for a negotiation rule between the borrower and the funds.

Second issue: Agricultural land. Total protection of rural land to give it a second chance at dignity.

Swiss franc: 80,000 families are trapped in Swiss franc loans. Our proposal is clear: 1/3 of the interest rate increase due to the exchange rate change will be on the borrower and 2/3 on the banking institution. And finally, the 120 installments.

Mr Mitsotakis said during the election that he introduced 120 installments. The Youth Pass was the biggest election mockery. Does Mr Mitsotakis believe that the youth of Greece are unworthy and will accept the Youth Pass? The younger generation has dignity and desires employment, social housing, and public education, not Mr Mitsotakis' undignified Youth Passes.

We are proposing 120 installments for everyone to be able to participate in the scheme, including the tax office and EFKA, in order to increase liquidity in the market and support small and medium-sized enterprises in our country. The Recovery Fund loans were not intended for the benefit of the powerful at a lower interest rate, as they will be going to the banks regardless. Priority will be given to SMEs with criteria beyond market standards, such as digital, climate, and synergy incentives, as well as the creation of new jobs, to ensure that the Recovery Fund loans are used to support SMEs.

My friends, I cannot fail to mention the issues concerning Turkey from Chios. Turkey has held elections and things have taken a certain turn. Mr Erdogan, in alliance with Mr Bachcheli of the Grey Wolves, is not providing security in the South-Eastern Mediterranean. And because I do not like big words, I believe that the priority is a new Helsinki and not the nonsense about Prespes in the Aegean or the sea having no borders. These ideologies of the Left do not fit into the patriotic movement of PASOK. Enough of this dangerous wit of Mr Tsipras. What is the new Helsinki? There is no European perspective for Turkey. There is an extreme violation of human rights within the country and, of course, aggressive action throughout the region, involving Greece, Cyprus, and other countries outside the European Union.

What do we say? The only incentive is the upgrading of the 1995 Customs Union with Turkey, with the benefit for Greece of an agreement to respect our sovereign rights and the delineation of maritime zones only through respect for international law. And of course, until all these things are done, which I believe will be very difficult to do in the coming period, the European partners must commit themselves, and this is a struggle of all parties, a national struggle, so that no European state sells a single bullet to Turkey. This people cannot pay billions for armaments, with the burden on the welfare state, health and education, where this money could go, and some Germans and Spaniards giving billions for armaments to Turkey. That is not European solidarity. We want a Europe of peoples, of solidarity and of a common foreign policy. In the Europe of the Euroarmy, of European borders. That means a united Europe, not the Europe of markets. The Europe of the directorate, as our founder Andreas Papandreou used to say. And that is what I expect to hear from both Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis. Because people do not need to go to Brussels to make friendly relations with other leaders. They need to go there to demand a better Greece, a strong Greece, but also a better Europe. The experience of Ukraine is a guide. Just as Mr Putin created a huge geopolitical issue in Europe, so another leader in the future may do the same in the neighboring country. We too have a duty, in order to prevent the worst from happening, to be pan-European prepared and we have a duty to play a leading role in these unified policies of the Union and not to pursue policies that are dead-end for the future of Hellenism.

The refugee-migration issue is a significant problem in the Northeastern Aegean. Europe has given billions of euros, but comparatively less has been received by Turkey from Greece, despite the similar populations. It is necessary to investigate how the money was spent and absorbed by Greece. The New Democracy government must answer for this and address the problem in the long term. The solution is an institutional one: reform Dublin. The Socialists propose that anyone who enters Greece should apply for asylum in all countries of the European Union, and that relocation should be based on population, unemployment rates, and economic situation. The New Democracy has neglected solidarity policies for the benefit of conservative Europe. The country needs immigrants to work on Greek land and have a competitive primary sector economy. The government should implement a strategic plan to solve real problems throughout Greece and prevent the loss of human lives in the Aegean.

These are comprehensive solutions to problems. They solve problems normally, with dialogue, consensus, and convergence, not with issues such as the Evros issue. And I want to say this too: what happened on the Evros fence? What was the big issue of the conflict between New Democracy and Syriza? We started the fence. PASOK started it. What was the conflict? Why did Mr Tsipras, if he disagreed, not tear it down? Because quite simply, on this issue, as on the refugee-migration issue, instead of looking for solutions, they are consciously mocking the Greek people. SYRIZA's proposal was simply that the European taxpayer should not pay for the fence. That was SYRIZA's priority, that you, the Greek people, should pay for it, not the Europeans. Structures that should be paid for by the entire European Union, such as Frontex. Only if these defence, security, and border protection policies are a European policy, only then will we have comprehensive solutions for all the problems throughout Greece.

Friends, I know very well that the economy has huge issues now, especially in Mytilene, after 2015. There has to be a special plan for insularity, regional development, and all issues concerning our islands. All our islands, not just the outlying ones, have huge infrastructure issues. So, remember which party was for regional development and self-government? This party will guarantee a fair distribution of European funds, not an Athenian-centric state that is comfortable coddling the oligarchy and the few. Regional development is the only way forward for a strong Greece of the future.

Friends, in closing, I really want to thank you for having a parliamentary presence after years. But I want to ask from the bottom of my heart that you do not give up this effort. I want you to trust me. And I believe that this new era of PASOK, which we have learned from our mistakes and I pledge to you, will not disappoint any Greek man or woman. Our compass is political ethics, our compass is credibility, our compass is respect for people, our compass is respect for the environment, our compass is social justice and national dignity. This was our movement and I ask that in the coming weeks each and every one of you individually take into your hands the struggle for the rebirth of PASOK, for the rebirth of the democratic party. A strong PASOK means a Greece of dignity. A strong PASOK means hope and prospects for all Greeks. Four weeks of struggle and 25 June, you can be sure that together we will once again be at the forefront of great changes. The real opponents of maintenance. The party that Mr Mitsotakis really does not want to face. The party of program, realism, and progress. Fight, a few days and the great victory is near. I also pledge here from Chios that I will do everything in my power on 25 June to ensure that PASOK and every progressive democrat return home so that together we can make a brave new start, for the brave, new change that our country and the Greek people need. Be well. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and rest assured that on 25 June the wind of change will blow from Crete, Macedonia, Chios to Thrace. All Greece united, strong, with PASOK united, strong. PASOK of progress, hope, and perspective. Be well, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Friends, I know very well that we have not held such rallies for years, and because this is the opening rally for the 25th of June, we started here to send a message that PASOK will embrace our whole country and especially our islands, especially our outlying islands. All of Greece as one fist. We want a united people and not a divided people for the benefit of the toxic political situation represented by SYRIZA and New Democracy. Unity among the people is a victory for the country and that is what the democratic party is. Bless you, thank you very much.
