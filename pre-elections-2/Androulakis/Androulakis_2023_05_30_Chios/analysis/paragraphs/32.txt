Friends, I know very well that the economy has huge issues now, especially in Mytilene, after 2015. There has to be a special plan for insularity, regional development, and all issues concerning our islands. All our islands, not just the outlying ones, have huge infrastructure issues. So, remember which party was for regional development and self-government? This party will guarantee a fair distribution of European funds, not an Athenian-centric state that is comfortable coddling the oligarchy and the few. Regional development is the only way forward for a strong Greece of the future.
