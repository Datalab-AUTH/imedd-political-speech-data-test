The refugee-migration issue is a significant problem in the Northeastern Aegean. Europe has given billions of euros, but comparatively less has been received by Turkey from Greece, despite the similar populations. It is necessary to investigate how the money was spent and absorbed by Greece. The New Democracy government must answer for this and address the problem in the long term. The solution is an institutional one: reform Dublin. The Socialists propose that anyone who enters Greece should apply for asylum in all countries of the European Union, and that relocation should be based on population, unemployment rates, and economic situation. The New Democracy has neglected solidarity policies for the benefit of conservative Europe. The country needs immigrants to work on Greek land and have a competitive primary sector economy. The government should implement a strategic plan to solve real problems throughout Greece and prevent the loss of human lives in the Aegean.
