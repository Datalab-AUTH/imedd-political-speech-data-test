Yes to a strong welfare state. Yes to a fair tax policy in order to achieve social justice and national dignity. This is PASOK's compass. This is the compass of the Democratic Party. And what will we do with the revenues? What will we do with the revenues of the rich? The facts are inexorable, dear friends. There is no greater national issue than demographics. Greece is aging, our villages have no population, there are no workers, young children are leaving the country, what will we do? Portugal has a 10-point tax rate difference between a family with no children and a family with 2 children. Ireland has a 15-point difference. The Czech Republic has a 14-point difference. Greece has a 3-point difference. Which one? Greece, which is at risk of having a population of only eight and a half million in the next 20 years, does not provide tax incentives for young couples, but has the luxury of providing tax incentives for oligarchs. It's either that or fraud against our country, Mr. Mitsotakis.
