What else are we going to do to support the family and workers, and reduce the black economy? We will reduce tax rates and contributions on wage labor. This will increase revenue, reduce black market activity, and provide decent wages for our children to stay here. These are not policies that the new generation of PASOK has forgotten. These are policies that have created societies of dignity and perspective throughout the European Union, not societies of division that lack the strength to stand on their own two feet. Therefore, we are serving the European social model: fair taxation and a strong welfare state.
