These are comprehensive solutions to problems. They solve problems normally, with dialogue, consensus, and convergence, not with issues such as the Evros issue. And I want to say this too: what happened on the Evros fence? What was the big issue of the conflict between New Democracy and Syriza? We started the fence. PASOK started it. What was the conflict? Why did Mr Tsipras, if he disagreed, not tear it down? Because quite simply, on this issue, as on the refugee-migration issue, instead of looking for solutions, they are consciously mocking the Greek people. SYRIZA's proposal was simply that the European taxpayer should not pay for the fence. That was SYRIZA's priority, that you, the Greek people, should pay for it, not the Europeans. Structures that should be paid for by the entire European Union, such as Frontex. Only if these defence, security, and border protection policies are a European policy, only then will we have comprehensive solutions for all the problems throughout Greece.
