Mr Mitsotakis said during the election that he introduced 120 installments. The Youth Pass was the biggest election mockery. Does Mr Mitsotakis believe that the youth of Greece are unworthy and will accept the Youth Pass? The younger generation has dignity and desires employment, social housing, and public education, not Mr Mitsotakis' undignified Youth Passes.
