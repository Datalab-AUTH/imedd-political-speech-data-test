My friends, I cannot fail to mention the issues concerning Turkey from Chios. Turkey has held elections and things have taken a certain turn. Mr Erdogan, in alliance with Mr Bachcheli of the Grey Wolves, is not providing security in the South-Eastern Mediterranean. And because I do not like big words, I believe that the priority is a new Helsinki and not the nonsense about Prespes in the Aegean or the sea having no borders. These ideologies of the Left do not fit into the patriotic movement of PASOK. Enough of this dangerous wit of Mr Tsipras. What is the new Helsinki? There is no European perspective for Turkey. There is an extreme violation of human rights within the country and, of course, aggressive action throughout the region, involving Greece, Cyprus, and other countries outside the European Union.
