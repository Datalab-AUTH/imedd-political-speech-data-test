We are proposing 120 installments for everyone to be able to participate in the scheme, including the tax office and EFKA, in order to increase liquidity in the market and support small and medium-sized enterprises in our country. The Recovery Fund loans were not intended for the benefit of the powerful at a lower interest rate, as they will be going to the banks regardless. Priority will be given to SMEs with criteria beyond market standards, such as digital, climate, and synergy incentives, as well as the creation of new jobs, to ensure that the Recovery Fund loans are used to support SMEs.
