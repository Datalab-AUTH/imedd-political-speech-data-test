Friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the very warm welcome here in the birthplace of our founder Andreas Papandreou, on the democratic island of Chios. I would like to individually thank each and every one of you for the wonderful struggle that you, our parliamentary candidates, the members of PASOK, our friends, have made for the great victory here on Chios. Chios has sent a clear message of the reversal of the current correlations that are pinning the country in a toxic dichotomy. And I am sure that on June 25th, the message from Chios will be a message from all corners of the country. Our parliamentary group has grown and been renewed. We are more united than ever, with many young people well-established in their local communities. I am very happy because there was a strong female presence, which shows that our movement wants women, pioneering mothers who keep the Greek family standing, who unfortunately do not have the opportunities they have in other European countries. This parliamentary group symbolizes the rebirth of the democratic party. However, let us be honest. Nothing has been won yet because victories are won and not given away. We must continue the same struggle in the coming weeks, village by village, town by town, for the rebirth, the great victory, the overthrow of the current correlations. May 21st was the first step. On June 25th, we have a duty to take the next big step because the democratic party has a duty to embrace the anxieties of the Greek people.
