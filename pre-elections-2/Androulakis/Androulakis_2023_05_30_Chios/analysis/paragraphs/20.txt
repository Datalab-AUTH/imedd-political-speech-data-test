What did Mr Mitsotakis do? Did he bring meritocracy? Hundreds of audits of New Democracy show the tragedy of Tempe. They are protagonists in hospitals and organizations, but there is no meritocracy. Excellent company and all the other tools of the company are used in public organizations to do the buffet of Maximou. This was the so-called new era of Mr Mitsotakis which, either because of the interceptions or because of the inefficiency or because of the difference, reminds us of 90-93, when his father was the protagonist. We have a duty to remember our history and the suffering that these political choices have brought to our country.
