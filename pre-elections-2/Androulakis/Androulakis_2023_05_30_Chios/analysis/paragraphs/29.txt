What do we say? The only incentive is the upgrading of the 1995 Customs Union with Turkey, with the benefit for Greece of an agreement to respect our sovereign rights and the delineation of maritime zones only through respect for international law. And of course, until all these things are done, which I believe will be very difficult to do in the coming period, the European partners must commit themselves, and this is a struggle of all parties, a national struggle, so that no European state sells a single bullet to Turkey. This people cannot pay billions for armaments, with the burden on the welfare state, health and education, where this money could go, and some Germans and Spaniards giving billions for armaments to Turkey. That is not European solidarity. We want a Europe of peoples, of solidarity and of a common foreign policy. In the Europe of the Euroarmy, of European borders. That means a united Europe, not the Europe of markets. The Europe of the directorate, as our founder Andreas Papandreou used to say. And that is what I expect to hear from both Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis. Because people do not need to go to Brussels to make friendly relations with other leaders. They need to go there to demand a better Greece, a strong Greece, but also a better Europe. The experience of Ukraine is a guide. Just as Mr Putin created a huge geopolitical issue in Europe, so another leader in the future may do the same in the neighboring country. We too have a duty, in order to prevent the worst from happening, to be pan-European prepared and we have a duty to play a leading role in these unified policies of the Union and not to pursue policies that are dead-end for the future of Hellenism.
