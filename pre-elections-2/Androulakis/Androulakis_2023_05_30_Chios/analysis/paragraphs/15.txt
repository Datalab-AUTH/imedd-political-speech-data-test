What welfare state? The welfare state that has health and public health at its heart. This party created the National Health System with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos. This party has a duty to revive the National Health System to stop the Greek people from being third in private spending across Europe. We are surpassed only by Bulgaria and Lithuania. You are well aware of the problems here in Chios too in health issues. I was informed earlier, but I want to tell you that it is the same everywhere. What are we doing? Because of the pandemic, Europe has set up the Recovery Fund. 32 billion was given, 20 of them subsidies. But when a pandemic fund is set up, isn't health a priority? Greece gave 2% of the fund for health. 11% for Italy, 9% for Portugal. We are committed to 8% for a strong National Health System and we are not handing over public health, with its shameful surgeries, its shameful lists, to the private sector for the profit of those who serve the system of power of the New Democracy.
