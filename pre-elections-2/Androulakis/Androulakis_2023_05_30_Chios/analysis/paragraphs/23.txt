Friends, private debt is a huge issue after the cost of living. What about private debt? We cannot let the funds blackmail the borrowers. We have a duty to pass a law that puts a framework in the negotiations so that the priority is regulation, not the elimination of the borrower. The vultures of the funds want to take bits of Greek land rather than Greek bonds so that they can go on to destroy other societies in the future. This patriotic movement will not allow the Greek economy to deflate. That is why I call on all parties to vote together for a negotiation rule between the borrower and the funds.
