The new generation. Hundreds of thousands of Greek children from all over Greece have left abroad in the last 10-12 years. These children need to see that the country is changing, reforming. That we are a normal state, meritocracy, transparency, with good jobs, so that they can return and those who are here can have a perspective. It is the conviction of the Democratic Party that only if the young generation stands on its feet will our country stand on its own feet, so our priority is to provide many opportunities for young people, with strong public education, with skills and, above all, with a mature labor market, where they will have many opportunities to start a family and create wealth. That is growth for the many. That is the just growth of our party.
