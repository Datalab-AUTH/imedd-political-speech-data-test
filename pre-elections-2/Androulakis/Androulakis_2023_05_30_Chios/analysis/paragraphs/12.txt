For a start, Mr. Skerchos, will the Greek economy be deflated due to the billions of red loans that you sold to the funds and the crows that are blackmailing the Greek people, small and medium-sized enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives? This is the danger of the deflation of the Greek economy, and not fair social democratic taxation. So, that's it. That's the end of the class-based tax policy, where the few gain a lot at the expense of the middle class.
