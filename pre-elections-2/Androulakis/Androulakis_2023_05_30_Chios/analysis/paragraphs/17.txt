Friends and comrades. The Greek mother. I declare here, from Chios, in the North-Eastern Aegean, that it is our duty to inform every mother in advance that no Greek child will be left out of a nursery or a creative employment center. That there will be an increase in the maternity allowance for freelance women. An amendment that we submitted to Parliament a few months ago, but which the current government did not vote for.
