40% is not an offer to the people. The Patsis are not an offer. The interceptions are not an offer. The inequalities are not an offer. The collapse of the National Health System is not an offer. The decline of public education is not an offer. Our country is not an offer to be targeted by the European institutions on issues of democracy and respect for human rights.
