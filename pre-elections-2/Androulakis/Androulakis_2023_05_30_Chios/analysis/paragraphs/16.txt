Friends, what about public education? We hear divisive dilemmas about the base 10 and problems in universities. What are we going to do? We have a clear proposal that starts at the bottom of our education system. A national baccalaureate is the only solution to stop public schools from being stalls with the only priority being tutorials. It will not be one-week or one-month exams where students and their families experience a huge amount of anxiety about passing, but 2-year exams so that a national baccalaureate can gracefully guide children to their choices. And of course, with strong remedial teaching for children who can't afford it, and with the strengthening of special structures. We have a duty to build an inclusive school and not have tens of thousands of parents whose children have learning disabilities or others on the autism spectrum in a dire situation because they cannot financially support their families. These special education structures are a priority in all modern European states. We owe it to them to be a priority in Greece too, in the normal Greece that the Greek people really deserve.
