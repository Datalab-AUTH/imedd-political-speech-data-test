We have a duty on June 25th to stop the unjust and dangerous policies of the New Democracy system of power. So why are they attacking PASOK's tax program? Let us address their criticisms one by one. They claim that we want to tax the most powerful. Is that unfair? In which European country do the strongest not pay more than the weakest? Therefore, I want us to address their criticisms specifically. We are being criticized for reducing the tax-free parental allowance from 4.8 million euros to 400,000 euros per parent, or 800,000 euros per couple. Can you tell me, is there a middle-class or weak Greek parent who can give their children 4.8 million euros worth of tax-free property, Mr. Mitsotakis? Who does this injustice affect, the people or your oligarch friends?
