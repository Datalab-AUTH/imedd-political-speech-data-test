Friends and acquaintances. There is a crisis of trust between the public and politicians. The public does not believe them. There is too much talk, too much populism, and too little action. Politicians say one thing before elections and do another thing after elections. Unworthiness, corruption, clientelism, and opacity are the main reasons why younger generations are not interested in political parties.
