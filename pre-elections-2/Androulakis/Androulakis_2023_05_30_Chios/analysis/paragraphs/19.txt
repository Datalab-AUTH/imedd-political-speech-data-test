From the very beginning, my goal was to make the younger generation love PASOK again. I am proud to say that this was proven at the ballot box, where we saw a similar expression for the first time in generations. My aspiration is to make the younger generation's faith in the democratic party even more dynamic on June 25th. That is why I am committed to a decent party that tells the truth, no matter the cost.
