Friends, our pensioners are a huge issue. We don't talk about it much. They ask us, "Have you costed your program?" Yes, we have costed it. Have they costed their program? So I suggest something simple. Because programs are relative in cost, especially when you cut tax rates and raise others, and it's clearly about how the economy is going to go, each political leader should say what the cost of purely public spending is. For example, pensions. You're going to give a billion on pensions. Our program says 130 million a year for 4 years, which is a new CSF for 350,000 low pensioners. That is what Mr. Tsipras cut when he said he would tear up the memoranda. Abolition of the personal differential is a huge issue for both NAT pensioners and other pensioners. And of course, redressing the injustices for widowhood and disability pensions, which is a big social issue, and we need to support all these people. These have a certain size and cost that the Greek economy can bear.
