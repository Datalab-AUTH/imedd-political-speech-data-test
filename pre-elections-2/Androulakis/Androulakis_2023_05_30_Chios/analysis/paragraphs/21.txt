So what do we say? Transparency everywhere. No more billions of direct awards. The New Republic has given 10 billion direct commissions. Dignity everywhere. What does this mean? After the elections, in 2 months, there will be an open international competition for the administrations of all hospitals and organizations. There will be a strong financial incentive to bring the best Greeks with competence and strong resumes to serve the public interest. They will not be the state tool of each power for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the citizens. People who know the subjects, who know health, who know education, who know the infrastructure, so that they can make good use of European resources and not have the state be the prey of the power that is in power. Transparency everywhere. All decisions, all tenders, the era of open data is an era that we must exploit in order to ensure transparency in Greek society, so that every citizen knows where every last euro of taxes paid to the state goes. Strengthening independent authorities. We created these independent authorities, PASOK. And what has happened? There have been 15-19 continuous attacks on the independent authorities, the burnt-out Tsipras system. Mitsotakis used to say, "I will come to bring institutional normality." There are interceptions, attacks on the independent authorities by Mr Georgiades and Mr Voridis. The only party that is faithful to the values of democracy, the separation of powers, respect and human rights is this party. That is why it is the democratic party. We have no titles. We do not have titles of ownership, but we have values that we honour and we fly the flag of dignity, the flag of hope, the flag of justice, the flag of perspective. This is our party and this party is being reborn here today from the democratic island of Chios, the birthplace of Andreas Papandreou.
