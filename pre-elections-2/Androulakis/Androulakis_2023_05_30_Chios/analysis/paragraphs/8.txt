And of course, the injustices continue. Mr. Mitsotakis has put 50 billion more debt on the backs of the Greek people. The Greeks are third from the bottom of the European Union in terms of purchasing power. And of course, the country's trade deficit is the largest since 2010. I did not hear journalists constantly asking the New Democracy party executives where Mr. Mitsotakis is leading our country. Is he the new Karamanlis? Are they once again leading us into adventures with fiscal populism? What are they doing today? They are giving a little to the many and a lot to the few. Didn't Mr. Karamanlis do the same thing and tell us in 2007 that they had a shielded economy? What happened after 2 years? Memoranda, oppression, injustice.
