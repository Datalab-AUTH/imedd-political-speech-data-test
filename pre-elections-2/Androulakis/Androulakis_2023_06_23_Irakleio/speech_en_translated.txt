People of Heraklion, people of Crete, I am deeply touched by your warm welcome here in my homeland, which has been identified with democratic struggles since the time of Eleftherios Venizelos. Here, from the great castle of the Democratic Party, memory meets hope today. Friends, in this very square a few weeks ago, I pledged to you that on May 21st, we would be victorious. Today, I pledge to you that on Sunday evening, June 25th, we will pick up the thread of history again. So, here's why. For this, then. Here, from Democratic Heraklion, I call on every patriot, every progressive, every Democrat, whatever party they voted for on May 21st, to trust our movement, to trust us on this new path, on renewal, on hope, on dignity, on perspective. PASOK is here, united and strong, with the new generation in the lead, with the Greek people in the lead. We are turning the page as if we were becoming the protagonists.

So, I pledge here at Democratic Heraklion that we will stand by the citizens every day, embracing their aspirations for better days, dignity, perspective, and justice. Friends, today is a day of remembrance because 25 years have passed since the death of our great founder, Andreas Papandreou. Andreas, whom the Greek people loved like no other, was the politician who sealed the modern history of our country. He fought for social justice and national dignity, guaranteed the prosperity of all Greeks, fought for a Europe of solidarity between peoples, and is the best-known politician since the Second World War, a Greek beyond the borders of Europe.

Friends, today we are concluding a long campaign here in Democratic Heraklion, during which I met thousands of people in every part of the country. These people expect a lot from us and we have a duty to offer them strong hope. We have a duty to serve the people and the country, to serve the needs of the Greek people for meritocracy, transparency, strong public education, and strong public health. Our young people need skills for the future, and this party will faithfully serve the younger generations. We have a duty to address the high cost of living. For a new Greece, we will fight every day for progress, for creation, for a strong Greece in Europe, for leadership. Friends, we have a duty to face the high cost of living that burdens the Greek family, to support young people, and give prospects for good jobs. For all this, I ask you to fight. For all this, I ask you to succeed on Sunday and to be stronger than ever before.

Friends, Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy aim to identify with stability and responsibility. However, is it stability or a cheap passport policy? It is stability and responsibility to provide 10 billion direct assignments and thousands of post-employment champions, outperforming even SYRIZA. Is it responsible to serve the big and powerful interests of energy producers and suppliers, giving billions of subsidies on the terms of the Greek people? Or is it responsible for the banks to speculate? At a time when our country's purchasing power is third from the bottom in all of Europe? Or is it responsible for the national health care system to be full of lists of shame surgeries? Of course, it is not responsible for the blue guys to take over the state, as we saw in the tragedy of the Tempi River, which overwhelmed the OSE and ERGOSE, and with their omissions in not implementing telecommuting, as the experts' conclusion recently says, to reach a point where 57 lives of our fellow human beings are lost unjustly. Or is it responsible to play with the institutions, with democracy and the rule of law, to set up a surveillance agency, a parastatal mechanism? These are things of the past, and we will consign them to the past. We have a duty to the Greek people to close the books, to settle accounts with maintenance and with the forces that despise your interests, that despise your hopes.

But friends, it is deeply unreliable. New Democracy promises increases in private sector wages up to 25%, but in Brussels a few days ago, where Mr Mitsotakis' tricks don't work, he spoke of only 13%. As Mr Skylakakis revealed, there is no Messiah. In Patras, they were waiting in vain for Mr Mitsotakis. He cannot work miracles. The only miracle is to deceive the Greek people once again. That is why I say you deserve more.

My friends, on May 21, the citizens disapproved of SYRIZA because it proved to be an ineffective government that betrayed the expectations of the Greek people. It said many things that it knew could not be done just for the sake of chairs and power. It spoke of seismic change and turned billions of red loans of borrowers into unconditional and unconditional surrender to the funds that are currently blackmailing the Greek people. They played with the institutions, they attacked the independent authorities, but the citizens... Crete will once again become the castle of the Democratic Party. We have a duty to give it a political color that matches the green of hope, the green of PASOK. However, the citizens disapproved of Mr. Tsipras because he was also an ineffective opposition, because he left Mr. Mitsotakis free to implement his policies. Because he only knew how to engage in toxic confrontation without political substance. He did not hesitate to cancel the values of the left, and I emphasize this, the values of the left that we have historically honored because we are the party of the center-left, the modern center-left. He did not hesitate to disdain the struggles of many years of the Left when, out of desperation, just before the last national elections, he called on the allegedly misguided Chrysaygians to vote for Syriza. It will follow him forever. Thus, he bluntly revealed why he did not vote for the amendment that prevented the killers of Pavlos Fyssas from participating in our democratic constitution that we voted for because democracy is above all, not votes. But it also has a slogan and says justice everywhere. What does it mean by justice everywhere, while for the people, the ordinary citizen? Because if Mr. Pappas, who was convicted 13-0 by the Special Court, believed that, it would not be heads on his head, but it would be in his house. This is not justice; this is mockery. Mr. Tsipras, here from Democratic Heraklion, I have only one thing to say to you: you have managed to make New Democracy powerful for no reason at all. And this will not be forgiven by the progressive democratic people of the country. Because you proved to be Mitsotakis' golden sponsor. So this is why it is a daily struggle for New Democracy to find its real opponent. PASOK, our movement, the power against maintenance and anarchocracy.

Friends, PASOK is here in Syntagma Square, in the Square of Change, and on Sunday night we will be looking at all of you with a weak message of victory from all corners of the country, with each and every one of you as the protagonist. Friends, on Sunday night we have before us the opportunity for change, which will come through daily struggle alongside citizens, the people, women, workers, and the new generation. We embrace the aspirations of our people for better days and serve them faithfully, clashing with interests and everything that prevents Greece from becoming a normal European country. So on June 25th, we have a decisive battle ahead of us. PASOK has a duty to grow stronger to support New Democracy in the next elections in opposition. Step by step, we will become the majority progressive movement of Greece again. This, Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis, is the sole objective of the struggle we are waging every day in every village, town, and neighborhood, so that PASOK can become its genuine, historical, social opponent. We therefore have a duty to overturn the divisions and disappointments that have affected the Greeks, and to break the mechanism of fear. Because the result of New Democracy is not the result of its contribution to the people, but the mechanism of fear of the worst. We give hope for the best, quickly and dynamically. The sooner PASOK becomes stronger, the sooner it will become a side-show of maintenance.

Friends, for this Sunday let's not have 4 more wasted years of an ineffective opposition and a government whose weaknesses and arrogance will increase day by day. We wish we could sanctify. Mr. Mitsotakis should not let us forget the wiretapping and cover-up, which reminded us of the worst of Sakkos and New Democracy. It is rather their family tradition to violate human rights and the separation of powers.

Friends, PASOK's battle is to have a strong and credible opposition, one that will call a spade a spade without weighing the political cost. So let us see what the vision of this party is. The New Democracy government presents an idyllic situation for the economy, but the public debt has increased by some 50 billion. The current account deficit is the largest since 2010, at 12% last year and an estimated 9% this year. And we are told that this is happening all over Europe because of the pandemic energy crisis? No, they are lying. Portugal, with similar economic problems and sizes, had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year. This is the fiscal populism of Mr. Mitsotakis, who is leading the country into new adventures, in perfect imitation of Mr. Karamanlis.

The Recovery Fund was given so that we can make good use of its valuable resources. However, too much goes to the few and powerful, too little to cooperatives, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, and stockbreeders, and too little to productive Greece. Therefore, we propose another model of development that prioritizes sustainable growth, the extroversion of the economy, and good jobs for our children so that they can stay here, create, and grow. We propose a competitive growth model, made in Greece, that redirects the resources of the Recovery Fund based on a national development plan. This plan promotes production that supports innovative value-added investments and links tourism with agri-food and manufacturing. We will not celebrate how many millions came to Greece, but we will celebrate the exports that helped make those millions, featuring Greek domestic products instead of foreign ones. This is the future of productive Greece, where tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing build a strong and resilient Greece that can withstand global turbulence.

And of course, regional development. We are the party of regional development, and you know it, you local government officials who gave a boost to local government and regional development. Our party, and I say this because blood is not water, has the duty to serve another development plan, not the Athenian-centric model. The model of equitable and sustainable regional development.

Friends, or rather, fellow citizens. New Democracy allows for the creation of inflation, obscenity, and speculation. It pretends to deal accurately with all kinds of temporary passes. However, real wages have fallen by 7.4%, not according to Mr. Skertzos, New Democracy MPs, or some morning news, but according to official figures from the OECD and the European Commission, which we trust. They continue to overtax the people, claiming to have reduced direct taxes while increasing indirect taxes. They have reduced taxes less for the vulnerable and middle classes, and more for the powerful. They take many times more from the pockets of the middle and lower classes through indirect taxes, such as VAT and excise duty. In just two years, these taxes have taken in excess of five billion more than the budgeted revenue, making two-thirds of the state's revenue from indirect taxes that hit the weak and increase inequalities. Therefore, we are pushing for substantial measures that protect households, such as reducing taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, with substantial controls on the market, and reducing production costs for farmers. These are permanent measures that protect dignity, not the mocking temporary passes of New Democracy.

Friends and acquaintances throughout the country say one word to me: Dignity. The younger generation is hungry for meritocracy, both those who have stayed here and those who have left. They want a Greece of transparency and meritocracy, and we have a duty to fight for this Greece. Mr. Mitsotakis came as the new thing, as a European liberal. Did he bring meritocracy? Or did he, like his predecessors, make the state the prey of Maximos in order to appoint his own political allies?

We propose that all positions in hospitals, organizations, and everywhere else be selected through an open international competition within two months of the next government being sworn in. All Greeks who are worthy of serving the public interest will submit their CVs, and an independent authority will choose who will serve the people. Even when the Pappas and Demetriades of the day pick up the phone, they will be told "we don't serve Tsipras and Mitsotakis" and hang up on them. This is my goal for a normal European country where the tenant of Maximos has limits to their power and is not uncontrollable.

Friends, in the face of the employer's impunity, which is reinforced by the policies of New Democracy, we promote the new regulation of labor relations through social dialogue. We aim for work with rules and security, decent wages determined through free collective bargaining, and strong control mechanisms that protect the rights of workers.

In health, the man who passed away 27 years ago today is the man who, together with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos, gave birth to the National Health System, which served ordinary Greek citizens for decades. This child of PASOK today is in dire straits because some people do not want to support it. And there is no longer any argument that the state has no money, because it has the Recovery Fund. Why was there a Recovery Fund? It was for the pandemic. Instead of giving 8-10% of the Recovery Fund, as Portugal and Italy did, they gave 2-4%. As a result, we are experiencing tragic events in the ambulance service because 700 rescuers are missing to cover the shifts. But also, the embarrassing waiting lists for an operation. It is outrageous what I was told at the Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki: 3,500 of our fellow citizens are waiting to be operated on because there are only 7 anaesthetists instead of the 28 that are provided. We have a duty to create a strong network of primary health care throughout Greece, on the islands, on the mainland, in the big cities. We owe it to our doctors to get better salaries. Not to study here and go abroad. And of course, we owe it to all health workers to join the heavy and unhealthy, not the mockery of the pandemic that was rewarded with clapping and not a policy they deserve.

Friends, education, and public education are important to us as socialists. We believe that public education is the hope of every young person to achieve their dreams, so our priority is to strengthen public education at all levels. We propose a major reform that includes a national baccalaureate, instead of judging a child's future in just 15 days. The last two years of high school will include multiple exams, reducing stress and cost for families. We will also address inequalities by strengthening teaching within schools and providing a safe school environment with psychological and social support services. We believe in the importance of inclusion and will create special education structures for children on the autism spectrum, rather than just providing allowances. This is the norm in Europe and should be respected by the state to serve every child and family.

For our pensioners, Mr. Tsipras abolished ESAS. We propose a new CSAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners, the abolition of the personal differential from 1/1/2024, and a change in replacement rates. Costed, no-frills, all three can be implemented to support our country's pensioners.

Friends and comrades. Red loans. We insist on protecting primary residences, as we did in 2010, the most critical year against the Troika. It is the duty of all parties to pass a law in Parliament that imposes negotiating rules on funds, so that the priority is to regulate loans and not to annihilate and deflate the Greek economy. We propose reducing the profit margins of banks for consistent borrowers, so that those who need a second chance at dignity and who did not survive the years of the crisis in a fair and objective way can have it. We also propose giving incentives to those who are consistent with lower interest rates, so that we have a framework for dealing with private debt that is fair for all Greeks. Additionally, we propose a solution for borrowers with Swiss francs that will get them out of the deadlock and 120 instalments for EFKA and the tax authorities for all businesses and private individuals, not the mockery that New Democracy made during the election campaign.

Friends, I cannot help but mention the indecency of Mr Tsipras in the last few hours of the election campaign. In his panic, he is trying to wash away his personal responsibility for the red loans scandal. Your opportunism has been condemned, Mr Tsipras, but you remain unrepentant. You are trying to compare one law practice out of thousands that young lawyers do, against the Patsis scandal, which had a collection agency and bought 62.7 million euros worth of loans for just 4 million. This proves that you continue to be a "golden" sponsor of Mitsotakis. However, the Greek people have a memory and remember that he toured Greece and said: "don't pay your red loans, I'll bring seismic activity". The mockery of seismicity has the name of Mr Tsipras, who a year later sold 90 billion euros of 'red loans' to funds and is now blackmailing farmers from the Heraklion Union. The billions worth of red loans in the jars and blackmailing farmers today Heraklion Union here among you are hundreds of farmers of Heraklion Union and they know very well that the fund that blackmails them is what you are their loan. Let us remember them on 25 June to end the mockery of populism, adventurism, and opportunism. That is why I call on the real leftists, the real progressives: Do not be held hostage to a system of power that disregards the interests of the Greek people. Come together, the modern center-left, let us become the party that will confront the maintenance, the anarchocracy, the closed system of power of Mr Mitsotakis. This is PASOK, and it will fight until Sunday to be the big winner again on 25 June.

Friends, let's not dwell on the champion of hypocrisy. Let's talk about the new generation, the faces of our friends, your children, and your grandchildren who want another Greece. We are close to their real problems. That is why we are proposing a social housing program of 150,000 houses for all urban centers and tourist destinations where rents, cost of living, and cost of buying a house have gone through the roof due to short-term rentals and the golden visa. This program will help house the dreams of the new generation of young couples in the country with a low cost of living.

We also propose reducing the tax on labor. The youth and PASOK are back together, making us believe that what they thought would never happen will happen on Sunday night. On Sunday night, the democratic movement founded by Andreas Papandreou is reborn again. For young people, we propose subsidizing social security contributions for 50,000 so that there is full employment. We are tackling the demographic crisis by supporting families and covering all children in crèches and creative activity centers. We owe it to the Greek mother. We propose reducing tax rates for families with two children in line with the standards of the whole of Europe. We give incentives to large families, families with three children, and families with two children. The tax rate has a 3% difference in Greece between a family without children and a family with two children. We propose 8-10% at the European Union average and even more in the future. As in Portugal, the Czech Republic, Ireland, and every country with demographics, we offer the prospect of a Greek family having more children to deactivate the national demographic risk.

Friends and fellow citizens from Heraklion, from the productive island of Crete, I cannot fail to speak up for our farmers. They know very well which party has given them dignity and prospects, because blood is thicker than water. Therefore, we have made it our priority to lower the cost of production, reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs such as animal feed, fuel with zero excise tax, and agricultural oil for the entire period of the energy crisis. We also aim to provide universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation, establish unconfiscated and tax-free zones, and provide subsidies, compensation, and aid to farmers. We will update the regulation on hog insurance to cover all disasters to livestock and crops caused by climate change in the current climate crisis. It is inconceivable that everyone knows the climate crisis is galloping across the Mediterranean, yet the government has not updated the elga to address the current issues of the country's farming community.

Friends, another top issue is the environment and the just transition to green energy. As Socialists, we are fighting for environmental protection and sustainable development. We do not hand over the production of renewable energy to the powerful oligarchs of the country, as New Democracy does. Instead, we invest in productive Greece and energy democracy through the production of energy by energy communities in municipalities, farmers, manufacturers, small and medium-sized enterprises, and local government. This is the case throughout Europe, where governments serve the people and not the few. We have a duty to face the energy poverty that will come in the future and ensure that all producers in creative Greece have stable costs in the coming decades to have a resilient production, economy, and society.

Friends, I cannot fail to mention something that has been served for 9 long years - the European Parliament, Europe. Because I believe in the Europe of peoples and solidarity, not the Europe of the powerful making small states follow the choices of powerful countries in the Union. We are equal partners and it is our duty to ensure that this people play a leading role in European developments. This proud people should not be the tail of the choices of powerful states. That is why, as socialists, we are fighting for the creation of permanent financial instruments that support the productive base of the European countries of the South, in order to address the reduced competitiveness due to high financing costs.

We have a duty to revise the Dublin III regulation so that the burden of asylum is not placed solely on the first country of admission for migrants and refugees, but on the entire European Union. This is solidarity in practice. Of course, New Democracy is celebrating the Council text, and I want the Greek people to know that it is the Council text that New Democracy is celebrating. It includes 30,000 relocations throughout Europe in all European countries, when last year alone there were 960,000 applications. This is where Mr. Mitsotakis is making fun of you, because he did not negotiate a regulation that would create strong solidarity incentives and permanent relocation mechanisms, as he should have done.

Finally, regarding something that has been a significant struggle, the arms embargo on Turkey, it is unthinkable for me that European states should arm an international agitator that undermines the interests and sovereign rights of the Union and neighboring countries. That is why we also support solidarity in matters of security and defense. These countries cannot spend billions on armaments and then arm a country that undermines Greece and Europe. They should learn from Putin's lesson, as Erdogan is simply imitating Putin in the wider region. Therefore, we want a Euroarmy and a common foreign policy on all of Europe's borders, from Finland to Cyprus and Greece, so that everyone, not just the Greek people, can contribute.

Friends, you have truly honored me with your overwhelming presence today. But above all, you have honored the new effort that we are making - renewed, united, and strong - to revive our party, our movement, the Democratic Party. Friends, in this new promising path, you deserve to trust us because you simply deserve better. We pledge that we will not return to toxic confrontation or cowardly populism. We will be a dynamic, pragmatic, strong, and progressive opposition. Our vision is a strong Greece of the future that will stand up to defiance, worthy of the maintenance against anything that does not allow the Greek people to spread their wings. We will stand worthy of the people's verdict against powerful interests that are comfortable with a society of low expectations and an inefficient state, and of course, comfortable with a regime of impunity. We have the political autonomy to confront all the pathologies for our strength. Our strength is the people, not powerful interests. So that is why I call here from Heraklion every progressive, every patriot, every democrat, to unite our struggles, to unite our hopes, to unite our dreams, to unite our forces, and to march together in this new era to serve the people and the country again in a majority first and foremost. We are Greek people, but we do not fight for positions of power. Together, all together, every hour of struggle, we will be the big winners on Sunday night to overturn the toxic correlations. We, friends, are not fighting for positions of power. We are fighting for you, for your families, for future generations. The strong PASOK, which I am sure will be reborn on Sunday evening, will fight inside and outside the Parliament next to the citizen, next to the young, next to the worker, next to the woman, next to every Greek who needs the strong socialist. Our democratic movement.

Because we have a duty to build a Greece of sustainable development, opportunities for all, justice, social cohesion, inclusion against inequalities and discrimination, and the rights of democracy against any kind of authoritarianism. Our vision is a strong Greece of creation, dignity, and social justice. That is why I invite you to walk together. With humanity in the face of cynicism, seriousness in the face of arrogance, certainty in the face of uncertainty, and above all, responsibility in the face of unreliability. This movement will fight the struggles of the concrete and the obvious every day. We will not betray the trust of any page and any Greek that will remind us in Sunday's elections.

Friends from Heraklion, I call on every democrat and every progressive, whatever you voted for last Sunday, to join us and join forces to fight for a new victory, to make a decision for change, for social justice, and for national dignity. So, I call on the citizens of Heraklion, the citizens of Crete, and the citizens of all of Greece to take the struggle into your hands in the remaining hours, in every village, in every city, in every neighborhood, to make the voice of change, the voice of dignity, the voice of progress, and the voice of justice heard. We have a duty to succeed, and we will succeed. We will make PASOK the leading actor again. So, let us return to our homeland. From Monday, PASOK will be the real opponent of maintenance, injustice, and injustice. Let us come together to give the color of hope, the color of social justice, and the color of dignity to Crete so that the political color that suits our island is green again, the green that historically painted the Castle of the democratic party every election night.

So, friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart because I know the struggles you have endured in the last few weeks. I say to you from Heraklion that I will fight, and we will fight, to honor the trust of the Greek people. On Sunday, our party, our movement, has only one option: to win. And we will win with you, the vanguard, as the protagonists. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank my homeland, Heraklion, Crete, and the Castle of the Democratic Party. The Crete of Eleftherios Venizelos and the Democratic Games, the Crete that worshipped Andreas Papandreou, is reborn today in Eleftherias Square, the historic democratic patriotic movement, PASOK.
