So, I pledge here at Democratic Heraklion that we will stand by the citizens every day, embracing their aspirations for better days, dignity, perspective, and justice. Friends, today is a day of remembrance because 25 years have passed since the death of our great founder, Andreas Papandreou. Andreas, whom the Greek people loved like no other, was the politician who sealed the modern history of our country. He fought for social justice and national dignity, guaranteed the prosperity of all Greeks, fought for a Europe of solidarity between peoples, and is the best-known politician since the Second World War, a Greek beyond the borders of Europe.
