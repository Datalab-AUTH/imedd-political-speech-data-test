Friends and fellow citizens from Heraklion, from the productive island of Crete, I cannot fail to speak up for our farmers. They know very well which party has given them dignity and prospects, because blood is thicker than water. Therefore, we have made it our priority to lower the cost of production, reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs such as animal feed, fuel with zero excise tax, and agricultural oil for the entire period of the energy crisis. We also aim to provide universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation, establish unconfiscated and tax-free zones, and provide subsidies, compensation, and aid to farmers. We will update the regulation on hog insurance to cover all disasters to livestock and crops caused by climate change in the current climate crisis. It is inconceivable that everyone knows the climate crisis is galloping across the Mediterranean, yet the government has not updated the elga to address the current issues of the country's farming community.
