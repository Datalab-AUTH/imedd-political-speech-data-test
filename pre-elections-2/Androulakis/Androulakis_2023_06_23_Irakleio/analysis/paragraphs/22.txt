We also propose reducing the tax on labor. The youth and PASOK are back together, making us believe that what they thought would never happen will happen on Sunday night. On Sunday night, the democratic movement founded by Andreas Papandreou is reborn again. For young people, we propose subsidizing social security contributions for 50,000 so that there is full employment. We are tackling the demographic crisis by supporting families and covering all children in cr√®ches and creative activity centers. We owe it to the Greek mother. We propose reducing tax rates for families with two children in line with the standards of the whole of Europe. We give incentives to large families, families with three children, and families with two children. The tax rate has a 3% difference in Greece between a family without children and a family with two children. We propose 8-10% at the European Union average and even more in the future. As in Portugal, the Czech Republic, Ireland, and every country with demographics, we offer the prospect of a Greek family having more children to deactivate the national demographic risk.
