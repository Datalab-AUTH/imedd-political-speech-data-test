Because we have a duty to build a Greece of sustainable development, opportunities for all, justice, social cohesion, inclusion against inequalities and discrimination, and the rights of democracy against any kind of authoritarianism. Our vision is a strong Greece of creation, dignity, and social justice. That is why I invite you to walk together. With humanity in the face of cynicism, seriousness in the face of arrogance, certainty in the face of uncertainty, and above all, responsibility in the face of unreliability. This movement will fight the struggles of the concrete and the obvious every day. We will not betray the trust of any page and any Greek that will remind us in Sunday's elections.
