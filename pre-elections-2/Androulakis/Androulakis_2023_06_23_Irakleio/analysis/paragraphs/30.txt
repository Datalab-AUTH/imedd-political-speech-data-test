Friends from Heraklion, I call on every democrat and every progressive, whatever you voted for last Sunday, to join us and join forces to fight for a new victory, to make a decision for change, for social justice, and for national dignity. So, I call on the citizens of Heraklion, the citizens of Crete, and the citizens of all of Greece to take the struggle into your hands in the remaining hours, in every village, in every city, in every neighborhood, to make the voice of change, the voice of dignity, the voice of progress, and the voice of justice heard. We have a duty to succeed, and we will succeed. We will make PASOK the leading actor again. So, let us return to our homeland. From Monday, PASOK will be the real opponent of maintenance, injustice, and injustice. Let us come together to give the color of hope, the color of social justice, and the color of dignity to Crete so that the political color that suits our island is green again, the green that historically painted the Castle of the democratic party every election night.
