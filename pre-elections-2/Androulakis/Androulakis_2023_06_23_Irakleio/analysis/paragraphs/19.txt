Friends and comrades. Red loans. We insist on protecting primary residences, as we did in 2010, the most critical year against the Troika. It is the duty of all parties to pass a law in Parliament that imposes negotiating rules on funds, so that the priority is to regulate loans and not to annihilate and deflate the Greek economy. We propose reducing the profit margins of banks for consistent borrowers, so that those who need a second chance at dignity and who did not survive the years of the crisis in a fair and objective way can have it. We also propose giving incentives to those who are consistent with lower interest rates, so that we have a framework for dealing with private debt that is fair for all Greeks. Additionally, we propose a solution for borrowers with Swiss francs that will get them out of the deadlock and 120 instalments for EFKA and the tax authorities for all businesses and private individuals, not the mockery that New Democracy made during the election campaign.
