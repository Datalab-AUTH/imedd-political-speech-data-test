Friends, another top issue is the environment and the just transition to green energy. As Socialists, we are fighting for environmental protection and sustainable development. We do not hand over the production of renewable energy to the powerful oligarchs of the country, as New Democracy does. Instead, we invest in productive Greece and energy democracy through the production of energy by energy communities in municipalities, farmers, manufacturers, small and medium-sized enterprises, and local government. This is the case throughout Europe, where governments serve the people and not the few. We have a duty to face the energy poverty that will come in the future and ensure that all producers in creative Greece have stable costs in the coming decades to have a resilient production, economy, and society.
