Friends, Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy aim to identify with stability and responsibility. However, is it stability or a cheap passport policy? It is stability and responsibility to provide 10 billion direct assignments and thousands of post-employment champions, outperforming even SYRIZA. Is it responsible to serve the big and powerful interests of energy producers and suppliers, giving billions of subsidies on the terms of the Greek people? Or is it responsible for the banks to speculate? At a time when our country's purchasing power is third from the bottom in all of Europe? Or is it responsible for the national health care system to be full of lists of shame surgeries? Of course, it is not responsible for the blue guys to take over the state, as we saw in the tragedy of the Tempi River, which overwhelmed the OSE and ERGOSE, and with their omissions in not implementing telecommuting, as the experts' conclusion recently says, to reach a point where 57 lives of our fellow human beings are lost unjustly. Or is it responsible to play with the institutions, with democracy and the rule of law, to set up a surveillance agency, a parastatal mechanism? These are things of the past, and we will consign them to the past. We have a duty to the Greek people to close the books, to settle accounts with maintenance and with the forces that despise your interests, that despise your hopes.
