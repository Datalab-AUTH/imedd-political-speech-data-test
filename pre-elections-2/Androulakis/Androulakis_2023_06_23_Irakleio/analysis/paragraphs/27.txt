Finally, regarding something that has been a significant struggle, the arms embargo on Turkey, it is unthinkable for me that European states should arm an international agitator that undermines the interests and sovereign rights of the Union and neighboring countries. That is why we also support solidarity in matters of security and defense. These countries cannot spend billions on armaments and then arm a country that undermines Greece and Europe. They should learn from Putin's lesson, as Erdogan is simply imitating Putin in the wider region. Therefore, we want a Euroarmy and a common foreign policy on all of Europe's borders, from Finland to Cyprus and Greece, so that everyone, not just the Greek people, can contribute.
