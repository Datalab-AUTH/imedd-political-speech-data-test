In health, the man who passed away 27 years ago today is the man who, together with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos, gave birth to the National Health System, which served ordinary Greek citizens for decades. This child of PASOK today is in dire straits because some people do not want to support it. And there is no longer any argument that the state has no money, because it has the Recovery Fund. Why was there a Recovery Fund? It was for the pandemic. Instead of giving 8-10% of the Recovery Fund, as Portugal and Italy did, they gave 2-4%. As a result, we are experiencing tragic events in the ambulance service because 700 rescuers are missing to cover the shifts. But also, the embarrassing waiting lists for an operation. It is outrageous what I was told at the Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki: 3,500 of our fellow citizens are waiting to be operated on because there are only 7 anaesthetists instead of the 28 that are provided. We have a duty to create a strong network of primary health care throughout Greece, on the islands, on the mainland, in the big cities. We owe it to our doctors to get better salaries. Not to study here and go abroad. And of course, we owe it to all health workers to join the heavy and unhealthy, not the mockery of the pandemic that was rewarded with clapping and not a policy they deserve.
