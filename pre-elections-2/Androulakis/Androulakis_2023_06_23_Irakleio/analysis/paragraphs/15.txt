Friends, in the face of the employer's impunity, which is reinforced by the policies of New Democracy, we promote the new regulation of labor relations through social dialogue. We aim for work with rules and security, decent wages determined through free collective bargaining, and strong control mechanisms that protect the rights of workers.
