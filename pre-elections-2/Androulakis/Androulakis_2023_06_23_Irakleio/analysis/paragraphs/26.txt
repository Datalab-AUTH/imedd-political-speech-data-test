We have a duty to revise the Dublin III regulation so that the burden of asylum is not placed solely on the first country of admission for migrants and refugees, but on the entire European Union. This is solidarity in practice. Of course, New Democracy is celebrating the Council text, and I want the Greek people to know that it is the Council text that New Democracy is celebrating. It includes 30,000 relocations throughout Europe in all European countries, when last year alone there were 960,000 applications. This is where Mr. Mitsotakis is making fun of you, because he did not negotiate a regulation that would create strong solidarity incentives and permanent relocation mechanisms, as he should have done.
