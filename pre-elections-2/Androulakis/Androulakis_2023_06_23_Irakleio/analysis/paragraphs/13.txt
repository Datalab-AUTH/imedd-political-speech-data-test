Friends and acquaintances throughout the country say one word to me: Dignity. The younger generation is hungry for meritocracy, both those who have stayed here and those who have left. They want a Greece of transparency and meritocracy, and we have a duty to fight for this Greece. Mr. Mitsotakis came as the new thing, as a European liberal. Did he bring meritocracy? Or did he, like his predecessors, make the state the prey of Maximos in order to appoint his own political allies?
