Friends, I cannot help but mention the indecency of Mr Tsipras in the last few hours of the election campaign. In his panic, he is trying to wash away his personal responsibility for the red loans scandal. Your opportunism has been condemned, Mr Tsipras, but you remain unrepentant. You are trying to compare one law practice out of thousands that young lawyers do, against the Patsis scandal, which had a collection agency and bought 62.7 million euros worth of loans for just 4 million. This proves that you continue to be a "golden" sponsor of Mitsotakis. However, the Greek people have a memory and remember that he toured Greece and said: "don't pay your red loans, I'll bring seismic activity". The mockery of seismicity has the name of Mr Tsipras, who a year later sold 90 billion euros of 'red loans' to funds and is now blackmailing farmers from the Heraklion Union. The billions worth of red loans in the jars and blackmailing farmers today Heraklion Union here among you are hundreds of farmers of Heraklion Union and they know very well that the fund that blackmails them is what you are their loan. Let us remember them on 25 June to end the mockery of populism, adventurism, and opportunism. That is why I call on the real leftists, the real progressives: Do not be held hostage to a system of power that disregards the interests of the Greek people. Come together, the modern center-left, let us become the party that will confront the maintenance, the anarchocracy, the closed system of power of Mr Mitsotakis. This is PASOK, and it will fight until Sunday to be the big winner again on 25 June.
