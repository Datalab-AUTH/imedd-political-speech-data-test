So, friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart because I know the struggles you have endured in the last few weeks. I say to you from Heraklion that I will fight, and we will fight, to honor the trust of the Greek people. On Sunday, our party, our movement, has only one option: to win. And we will win with you, the vanguard, as the protagonists. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank my homeland, Heraklion, Crete, and the Castle of the Democratic Party. The Crete of Eleftherios Venizelos and the Democratic Games, the Crete that worshipped Andreas Papandreou, is reborn today in Eleftherias Square, the historic democratic patriotic movement, PASOK.
