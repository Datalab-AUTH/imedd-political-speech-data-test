Friends, education, and public education are important to us as socialists. We believe that public education is the hope of every young person to achieve their dreams, so our priority is to strengthen public education at all levels. We propose a major reform that includes a national baccalaureate, instead of judging a child's future in just 15 days. The last two years of high school will include multiple exams, reducing stress and cost for families. We will also address inequalities by strengthening teaching within schools and providing a safe school environment with psychological and social support services. We believe in the importance of inclusion and will create special education structures for children on the autism spectrum, rather than just providing allowances. This is the norm in Europe and should be respected by the state to serve every child and family.
