We propose that all positions in hospitals, organizations, and everywhere else be selected through an open international competition within two months of the next government being sworn in. All Greeks who are worthy of serving the public interest will submit their CVs, and an independent authority will choose who will serve the people. Even when the Pappas and Demetriades of the day pick up the phone, they will be told "we don't serve Tsipras and Mitsotakis" and hang up on them. This is my goal for a normal European country where the tenant of Maximos has limits to their power and is not uncontrollable.
