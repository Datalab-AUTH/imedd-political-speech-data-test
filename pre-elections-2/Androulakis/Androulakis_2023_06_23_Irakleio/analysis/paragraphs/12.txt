Friends, or rather, fellow citizens. New Democracy allows for the creation of inflation, obscenity, and speculation. It pretends to deal accurately with all kinds of temporary passes. However, real wages have fallen by 7.4%, not according to Mr. Skertzos, New Democracy MPs, or some morning news, but according to official figures from the OECD and the European Commission, which we trust. They continue to overtax the people, claiming to have reduced direct taxes while increasing indirect taxes. They have reduced taxes less for the vulnerable and middle classes, and more for the powerful. They take many times more from the pockets of the middle and lower classes through indirect taxes, such as VAT and excise duty. In just two years, these taxes have taken in excess of five billion more than the budgeted revenue, making two-thirds of the state's revenue from indirect taxes that hit the weak and increase inequalities. Therefore, we are pushing for substantial measures that protect households, such as reducing taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, with substantial controls on the market, and reducing production costs for farmers. These are permanent measures that protect dignity, not the mocking temporary passes of New Democracy.
