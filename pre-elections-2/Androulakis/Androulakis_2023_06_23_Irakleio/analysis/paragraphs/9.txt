Friends, PASOK's battle is to have a strong and credible opposition, one that will call a spade a spade without weighing the political cost. So let us see what the vision of this party is. The New Democracy government presents an idyllic situation for the economy, but the public debt has increased by some 50 billion. The current account deficit is the largest since 2010, at 12% last year and an estimated 9% this year. And we are told that this is happening all over Europe because of the pandemic energy crisis? No, they are lying. Portugal, with similar economic problems and sizes, had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year. This is the fiscal populism of Mr. Mitsotakis, who is leading the country into new adventures, in perfect imitation of Mr. Karamanlis.
