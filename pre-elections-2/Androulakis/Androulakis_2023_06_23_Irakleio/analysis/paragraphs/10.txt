The Recovery Fund was given so that we can make good use of its valuable resources. However, too much goes to the few and powerful, too little to cooperatives, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, and stockbreeders, and too little to productive Greece. Therefore, we propose another model of development that prioritizes sustainable growth, the extroversion of the economy, and good jobs for our children so that they can stay here, create, and grow. We propose a competitive growth model, made in Greece, that redirects the resources of the Recovery Fund based on a national development plan. This plan promotes production that supports innovative value-added investments and links tourism with agri-food and manufacturing. We will not celebrate how many millions came to Greece, but we will celebrate the exports that helped make those millions, featuring Greek domestic products instead of foreign ones. This is the future of productive Greece, where tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing build a strong and resilient Greece that can withstand global turbulence.
