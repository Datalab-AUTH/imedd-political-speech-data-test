Friends, today we are concluding a long campaign here in Democratic Heraklion, during which I met thousands of people in every part of the country. These people expect a lot from us and we have a duty to offer them strong hope. We have a duty to serve the people and the country, to serve the needs of the Greek people for meritocracy, transparency, strong public education, and strong public health. Our young people need skills for the future, and this party will faithfully serve the younger generations. We have a duty to address the high cost of living. For a new Greece, we will fight every day for progress, for creation, for a strong Greece in Europe, for leadership. Friends, we have a duty to face the high cost of living that burdens the Greek family, to support young people, and give prospects for good jobs. For all this, I ask you to fight. For all this, I ask you to succeed on Sunday and to be stronger than ever before.
