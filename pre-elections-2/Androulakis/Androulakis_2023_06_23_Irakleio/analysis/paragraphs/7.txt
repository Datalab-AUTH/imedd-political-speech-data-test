Friends, PASOK is here in Syntagma Square, in the Square of Change, and on Sunday night we will be looking at all of you with a weak message of victory from all corners of the country, with each and every one of you as the protagonist. Friends, on Sunday night we have before us the opportunity for change, which will come through daily struggle alongside citizens, the people, women, workers, and the new generation. We embrace the aspirations of our people for better days and serve them faithfully, clashing with interests and everything that prevents Greece from becoming a normal European country. So on June 25th, we have a decisive battle ahead of us. PASOK has a duty to grow stronger to support New Democracy in the next elections in opposition. Step by step, we will become the majority progressive movement of Greece again. This, Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis, is the sole objective of the struggle we are waging every day in every village, town, and neighborhood, so that PASOK can become its genuine, historical, social opponent. We therefore have a duty to overturn the divisions and disappointments that have affected the Greeks, and to break the mechanism of fear. Because the result of New Democracy is not the result of its contribution to the people, but the mechanism of fear of the worst. We give hope for the best, quickly and dynamically. The sooner PASOK becomes stronger, the sooner it will become a side-show of maintenance.
