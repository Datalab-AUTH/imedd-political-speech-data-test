Friends, I cannot fail to mention something that has been served for 9 long years - the European Parliament, Europe. Because I believe in the Europe of peoples and solidarity, not the Europe of the powerful making small states follow the choices of powerful countries in the Union. We are equal partners and it is our duty to ensure that this people play a leading role in European developments. This proud people should not be the tail of the choices of powerful states. That is why, as socialists, we are fighting for the creation of permanent financial instruments that support the productive base of the European countries of the South, in order to address the reduced competitiveness due to high financing costs.
