Friends, you have truly honored me with your overwhelming presence today. But above all, you have honored the new effort that we are making - renewed, united, and strong - to revive our party, our movement, the Democratic Party. Friends, in this new promising path, you deserve to trust us because you simply deserve better. We pledge that we will not return to toxic confrontation or cowardly populism. We will be a dynamic, pragmatic, strong, and progressive opposition. Our vision is a strong Greece of the future that will stand up to defiance, worthy of the maintenance against anything that does not allow the Greek people to spread their wings. We will stand worthy of the people's verdict against powerful interests that are comfortable with a society of low expectations and an inefficient state, and of course, comfortable with a regime of impunity. We have the political autonomy to confront all the pathologies for our strength. Our strength is the people, not powerful interests. So that is why I call here from Heraklion every progressive, every patriot, every democrat, to unite our struggles, to unite our hopes, to unite our dreams, to unite our forces, and to march together in this new era to serve the people and the country again in a majority first and foremost. We are Greek people, but we do not fight for positions of power. Together, all together, every hour of struggle, we will be the big winners on Sunday night to overturn the toxic correlations. We, friends, are not fighting for positions of power. We are fighting for you, for your families, for future generations. The strong PASOK, which I am sure will be reborn on Sunday evening, will fight inside and outside the Parliament next to the citizen, next to the young, next to the worker, next to the woman, next to every Greek who needs the strong socialist. Our democratic movement.
