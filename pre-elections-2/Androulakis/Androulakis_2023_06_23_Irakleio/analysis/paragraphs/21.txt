Friends, let's not dwell on the champion of hypocrisy. Let's talk about the new generation, the faces of our friends, your children, and your grandchildren who want another Greece. We are close to their real problems. That is why we are proposing a social housing program of 150,000 houses for all urban centers and tourist destinations where rents, cost of living, and cost of buying a house have gone through the roof due to short-term rentals and the golden visa. This program will help house the dreams of the new generation of young couples in the country with a low cost of living.
