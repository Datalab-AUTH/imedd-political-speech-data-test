Friends, for this Sunday let's not have 4 more wasted years of an ineffective opposition and a government whose weaknesses and arrogance will increase day by day. We wish we could sanctify. Mr. Mitsotakis should not let us forget the wiretapping and cover-up, which reminded us of the worst of Sakkos and New Democracy. It is rather their family tradition to violate human rights and the separation of powers.
