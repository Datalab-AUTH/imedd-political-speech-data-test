But friends, it is deeply unreliable. New Democracy promises increases in private sector wages up to 25%, but in Brussels a few days ago, where Mr Mitsotakis' tricks don't work, he spoke of only 13%. As Mr Skylakakis revealed, there is no Messiah. In Patras, they were waiting in vain for Mr Mitsotakis. He cannot work miracles. The only miracle is to deceive the Greek people once again. That is why I say you deserve more.
