People of Heraklion, people of Crete, I am deeply touched by your warm welcome here in my homeland, which has been identified with democratic struggles since the time of Eleftherios Venizelos. Here, from the great castle of the Democratic Party, memory meets hope today. Friends, in this very square a few weeks ago, I pledged to you that on May 21st, we would be victorious. Today, I pledge to you that on Sunday evening, June 25th, we will pick up the thread of history again. So, here's why. For this, then. Here, from Democratic Heraklion, I call on every patriot, every progressive, every Democrat, whatever party they voted for on May 21st, to trust our movement, to trust us on this new path, on renewal, on hope, on dignity, on perspective. PASOK is here, united and strong, with the new generation in the lead, with the Greek people in the lead. We are turning the page as if we were becoming the protagonists.
