Friends, PASOK is well aware of the mistakes it has made in the past. It is not an unrepentant party. That is why I committed myself from the very first moment of my election to bring a new political ethos to the country and to build a new relationship of trust, especially with the younger generations who abhor parties as vulgar clientelistic mechanisms. This is why I said, and I believe that we should all do this in our country, that universal meritocracy in the selection of hospital and organization governors was tragically demonstrated in the unbelievable event, in the unbelievable tragedy of Tempe, where party members of New Democracy with no knowledge of trains, no knowledge of the OSE, held critical positions, but this happens throughout the public sector. So what are we saying? Every government, as soon as it is formed, for 2 months to hold an open international competition, to submit the CVs of Greeks from inside and outside the country, to be selected by an independent organization, by an independent group of scientists, and with a five-year term of office to serve you and not the respective Mansion of Maximou, as a hard clientele mechanism, a personal mechanism of a state prey of the respective Prime Minister. And of course, transparency everywhere.
