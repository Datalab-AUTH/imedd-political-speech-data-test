And I say this because the economic data is revealing. Of course, the economists, the experts, those who know things well, are hiding. We don't see them on TV anymore. Where are they to talk about the national debt? Where are they to talk about the external deficit? Where are they to talk about the trade deficit? About the structure of the tax system? Mitsotakis has loaded 50 billion in new debt on your backs, your children's, and future generations in 4 years. The external deficit is the largest since 2010. And when they say that this is happening all over Europe, they are lying. It is not happening all over Europe. Portugal, with similar issues as Greece, had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year. Greece had a 12% deficit last year and a 9% deficit this year. Why is this debate not taking place? And some people ask us where we are going to get the money to support education. Where will we find the money to support health? And we say to them, let Mr Mitsotakis first tell us what he has done with the 50 billion in debt that he has put on the backs of the Greek people. Because I have never seen anywhere in the world where the opposition wants the opposition to apologize instead of the New Democracy government.
