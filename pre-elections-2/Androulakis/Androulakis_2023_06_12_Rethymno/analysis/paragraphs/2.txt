That is why we have a duty to revive the movement of Andreas Papandreou so that there is a choice of dignity, a choice of progress for every Greek. And I call on every Greek woman, every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive, from the democratic Rethymno, from Crete, the historical castle of the democratic party, to come and embrace our new effort. June 25, the goal is one: PASOK to become again the great movement of changes, of reforms that will give the Greek people a genuine hopeful perspective. We are tired of the years of toxicity, internet gangs, wishful thinking, populism, low quality of public debate. With our program, with our specific positions, with our proposals on the welfare state, on the economy, on taxation, on the revival of the agricultural sector, on competitive production, we have a duty to prove that there is a credible progressive force. And this is our great ambition, on election night, to be a strong, credible progressive force that can show the other way against maintenance, against the client state, against meritocracy, against opacity.
