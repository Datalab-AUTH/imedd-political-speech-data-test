What do we say? Not 2-4% of the Recovery Fund but 8-10%. Besides, the Portuguese, Spanish, and Italians with similar problems are giving more than that to have an extensive primary health care network. This was lacking in the pandemic era, so the wave-breaker is the public hospital and not the primary care, as in the rest of Europe. Salaries at the European Union average for health workers. We cannot continue with what is happening today, with doctors studying in Greece and leaving for Germany and France where there is a shortage of doctors. There must be salary incentives. And, of course, the mockery of heavy and unhealthy work must end. Our health workers should finally be included in the heavy and unhealthy category, as they deserve and as they should be, and as some people have committed themselves to, but have been fooled as thousands of Greeks have been fooled. And I am talking about the government of the New Democracy.
