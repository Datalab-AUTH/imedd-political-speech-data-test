And a song for our great creator, Yannis Markopoulos, who passed away yesterday. Dedicated to Yannis, the post-independence great Greek, a great Cretan who inspired many, many generations of Greeks with his work, a work that embraced the democratic struggles, our roots. We wish him a good journey. To his family, we extend our warmest condolences, and we close this gathering with a favorite song of the great creator.
