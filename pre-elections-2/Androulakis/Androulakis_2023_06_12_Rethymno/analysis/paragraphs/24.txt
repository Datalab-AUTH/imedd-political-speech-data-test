What are we saying? We are putting closed and new homes into a social pool with a target of 150,000 homes in 4 years, using a Recovery Fund, tax incentives, and reconstruction incentives. These homes will be used to house young couples and vulnerable Greeks with low rent. When these individuals are able to stand on their own feet, other families can move in. This is social justice and support for Greeks, rather than creating customers through low interest loans. This approach is being implemented in all European countries. Mr. Mitsotakis' approach has already failed.
