Friends, beyond taxation, health, and education, there are other significant issues that concern pensioners. We are not being catered to. We propose three measures, costing one billion 130 million. Firstly, the introduction of a new ESAS to replace the one abolished by Mr Tsipras, benefiting 350,000 low pensioners. Secondly, the abolition of the personal differential from 1/1/24 for four years, with a fiscal impact. In the fourth year, there is no cost to the budget, and the unfair provisions for disability and widow's pensions no longer exist, allowing those in need to receive the pensions they are entitled to. Civil servants need to catch up with inflation, which costs a billion 200 million. All these interventions, totaling 2.3 billion, are reasonable. We are not discussing the thirteenth pension, which costs 2.7 billion, as we do not want any citizen to feel that PASOK in this new era has made promises it cannot keep to win their vote. We speak with dignity and logic so that every citizen knows that PASOK wants to support them as best it can, but always in a fiscally secure way.
