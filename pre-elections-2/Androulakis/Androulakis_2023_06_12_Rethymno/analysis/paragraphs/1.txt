I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome. Today, we are sending a message of victory from Rethymno with the clear aim of giving Crete back the political color that suits it - the green of the Democratic Party, the green of hope, the green of optimism, the green of dignity. We are only 15 days away. PASOK is here, united and strong, the great winner on June 25th. The first step has been taken. We are going strong again to become the great rival of New Democracy. Friends, there are less than two weeks left, and we have only one road, only one path to travel - the path of daily struggle, of daily effort, home by home, city by city, village by village, in every workplace. We must ensure that the voice of progress, the voice of reason, the voice of responsibility prevails against the toxicity and division that New Democracy and SYRIZA have offered in recent years. But you know very well that Mr. Mitsotakis has made himself comfortable. He settled for an opposition sponsor, a golden sponsor. There is no other way to interpret the result after four years of great social inequalities, undermining of the welfare state, extensive corruption phenomena such as that of Mr. Patsis and others, wiretapping, the parastatal of wiretapping, the cover-up, the games with justice. Instead of New Democracy going down, New Democracy is going up. Why did this happen? Did the people see their lives getting better? The people feared the worst, and we are here to choose not based on fear but based on hope and the prospects of every family in the younger generations.
