Friends, finally, on the subject of the agricultural sector. In the last few days, during the week before last, I was here in Rethymnon. I visited the agricultural cooperative with its famous cheeses. Prior to that, I had been to Chios, to the Mastic Research Centre with its highly specialised products. I also visited the Toplou monastery with its standardised wines and oil. Lastly, I went to the Honey Museum in Rhodes. I want to send a message with this experience. This message is for tourism entrepreneurs, but also for the country in general. Tourism does not mean celebrating when 25 million or 30 million travellers come to Greece. Tourism means setting measurable targets so that everyone wins - farmers, ranchers, processors, and workers. This is value-added tourism. This is not an invention of PASOK. Italy has been doing this for years, Spain has been doing this for years, and Portugal has been doing this since the economic crisis. When you visit their homelands, you taste their domestic products, become their ambassador, and then look for these products on the shelves of supermarkets all over Europe and the world. This is our vision for value-added tourism that joins forces with manufacturing and the primary sector. We can create new jobs all over Greece so that Greek children can stay here with good wages. We can have exports, a productive economy, and a strong society.
