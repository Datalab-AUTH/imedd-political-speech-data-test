Friends, I cannot avoid mentioning the agricultural issues here in Rethymno. We are the party that has supported the peasantry since the 1980s, giving them dignity and prospects. Because blood is thicker than water, PASOK is here again to embrace the rural world of the country, providing incentives for competitiveness, production, and prospects so that our villages and the Greek countryside can thrive. The rural income lost in recent years amounts to 1.3 billion. 70% of our farmers have significant debts to public funds, EFKA, and banks. What are we proposing? We will reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs, with zero excise duty on agricultural oil during the crisis. We will implement two measures for agricultural supplies and oil.
