Friends, regarding the demographic, I mentioned our tax policies earlier, but that is not all. We have a duty to support the family and the Greek mother. With a strong PASOK, I pledge that no child or family will be left out of nurseries and creative employment centers. This is how we support the Greek family in practice. Additionally, the amendment we proposed before the elections will be reintroduced after these elections to increase maternity allowance for freelance women.
