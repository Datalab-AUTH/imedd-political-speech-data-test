This party is not begging the far right. It is the democratic party with its principles and its history, and we are the ones who, throughout the years of the post-independence period, have stood against the extremes and maintained our position. We are the party of social justice and national dignity. We are the PASOK that was founded to serve the people and the homeland, and I call on you to take this PASOK in your hands and fight together in the next 14 days. If we fight together, you can be sure that on the evening of June 25th, the sun of PASOK will rise again as the sun of justice and perspective. The sun of hope will once again shine over the country. There are 14 days left, let us fight united to be the great victors. June 25th is a milestone day, together we will win. Bless you and thank you from the bottom of my heart. Friends, in closing, I want you to know that this relationship that began with each and every one of you individually is an unbreakable political relationship that no one will be able to undermine. It is a relationship of trust. We are not going to disappoint any Greek woman or Greek man who will support us on June 25th. We will stand by the citizen inside and outside the Greek parliament and we will fight for their real concerns. This is the people's movement of PASOK, and this is the movement I want the young people of our country to embrace again. So please give it a fight. With struggle, we will be the great winners. With a fight, we will achieve what two years ago seemed impossible, the great victory for the rebirth of the democratic party. Be well. I thank you here in Rethymno from the depths of my heart. The message today is also a message of victory, from all corners of the country. Be well. Crete, the castle of PASOK, the Crete that loved Andreas Papandreou, is once again at the forefront of the struggle for renaissance. Be well and good strength.
