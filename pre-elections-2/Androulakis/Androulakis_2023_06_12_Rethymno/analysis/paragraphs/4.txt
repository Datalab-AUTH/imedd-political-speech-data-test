And we say this because we, with our patriotic character and our sense of responsibility, have demonstrated the potential for unity among the people of Thrace, both Christians and Muslims. Andreas Papandreou broke down the barriers of shame, and Costas Simitis, with George Papandreou as Foreign Minister, enacted the 5 percent law that enabled hundreds of thousands of Greek Muslims to attend universities. After 20 years, the number of scientists in Thrace has increased fivefold. This party offers perspective and is committed to respecting human rights. It is a promising party of progress that stands in opposition to the unacceptable petty party attitudes that threaten to divide Greece for the benefit of small groups engaged in everyday political action. We envision Greece as a normal European country, not one that is ready to be divided at the slightest provocation.
