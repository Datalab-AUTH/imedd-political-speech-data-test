Friends, in the last few days we have witnessed an unthinkable political conflict between New Democracy and Syriza. They have shown through this conflict that they are profoundly reckless. In the face of their ephemeral political interests and petty party interests, they do not even consider national issues, such as the sensitive issue of Thrace and the Greek Muslims. What have we seen? On the one hand, Mrs Bakoyannis speaking in a village in Komotini as if we were in the 1950s, with extreme right-wing despotic speech towards Greek citizens. We condemn this speech. It has nothing to do with a modern European country, gentlemen of the New Democracy. On the other hand, Mr Tsipras does not make things clear. Could it be that there are members of the Greek Parliament who are questioning the Treaty of Lausanne? But the Lausanne Treaty speaks of Greek Muslims. So let us be clear, let us stop the games of New Democracy and Syriza, the cheap election games.
