We have a different plan than that of New Democracy, a plan that serves the many, the producers, and not the oligarchs of the country. Mr. Mitsotakis constantly caresses the issue of energy. Look at what we heard when we talked about taxing the excess profits of power generators, suppliers, and banks. Shouldn't their excess profits be taxed? They received billions of euros in subsidies, and then we saw it in the PPC tariff, which we paid. Shouldn't they pay something too? What I want to say is, when the income of the Greek people fell in 2022, and real wages fell by 7%, how did they manage to triple their profits in the midst of an energy crisis? So, it is fair to tax their excess profits, and anyone who speculates at the expense of the country, the middle class, and the Greek people should know that the state is here to regulate the market and not to have a market that is a jungle for the few at the expense of the many. On this issue too, social democracy has solutions. It sets rules and regulates the market. It does not allow powerful interests to speculate at the expense of the people.
