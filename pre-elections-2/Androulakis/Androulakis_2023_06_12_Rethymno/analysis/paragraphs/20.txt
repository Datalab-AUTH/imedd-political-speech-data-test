Another huge issue that concerns both Crete and the rest of Greece is private debt. In the past, some people have said, "Don't pay, we will bring Sesakhtia." These were the golden sponsors of New Democracy who went to villages and towns and said, "Don't pay your loans, we will find arrangements." In 2015, as soon as they became the government, they sold billions of red loans with a law of SYRIZA-Independent Greeks to the funds' crows. As a result, cooperatives, individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, and businesses are in a dire situation, blackmailed by these profit-making institutions.
