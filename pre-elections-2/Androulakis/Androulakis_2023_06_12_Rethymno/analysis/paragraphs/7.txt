Friends, we have a duty to talk about the big issue concerning the National Health System. We have seen what has happened in recent weeks with the ambulance service in Kos and New Makri. Why have we not supported the National Health System? Once upon a time, with the memoranda, too many resources were cut, and often unfairly. But today, with the Recovery Fund, with 20 billion in subsidies and 10 billion in loans, the country could have afforded to hire 700 rescuers so that in 67 places throughout the country, as I was informed by the management of the EKAB, there is only one ambulance for twenty-four hours, 3 eight-hour shifts, when hundreds of thousands of tourists are waiting in Kos and in places in mainland Greece with similar problems. It could have afforded to hire 1000 university police officers, who are nowhere to be found today, when they could have put private companies in charge of guarding the universities through a tender and recruited in the areas where the welfare state is hurting, in health and education. This is our difference in values from New Democracy. We, with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos, founded the National Health System, and they are undermining it to the greatest extent possible. And they tell you that this issue of the National Health System is timeless. That's not what the evidence says. The figures say that in recent years we've been third in private health care spending across Europe. The figures have been disputed until recently by New Democracy officials on television. The day before yesterday, new figures came out. The country's position has worsened, second only to the Bulgarians in private spending, and the Greeks in the 27 countries of the European Union pay such a high proportion of private health spending because the NHS has collapsed. So, is this social justice?
