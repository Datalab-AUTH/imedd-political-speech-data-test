And of course, there is the social housing program. Mr. Mitsotakis tried to imitate our proposal. But do you know what it reveals? That he disregards the great problems of the younger generation. When other states included tens of thousands of houses in the Recovery Fund, he included only 100 houses in the Recovery Fund, 70 in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. And when PASOK started talking about this issue, he said, "I will make a program." What is his program? He gives low-interest loans for young people to buy houses. If you ask, many have been approved to get loans, but the price of mobile phones today is higher than the loan amount, so this is again for the few, the haves.
