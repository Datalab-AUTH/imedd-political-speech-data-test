Friends, we have a duty to speak up about everything - taxation, the economy, and competitiveness. We're being lied to when we're told that proposing a tax on the wealthy is a "tax storm." What we're proposing only affects 0.02% of the Greek population. How many of you can pass on up to 4.8 million euros tax-free to your children? Who does this policy really benefit? In a bankrupt Greece with hundreds of thousands of Greek children leaving the country, is it right that oligarchs can transfer up to 4.8 million euros tax-free? This only benefits 1000 families. We propose a cap of â‚¬800,000 per child or for both parents. This applies to everyone, including the middle class and those with higher incomes, except for the oligarchs. Is this really a "tax storm"? When we're asked what we'll do with this money, our first priority is demographics - our villages and towns. Our population is aging, and we need to do something about it. We should follow the example of other European countries. In Greece, families without children and families with two children only have a 3-point difference in tax rates. The European average is 10 points. Why is this? Because Europe as a whole is facing a demographic crisis and can no longer afford to give tax breaks for not just 3 or 4 children, but even 2 children. Why can't we do the same? We're committed to tax fairness and supporting families, which means at least an 8-10 point reduction in taxes for families with 2 children. This is how we support families in our country, just like other states such as Portugal (10-11 points), the Czech Republic (14 points), and Ireland (15 points) support their demographics.
