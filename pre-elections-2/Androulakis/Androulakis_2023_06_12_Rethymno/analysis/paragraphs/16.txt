Go ahead. Reduce social security contributions. Only then will young people learn that they can work without moonlighting. This is how our funds will be able to stand and how we will also get decent wages with lower social security contributions. These policies are not policies for the few. They are not a tax storm, they are social justice. It is just that those who are hitting PASOK and these proposals are the ones who will pay, the thousands of families that Mr Mitsotakis faithfully serves. We serve the country, we serve the Greek people, and we have other priorities. And of course, VAT on basic goods. We heard that too, populism. But is it populism to reduce VAT on a few basic goods so that the most vulnerable Greeks can buy their milk, their bread, and is it not populism that New Democracy in its 2019 program talks about reduced VAT in both categories?
