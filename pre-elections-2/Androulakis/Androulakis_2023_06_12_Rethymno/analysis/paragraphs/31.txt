But for Mr Tsipras, who says it is the fault of PASOK, KKE, and the simple proportional representation won by New Democracy, everyone is to blame but him. Let's give up. Did we have a simple proportional representation in 2019? But 19 lost in national and European elections, and if it wasn't for a top local government official, Stavros Arnaoutakis, the whole of Greece would have been blue in 2019. So which PASOK is to blame and which KKE? The golden sponsor was populism and the disastrous governance of '15-'19 by Mr. Tsipras. Finally, take responsibility and let this party chart the new course and become the real opponent of New Democracy again so that there can be a strong and credible opposition, not the populists who learned with the toxic gangs and the word of division. But do you know? Every politician in his political life has turning points. The turning point for Mr. Tsipras was a few days before the national elections on May 25 when he revealed why he did not vote for the amendment to prevent the neo-Nazi killers of Pavlos Fyssas from taking part in the elections. He revealed it by saying that the misguided voters of the prisoner who allowed New Democracy to take a vacation from prison should vote for Syriza.
