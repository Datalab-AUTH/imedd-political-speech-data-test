Secondly, priority is given to renewable energy parks for farmers, cooperatives, municipalities, and energy communities all over Greece, not just for the powerful at the expense of the democratization of electricity production. We say this because how can we have stable production costs if all this new development, new industry, and new electricity production is given only to the powerful? This only happens here. In all European countries, whether with small energy communities of producers, processors, and cooperatives, or with municipal energy communities, or with photovoltaics on roofs, they shield the vulnerable from energy poverty and the producer from rising production costs.
