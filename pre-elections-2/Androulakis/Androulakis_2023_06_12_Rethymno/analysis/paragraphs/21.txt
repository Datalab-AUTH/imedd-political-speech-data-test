There must be universal protection of the main house for the vulnerable and the middle class. This is what PASOK did in 2010 to defend our weakest fellow citizens. Secondly, we must pass a law that sets criteria for negotiating with funds. These criteria should lead to regulation, and not leave the market unregulated. If we don't regulate the market, funds will drive thousands of businesses and cooperatives to extinction. We also believe that the banks' profit margin for consistent borrowers should be reduced. This will give all those who have not endured an incentive to have a second chance at dignity. It will also give those who have endured an incentive to continue to pay their loans. Finally, there are the 120 payments. If you go to the city of Rethymno tomorrow morning and ask small and medium-sized businesses, "Did you join the 120 instalments made by New Democracy?" You can be sure that they are counted on the fingers of one hand. This is simply not an arrangement for many, but for very few. We are committing ourselves to 120 instalments for everyone, for the tax authorities and the National Social Security Fund. This will regulate the market and provide liquidity for businesses. Our aim is to keep the small and medium-sized enterprise standing, with a perspective, and to keep it on its feet.
