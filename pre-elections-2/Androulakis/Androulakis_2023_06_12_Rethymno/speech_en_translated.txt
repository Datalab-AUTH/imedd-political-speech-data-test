I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome. Today, we are sending a message of victory from Rethymno with the clear aim of giving Crete back the political color that suits it - the green of the Democratic Party, the green of hope, the green of optimism, the green of dignity. We are only 15 days away. PASOK is here, united and strong, the great winner on June 25th. The first step has been taken. We are going strong again to become the great rival of New Democracy. Friends, there are less than two weeks left, and we have only one road, only one path to travel - the path of daily struggle, of daily effort, home by home, city by city, village by village, in every workplace. We must ensure that the voice of progress, the voice of reason, the voice of responsibility prevails against the toxicity and division that New Democracy and SYRIZA have offered in recent years. But you know very well that Mr. Mitsotakis has made himself comfortable. He settled for an opposition sponsor, a golden sponsor. There is no other way to interpret the result after four years of great social inequalities, undermining of the welfare state, extensive corruption phenomena such as that of Mr. Patsis and others, wiretapping, the parastatal of wiretapping, the cover-up, the games with justice. Instead of New Democracy going down, New Democracy is going up. Why did this happen? Did the people see their lives getting better? The people feared the worst, and we are here to choose not based on fear but based on hope and the prospects of every family in the younger generations.

That is why we have a duty to revive the movement of Andreas Papandreou so that there is a choice of dignity, a choice of progress for every Greek. And I call on every Greek woman, every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive, from the democratic Rethymno, from Crete, the historical castle of the democratic party, to come and embrace our new effort. June 25, the goal is one: PASOK to become again the great movement of changes, of reforms that will give the Greek people a genuine hopeful perspective. We are tired of the years of toxicity, internet gangs, wishful thinking, populism, low quality of public debate. With our program, with our specific positions, with our proposals on the welfare state, on the economy, on taxation, on the revival of the agricultural sector, on competitive production, we have a duty to prove that there is a credible progressive force. And this is our great ambition, on election night, to be a strong, credible progressive force that can show the other way against maintenance, against the client state, against meritocracy, against opacity.

Friends, in the last few days we have witnessed an unthinkable political conflict between New Democracy and Syriza. They have shown through this conflict that they are profoundly reckless. In the face of their ephemeral political interests and petty party interests, they do not even consider national issues, such as the sensitive issue of Thrace and the Greek Muslims. What have we seen? On the one hand, Mrs Bakoyannis speaking in a village in Komotini as if we were in the 1950s, with extreme right-wing despotic speech towards Greek citizens. We condemn this speech. It has nothing to do with a modern European country, gentlemen of the New Democracy. On the other hand, Mr Tsipras does not make things clear. Could it be that there are members of the Greek Parliament who are questioning the Treaty of Lausanne? But the Lausanne Treaty speaks of Greek Muslims. So let us be clear, let us stop the games of New Democracy and Syriza, the cheap election games.

And we say this because we, with our patriotic character and our sense of responsibility, have demonstrated the potential for unity among the people of Thrace, both Christians and Muslims. Andreas Papandreou broke down the barriers of shame, and Costas Simitis, with George Papandreou as Foreign Minister, enacted the 5 percent law that enabled hundreds of thousands of Greek Muslims to attend universities. After 20 years, the number of scientists in Thrace has increased fivefold. This party offers perspective and is committed to respecting human rights. It is a promising party of progress that stands in opposition to the unacceptable petty party attitudes that threaten to divide Greece for the benefit of small groups engaged in everyday political action. We envision Greece as a normal European country, not one that is ready to be divided at the slightest provocation.

Friends, Mr. Tsipras must also answer why he did not pass the law on the election of the Mufti last summer. These are political questions, and let's stop with the conspiracies and innuendos. If they have something more to say, let them say it publicly to the Greek people to stop this game of dangerous impressions.

But, friends, we have a duty to clarify some things about our national issues since we have opened this issue. Our movement, with a progressive and patriotic discourse, has stood at very critical moments. We put Cyprus in the European Union. With the Helsinki policy, we defined European Union-Turkey relations. But now that Turkey has no European prospects, what do we do? The whole political system, even if Kilicdaroglu and Erdogan were to come out, is directly challenging the sovereign rights of our country. And we keep hearing about armaments. We voted realistically to strengthen our country's deterrent power. We did not play populist games like Syriza, but until when will the arms rally continue? That is why PASOK's first priority is not this rally of competition with Turkey, but to stop the West from selling even one bullet to Turkey as long as it violates sovereign rights and does not respect good neighborly relations in Greece and Cyprus. The arms embargo is a top priority for a patriotic movement. Our partners must also understand why. Greece cannot pay billions of euros from the toil and sacrifice of the Greek people to guard the Euro-Turkish border, which is, of course, also Greek-Turkish. The same is true of other countries, Finland, Estonia, and Cyprus. What should we do? We must go further and further if we want a Europe of peoples and solidarity. We must stand up and play a leading role in the policy of Europe's single foreign policy, the Euroarmy, as with Frontex. The Greek borders must have a European army so that anyone who undermines good neighborly relations knows that they are not dealing with one or two peoples but with 27 peoples of the European Union. That is the big difference between our pro-Europeanism and the caresses that some people in Brussels give. We want Europe united, but with respect for the country in solidarity, not a Europe and a West that pampers Turkey and disregards the great weaknesses that exist in the European firmament. And I say this because after the experience of Ukraine, the ears of the European peoples are open to avoid a new adventure with revisionist leaders, as happened with Putin.

Friends, we have a duty to talk about the big issue concerning the National Health System. We have seen what has happened in recent weeks with the ambulance service in Kos and New Makri. Why have we not supported the National Health System? Once upon a time, with the memoranda, too many resources were cut, and often unfairly. But today, with the Recovery Fund, with 20 billion in subsidies and 10 billion in loans, the country could have afforded to hire 700 rescuers so that in 67 places throughout the country, as I was informed by the management of the EKAB, there is only one ambulance for twenty-four hours, 3 eight-hour shifts, when hundreds of thousands of tourists are waiting in Kos and in places in mainland Greece with similar problems. It could have afforded to hire 1000 university police officers, who are nowhere to be found today, when they could have put private companies in charge of guarding the universities through a tender and recruited in the areas where the welfare state is hurting, in health and education. This is our difference in values from New Democracy. We, with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos, founded the National Health System, and they are undermining it to the greatest extent possible. And they tell you that this issue of the National Health System is timeless. That's not what the evidence says. The figures say that in recent years we've been third in private health care spending across Europe. The figures have been disputed until recently by New Democracy officials on television. The day before yesterday, new figures came out. The country's position has worsened, second only to the Bulgarians in private spending, and the Greeks in the 27 countries of the European Union pay such a high proportion of private health spending because the NHS has collapsed. So, is this social justice?

What do we say? Not 2-4% of the Recovery Fund but 8-10%. Besides, the Portuguese, Spanish, and Italians with similar problems are giving more than that to have an extensive primary health care network. This was lacking in the pandemic era, so the wave-breaker is the public hospital and not the primary care, as in the rest of Europe. Salaries at the European Union average for health workers. We cannot continue with what is happening today, with doctors studying in Greece and leaving for Germany and France where there is a shortage of doctors. There must be salary incentives. And, of course, the mockery of heavy and unhealthy work must end. Our health workers should finally be included in the heavy and unhealthy category, as they deserve and as they should be, and as some people have committed themselves to, but have been fooled as thousands of Greeks have been fooled. And I am talking about the government of the New Democracy.

What else should we do? Welfare state, education. They are undermining the foundation. Is that the only problem? The major issue with our education system is that the school is no longer the center of gravity, but rather the tutorial. What are we doing to reverse this problem and make it less expensive for parents to send their children to university? We are introducing the national baccalaureate so that a child is not evaluated in 15 days, but in the last 2 years of high school, allowing for dignity and lower costs to attend the school of their choice, not just the one their family can afford. Our priority is public education as a driving force for social upward mobility of the Greek people, as it was in the 80s and 90s. This is the education we envision and when people ask about Article 16, obviously if there are some businessmen who want to invest in a private university, we will not stand in the way, but that is not our priority. Our priority is that the child of the weaker family and the middle class should be able, through public education at all levels, to succeed in life and make their dreams come true. This is our vision of a strong welfare state and not to hand over the welfare state to private individuals and speculators. However, public schooling has another aspect. In many parts of Greece, I meet parents, and I say this because it is the most tragic thing about this election campaign and my own personal experience, who have children on the autism spectrum. People in their 40s and 45s who tell me that their fear is what their children will do when they are gone. Imagine and put yourself in the shoes of a new 40 and 45 year old parent thinking about the end of life for their child. This is not a normal European state and we, PASOK, have prioritized special education structures to finally create the school of inclusion and not just give some allowances that do not go anywhere for these families. And, of course, remedial teaching to reduce learning inequalities in schools.

Friends, PASOK is well aware of the mistakes it has made in the past. It is not an unrepentant party. That is why I committed myself from the very first moment of my election to bring a new political ethos to the country and to build a new relationship of trust, especially with the younger generations who abhor parties as vulgar clientelistic mechanisms. This is why I said, and I believe that we should all do this in our country, that universal meritocracy in the selection of hospital and organization governors was tragically demonstrated in the unbelievable event, in the unbelievable tragedy of Tempe, where party members of New Democracy with no knowledge of trains, no knowledge of the OSE, held critical positions, but this happens throughout the public sector. So what are we saying? Every government, as soon as it is formed, for 2 months to hold an open international competition, to submit the CVs of Greeks from inside and outside the country, to be selected by an independent organization, by an independent group of scientists, and with a five-year term of office to serve you and not the respective Mansion of Maximou, as a hard clientele mechanism, a personal mechanism of a state prey of the respective Prime Minister. And of course, transparency everywhere.

What is Mr. Mitsotakis' transparency? The 3700 temporary employees or the 10 billion in direct assignments?

Transparency everywhere, competitions so that every Greek knows where every last euro of their tax goes. This means for us a new era of reconstruction of the Greek state, without continuing the pathologies that led us to the memoranda. Because if we do not put an end to it now, you can be sure that we will be led back into a fiscal adventure.

And I say this because the economic data is revealing. Of course, the economists, the experts, those who know things well, are hiding. We don't see them on TV anymore. Where are they to talk about the national debt? Where are they to talk about the external deficit? Where are they to talk about the trade deficit? About the structure of the tax system? Mitsotakis has loaded 50 billion in new debt on your backs, your children's, and future generations in 4 years. The external deficit is the largest since 2010. And when they say that this is happening all over Europe, they are lying. It is not happening all over Europe. Portugal, with similar issues as Greece, had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year. Greece had a 12% deficit last year and a 9% deficit this year. Why is this debate not taking place? And some people ask us where we are going to get the money to support education. Where will we find the money to support health? And we say to them, let Mr Mitsotakis first tell us what he has done with the 50 billion in debt that he has put on the backs of the Greek people. Because I have never seen anywhere in the world where the opposition wants the opposition to apologize instead of the New Democracy government.

Friends, we have a duty to speak up about everything - taxation, the economy, and competitiveness. We're being lied to when we're told that proposing a tax on the wealthy is a "tax storm." What we're proposing only affects 0.02% of the Greek population. How many of you can pass on up to 4.8 million euros tax-free to your children? Who does this policy really benefit? In a bankrupt Greece with hundreds of thousands of Greek children leaving the country, is it right that oligarchs can transfer up to 4.8 million euros tax-free? This only benefits 1000 families. We propose a cap of €800,000 per child or for both parents. This applies to everyone, including the middle class and those with higher incomes, except for the oligarchs. Is this really a "tax storm"? When we're asked what we'll do with this money, our first priority is demographics - our villages and towns. Our population is aging, and we need to do something about it. We should follow the example of other European countries. In Greece, families without children and families with two children only have a 3-point difference in tax rates. The European average is 10 points. Why is this? Because Europe as a whole is facing a demographic crisis and can no longer afford to give tax breaks for not just 3 or 4 children, but even 2 children. Why can't we do the same? We're committed to tax fairness and supporting families, which means at least an 8-10 point reduction in taxes for families with 2 children. This is how we support families in our country, just like other states such as Portugal (10-11 points), the Czech Republic (14 points), and Ireland (15 points) support their demographics.

Black labor. What are we saying? SYRIZA tore the Greek people apart with social security contributions, but why look back?

Go ahead. Reduce social security contributions. Only then will young people learn that they can work without moonlighting. This is how our funds will be able to stand and how we will also get decent wages with lower social security contributions. These policies are not policies for the few. They are not a tax storm, they are social justice. It is just that those who are hitting PASOK and these proposals are the ones who will pay, the thousands of families that Mr Mitsotakis faithfully serves. We serve the country, we serve the Greek people, and we have other priorities. And of course, VAT on basic goods. We heard that too, populism. But is it populism to reduce VAT on a few basic goods so that the most vulnerable Greeks can buy their milk, their bread, and is it not populism that New Democracy in its 2019 program talks about reduced VAT in both categories?

Then they could, now they can't? But what's going on? They tell you that we reduced the rates and the people gained 7 billion in 4 years. It's true. Of course, the rates were lowered more for the rich and less for the poor. What is our response? That in 2 years they got 5 billion more VAT and excise tax from the weakest and middle class.

That is why we are discussing a different policy mix. These are not hypothetical scenarios or nonexistent concepts. If we examine the tax structure, our proposal aligns with what is occurring in all European countries: the establishment of a robust welfare state that promotes growth, production, and dignity. Our objective is equity. We strive for every citizen to sense that the state is supporting them and treating every individual and family with respect.

Friends, beyond taxation, health, and education, there are other significant issues that concern pensioners. We are not being catered to. We propose three measures, costing one billion 130 million. Firstly, the introduction of a new ESAS to replace the one abolished by Mr Tsipras, benefiting 350,000 low pensioners. Secondly, the abolition of the personal differential from 1/1/24 for four years, with a fiscal impact. In the fourth year, there is no cost to the budget, and the unfair provisions for disability and widow's pensions no longer exist, allowing those in need to receive the pensions they are entitled to. Civil servants need to catch up with inflation, which costs a billion 200 million. All these interventions, totaling 2.3 billion, are reasonable. We are not discussing the thirteenth pension, which costs 2.7 billion, as we do not want any citizen to feel that PASOK in this new era has made promises it cannot keep to win their vote. We speak with dignity and logic so that every citizen knows that PASOK wants to support them as best it can, but always in a fiscally secure way.

Another huge issue that concerns both Crete and the rest of Greece is private debt. In the past, some people have said, "Don't pay, we will bring Sesakhtia." These were the golden sponsors of New Democracy who went to villages and towns and said, "Don't pay your loans, we will find arrangements." In 2015, as soon as they became the government, they sold billions of red loans with a law of SYRIZA-Independent Greeks to the funds' crows. As a result, cooperatives, individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, and businesses are in a dire situation, blackmailed by these profit-making institutions.

There must be universal protection of the main house for the vulnerable and the middle class. This is what PASOK did in 2010 to defend our weakest fellow citizens. Secondly, we must pass a law that sets criteria for negotiating with funds. These criteria should lead to regulation, and not leave the market unregulated. If we don't regulate the market, funds will drive thousands of businesses and cooperatives to extinction. We also believe that the banks' profit margin for consistent borrowers should be reduced. This will give all those who have not endured an incentive to have a second chance at dignity. It will also give those who have endured an incentive to continue to pay their loans. Finally, there are the 120 payments. If you go to the city of Rethymno tomorrow morning and ask small and medium-sized businesses, "Did you join the 120 instalments made by New Democracy?" You can be sure that they are counted on the fingers of one hand. This is simply not an arrangement for many, but for very few. We are committing ourselves to 120 instalments for everyone, for the tax authorities and the National Social Security Fund. This will regulate the market and provide liquidity for businesses. Our aim is to keep the small and medium-sized enterprise standing, with a perspective, and to keep it on its feet.

Friends, regarding the demographic, I mentioned our tax policies earlier, but that is not all. We have a duty to support the family and the Greek mother. With a strong PASOK, I pledge that no child or family will be left out of nurseries and creative employment centers. This is how we support the Greek family in practice. Additionally, the amendment we proposed before the elections will be reintroduced after these elections to increase maternity allowance for freelance women.

And of course, there is the social housing program. Mr. Mitsotakis tried to imitate our proposal. But do you know what it reveals? That he disregards the great problems of the younger generation. When other states included tens of thousands of houses in the Recovery Fund, he included only 100 houses in the Recovery Fund, 70 in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. And when PASOK started talking about this issue, he said, "I will make a program." What is his program? He gives low-interest loans for young people to buy houses. If you ask, many have been approved to get loans, but the price of mobile phones today is higher than the loan amount, so this is again for the few, the haves.

What are we saying? We are putting closed and new homes into a social pool with a target of 150,000 homes in 4 years, using a Recovery Fund, tax incentives, and reconstruction incentives. These homes will be used to house young couples and vulnerable Greeks with low rent. When these individuals are able to stand on their own feet, other families can move in. This is social justice and support for Greeks, rather than creating customers through low interest loans. This approach is being implemented in all European countries. Mr. Mitsotakis' approach has already failed.

Friends, I cannot avoid mentioning the agricultural issues here in Rethymno. We are the party that has supported the peasantry since the 1980s, giving them dignity and prospects. Because blood is thicker than water, PASOK is here again to embrace the rural world of the country, providing incentives for competitiveness, production, and prospects so that our villages and the Greek countryside can thrive. The rural income lost in recent years amounts to 1.3 billion. 70% of our farmers have significant debts to public funds, EFKA, and banks. What are we proposing? We will reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs, with zero excise duty on agricultural oil during the crisis. We will implement two measures for agricultural supplies and oil.

Secondly, priority is given to renewable energy parks for farmers, cooperatives, municipalities, and energy communities all over Greece, not just for the powerful at the expense of the democratization of electricity production. We say this because how can we have stable production costs if all this new development, new industry, and new electricity production is given only to the powerful? This only happens here. In all European countries, whether with small energy communities of producers, processors, and cooperatives, or with municipal energy communities, or with photovoltaics on roofs, they shield the vulnerable from energy poverty and the producer from rising production costs.

We have a different plan than that of New Democracy, a plan that serves the many, the producers, and not the oligarchs of the country. Mr. Mitsotakis constantly caresses the issue of energy. Look at what we heard when we talked about taxing the excess profits of power generators, suppliers, and banks. Shouldn't their excess profits be taxed? They received billions of euros in subsidies, and then we saw it in the PPC tariff, which we paid. Shouldn't they pay something too? What I want to say is, when the income of the Greek people fell in 2022, and real wages fell by 7%, how did they manage to triple their profits in the midst of an energy crisis? So, it is fair to tax their excess profits, and anyone who speculates at the expense of the country, the middle class, and the Greek people should know that the state is here to regulate the market and not to have a market that is a jungle for the few at the expense of the many. On this issue too, social democracy has solutions. It sets rules and regulates the market. It does not allow powerful interests to speculate at the expense of the people.

Friends, finally, on the subject of the agricultural sector. In the last few days, during the week before last, I was here in Rethymnon. I visited the agricultural cooperative with its famous cheeses. Prior to that, I had been to Chios, to the Mastic Research Centre with its highly specialised products. I also visited the Toplou monastery with its standardised wines and oil. Lastly, I went to the Honey Museum in Rhodes. I want to send a message with this experience. This message is for tourism entrepreneurs, but also for the country in general. Tourism does not mean celebrating when 25 million or 30 million travellers come to Greece. Tourism means setting measurable targets so that everyone wins - farmers, ranchers, processors, and workers. This is value-added tourism. This is not an invention of PASOK. Italy has been doing this for years, Spain has been doing this for years, and Portugal has been doing this since the economic crisis. When you visit their homelands, you taste their domestic products, become their ambassador, and then look for these products on the shelves of supermarkets all over Europe and the world. This is our vision for value-added tourism that joins forces with manufacturing and the primary sector. We can create new jobs all over Greece so that Greek children can stay here with good wages. We can have exports, a productive economy, and a strong society.

Friends, friends, I truly believe that the party on May 21st took a significant first step, especially since our political opponents, both of whom are now revealing their plan, wanted a small PASOK, a PASOK instrumentalized in their plans. They failed, and they failed because the sovereign people spoke. I call on these people to embrace the democratic progressive plan of justice for our country and to give us a new strong voice on June 25th. This party has never played to the extremes; that is why they call it the Democratic Party. It has never coddled Golden Dawn to get votes, nor has it struck at independent authorities or undermined justice and human rights. That is what you will find in Syriza and New Democracy. I hear Mr Mitsotakis saying, "If I have 149, what am I going to do? Should I hold elections in August?" So what is Mitsotakis saying? "Vote for me so that I do not spoil your holidays." Last month he was saying, "Vote for me because Mr Androulakis did not come to meet me." These are childish arguments. If the current electoral law had been in the previous result, New Democracy would have 172 seats, and let the mainstream media stop scaring the Greek people. Things are too simple. The danger is no longer instability, but the omnipotence of New Democracy, and I call for a strong mandate to be a strong opposition, a bulwark against the arrogance and the client state of Mr Mitsotakis' system of power. But even if the Greek people ultimately gave him 149 seats, Mr Mitsotakis has solutions. Mr Voridis in a top ministry. Mr Georgiades in a top ministry. Mr Plevris in a top ministry. Their daddy, Mr Karatzaferis, closely supports the supposedly liberal Mr Mitsotakis. Mr Kranidiotis is also close by. He closed down his far-right party, and he too supports the supposedly liberal Mr Mitsotakis. So, Mr Mitsotakis, do you have all these people in your party? Will Velopoulos or Niki spoil you? So you have choices in the far-right center because this is not a liberal center; this is for power. There are no principles, there are no values.

Here, we move forward with dignity, progress, and the support of the Greek people, based on principles and values. I urge all progressive democrats to join our efforts to make our island green again and strengthen our party, contributing to a strong democratic movement throughout Greece.

But for Mr Tsipras, who says it is the fault of PASOK, KKE, and the simple proportional representation won by New Democracy, everyone is to blame but him. Let's give up. Did we have a simple proportional representation in 2019? But 19 lost in national and European elections, and if it wasn't for a top local government official, Stavros Arnaoutakis, the whole of Greece would have been blue in 2019. So which PASOK is to blame and which KKE? The golden sponsor was populism and the disastrous governance of '15-'19 by Mr. Tsipras. Finally, take responsibility and let this party chart the new course and become the real opponent of New Democracy again so that there can be a strong and credible opposition, not the populists who learned with the toxic gangs and the word of division. But do you know? Every politician in his political life has turning points. The turning point for Mr. Tsipras was a few days before the national elections on May 25 when he revealed why he did not vote for the amendment to prevent the neo-Nazi killers of Pavlos Fyssas from taking part in the elections. He revealed it by saying that the misguided voters of the prisoner who allowed New Democracy to take a vacation from prison should vote for Syriza.

This party is not begging the far right. It is the democratic party with its principles and its history, and we are the ones who, throughout the years of the post-independence period, have stood against the extremes and maintained our position. We are the party of social justice and national dignity. We are the PASOK that was founded to serve the people and the homeland, and I call on you to take this PASOK in your hands and fight together in the next 14 days. If we fight together, you can be sure that on the evening of June 25th, the sun of PASOK will rise again as the sun of justice and perspective. The sun of hope will once again shine over the country. There are 14 days left, let us fight united to be the great victors. June 25th is a milestone day, together we will win. Bless you and thank you from the bottom of my heart. Friends, in closing, I want you to know that this relationship that began with each and every one of you individually is an unbreakable political relationship that no one will be able to undermine. It is a relationship of trust. We are not going to disappoint any Greek woman or Greek man who will support us on June 25th. We will stand by the citizen inside and outside the Greek parliament and we will fight for their real concerns. This is the people's movement of PASOK, and this is the movement I want the young people of our country to embrace again. So please give it a fight. With struggle, we will be the great winners. With a fight, we will achieve what two years ago seemed impossible, the great victory for the rebirth of the democratic party. Be well. I thank you here in Rethymno from the depths of my heart. The message today is also a message of victory, from all corners of the country. Be well. Crete, the castle of PASOK, the Crete that loved Andreas Papandreou, is once again at the forefront of the struggle for renaissance. Be well and good strength.

And a song for our great creator, Yannis Markopoulos, who passed away yesterday. Dedicated to Yannis, the post-independence great Greek, a great Cretan who inspired many, many generations of Greeks with his work, a work that embraced the democratic struggles, our roots. We wish him a good journey. To his family, we extend our warmest condolences, and we close this gathering with a favorite song of the great creator.

Be well, and on June 25th, Rethymno will have a representative, and PASOK will be strong. Bless you.
