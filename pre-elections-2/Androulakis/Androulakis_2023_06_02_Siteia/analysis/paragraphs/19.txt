I said today at Toplou that PASOK's priority is a different development model, the development model. It mainly concerns the sectors of the economy where the country is already strong, such as tourism, the primary sector, and manufacturing. These sectors need to be put into synergy. We cannot say that 25 million tourists are coming to Greece, but very few of them taste the Greek domestic processed products. If they do not taste them in Greece, they will seek them in foreign markets. This is the challenge of tourism, and it is what the Italians have been doing for decades. That was Spain, and that's what the Portuguese are doing. They are interconnecting these three sectors so that the profit is not only in the hotel or catering sector but in the entire Greek economy. This is a growth model that creates good jobs with extroversion, resulting in strong exports for an economy that keeps its children here and does not send them abroad by the thousands.
