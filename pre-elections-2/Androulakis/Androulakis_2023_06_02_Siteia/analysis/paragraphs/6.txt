What is he trying to avoid? We were told that we got out of the memoranda, that the Greek economy will be stabilized, that inequalities will be reduced, that children will have good jobs. What do the official figures say? 50 billion of new debt accumulated by Mr Mitsotakis on the backs of our own and future generations will make a competitive economy. What do the figures say? 12% - we had a deficit in 2022, 9% - we will have a trade deficit in 2023. They say it's Corona's fault, but Corona was the fault of all of Europe. Let's see the figures - Portugal had a 1% deficit last year plus a surplus this year. Spain and Italy have about the same figures, only Greece is again in the crosshairs of a new adventure. Taxes - 2/3 of the taxes the state collects are indirect taxes, the most unfair taxes.
