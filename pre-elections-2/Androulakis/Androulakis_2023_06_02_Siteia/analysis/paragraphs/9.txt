And you know, we have experienced similar situations before in our country. The people voted for Kostas Karamanlis in 2007 and in 2009 Greece faced a 15% domestic deficit. A year later, Greece went into memorandum. That's what we want - not to criticize the government's power or fiscal performance, or how it handled the Recovery Fund. PASOK is here to provide perspective, to criticize and to call a spade a spade. For example, in order for an individual to receive a dividend of EUR 150,000, they must own one and a half million euros worth of shares in OTE. Looking at these figures, we can assess who is truly talking about the middle class. We will take from the few and powerful what every European country gets, because the figures we are giving are average for European countries. We are not talking about extreme scenarios of a tax storm. We will give where there is a need, such as in wage labor, where there is a huge need to lower the tax on wage labor through lower contributions, to have less black work, more money in our coffers, and better wages for our children. We like to put the money into demographics because the data is inexorable. Greece has the worst negative coefficient between a family that has 2 children and a family that has no children. There is a 3-point difference in the coefficient in favor of a family with 2 children in Greece, 10 in Portugal, 14 in the Czech Republic, 15 in Ireland, and so on in most European countries because all European countries have a serious demographic issue and are taking measures. We will properly tax the oligarchs and support the real problems of society. We will support families with 2 children by making the tax differential reach 8-10 points in the first instance so that there is support for the huge national demographic need for us. It is the number one priority.
