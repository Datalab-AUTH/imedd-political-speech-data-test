So what do we say? An 8-10% Recovery Fund is needed to rebuild the National Health System. This means strong primary health care, care throughout the country with centers. We saw the lack of them and the damage they caused during the pandemic era. All the burden fell on public hospitals because of the lack of primary health care. This means dignified salaries for health workers, their inclusion in the heavy and unhealthy work, and of course, a real health map that takes into account geography, population, and aging to truly build our health system. We cannot ignore one of the biggest problems of our time, which is the collapse of public health and education.
