I say this because the real libertarian is not only Tsipras, who has been proven and judged by the Greek people both as a government and as an opposition, but also Mitsotakis, who has a moment with Mr. Tsipras and the support of powerful interests. That is why we have a choice of dignity, hope, and perspective on June 25. Strong Pasok means a strong opposition. The simplicity of the system of New Democracy means that Mr. Mitsotakis in the Parliament will rediscover his real opponent, the opponent of progress and his opponents. Credibility would have been spoiled with the opposition of SYRIZA. Now things will enter a new path, so I ask the Greek people to give a real alternative after 4 years in opposition. An opposition that the Greek people lost 4 whole years is unthinkable. It will be unthinkable to have Patsies who buy the loans of the people, widespread corruption, not paying for every tragedy of the temps, selling billions of red loans to funds to blackmail citizens, businesses, and cooperatives, and having scandals in matters of institutions and democracy, such as wiretapping. Instead of New Democracy falling, your golden guide, Mr. Mitsotakis, is no longer here. Here is the Pasok democratic party, so I ask for the power of choice on June 25. Pasok is here, united and strong, and has proven itself with its large percentages in our heart, in our castle, and in the prefecture of Lassithi. We aspire to make our island green again, the island that you love, Pasok, and our founder Andreas Papandreou.
