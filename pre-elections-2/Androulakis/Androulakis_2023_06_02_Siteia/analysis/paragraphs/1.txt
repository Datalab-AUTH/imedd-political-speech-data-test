Even though the weather did not favor us, we continue our march for June 25th. It is a milestone date for PASOK to return even more dynamically to the political scene. I am sure that with the struggle of each and every one of us individually throughout Greece and here in Crete, we will bring the sun back up and make our island green again, just as the castle of PASOK, the castle of the democratic party, was historically green politically.
