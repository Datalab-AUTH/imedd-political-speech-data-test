But what are we facing in the last few days? Suddenly, they are reading our program until the next elections and all they are asking us is who we are going to go with. Finally, the Greek people answered them with contempt, stating that first the people decide and then there are discussions about governments, convergences, and program dialogues. Now they have discovered the program, but they display what they want and how they want it. Why? Because quite simply, Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy are faithful to the doctrine that is all for power without principles or values. They have created a system of communicative absolute storm and communicative totalitarianism. I cannot explain otherwise how it is possible to consider overtaxing €1000, not on the profits of the company, but on personal dividends of €70,000. What we are saying is that it is €1000 more, and it is not overtaxation. It is a blow to the middle class and the weak Greeks that he has collected €5 billion more in VAT than he had budgeted in two years. That is the blow. That is overtaxation. That is the undermining of common sense.
