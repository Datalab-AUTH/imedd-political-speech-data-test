Fifth point? I cannot discuss agriculture here. From Lassithi, the major issue is the rising production costs. You know very well that PASOK has supported the agricultural sector more than any other party in the past since the 1980s. In recent years, the figures are alarming. The rural population has decreased by 260 thousand people in the last decade. The cultivated areas have decreased by six and a half million acres, and agricultural income has decreased by 1.3 billion. 70% of our farmers are in debt to public funds, EFKA, and banks. Tens of thousands of farmers and 727 cooperatives have transferred red loans from the era of the rural bank. Many of them have been taken by the funds, and they are being directly blackmailed. The threat of foreclosure is stronger than ever. What does this threat mean? This threat means the deflation of the Greek economy. As a patriotic progressive movement, we propose that all parties vote for a framework of negotiations and rules in the forefront for the funds between them and the borrowers whose priority is to regulate and not to eliminate. Funds are not interested in regulation; they have a job to do. They go from one country to another, take advantage of financial weaknesses, fiscal problems, rehearsals of the banking system to buy cheap, sell a little more, speculate, and go to another victim. We have to set rules. No Greek should feel alone in the face of the blackmail of the funds brought to Greece by Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis.
