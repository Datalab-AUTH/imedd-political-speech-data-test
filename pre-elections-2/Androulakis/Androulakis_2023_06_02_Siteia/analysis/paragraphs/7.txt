Labour rights are well known. What is the situation in the labor market? And what about the big problems concerning competitiveness and funding from the European Recovery Fund? What did producers gain? What did small businesses and infrastructure gain? All states received this fund and supported small and medium-sized enterprises. They created financial institutions for states like Portugal that have similar problems supporting businesses that cannot borrow from banks. What did New Democracy do? It gave billions to banks to lend at lower interest rates, but who did that money go to? Was it for those in need who have a liquidity noose around their necks or for those who already had financial ability and now have it cheap? Europe did not provide the money for them.
