It is not a blow to the middle class, farmers, or producers. The increase in production costs will be discussed, but not what has already occurred. The Greek people are unaware that in the last four years, values, cost of living, and everyday life have become more difficult. This is not only our opinion, but also that of the OECD, who states that real wages have fallen by 7.4%. Mr. Skertsos agrees with this statement. Mr. Mitsotakis, the OECD figures announced today are exactly the same as those announced by the European Commission. The European Commission is lying.
