Welfare state. What do we want in the welfare state? I visited Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki. Three and a half thousand operating rooms are on the list of shame, with long waits and desperate people in agony. But that is what the pandemic recovery fund is for - to support our hospitals. The figures are relentless: 8-11% donated by Portugal and other countries with similar problems like Greece, while only 2% is real and 4% is for the Mitsotakis government if we add up the energy upgrade with the hospital building. This is no disrespect to a people who pay the third-highest private expenditure in Europe. Watch now to see how it's all explained by the European Union figures. Greece and Lithuania have the lowest dividend tax rate, but we are similar elsewhere. We have the most private healthcare spending, which means that Lithuanians and Greeks pay billions out of their own pockets for healthcare that other European countries don't pay because they have fair taxation and a strong welfare state. So this is our huge difference from the New Democracy.
