We have to call a spade a spade. We have reached the point of no return. PASOK has suffered, according to SYRIZA. What PASOK says is what SYRIZA says. What does our program, which targets taxation, dividends, issues related to supporting families, issues related to the green transition, and issues related to production, have to do with SYRIZA's program? Or the issues concerning pensioners? Mr. Mitsotakis made a fuss before the elections. He was talking about instability, asking people to vote for him, but Tsipras won the election by 20 points. We know very well that he is one of the governments of the post-revolution that have brought nothing but problems to the Greek people. Now who is the one causing instability? PASOK's program, he says, is the same as Syriza's. I really want to say to every Greek here in Greece that the only party that resembles the practices of Mr. Polakis' SYRIZA is New Democracy. This party speaks specifically, which is why I asked for our programs to be taken to the budget office of the Parliament to be costed so that every Greek can understand what we want to do and what New Democracy has already done. Mr. Mitsotakis is trying to avoid this by throwing the ball into the stands.
