The third question I want to show is: Is private debt a huge issue? Billions are owed by Greek citizens. Mr. Tsipras was saying sorry, don't pay, I'll solve the problems, but he didn't solve anything. Not only did he not solve billions of red loans, he passed his own law in 2015 and he can ward to take pictures of Mrs Katseli. He trimmed the 2010 PASOK law that protected the first home and the gentleman is at least finished. And there is no such protection and that protection is in Lesvos. We will restore the protection of the first home with specific criteria, objective criteria. We will give a solution to the families who have taken loans with Swiss francs. 80,000 families so that the borrower pays 1/3 of the loan of the interest rate increase, the borrower and 2/3 to charge the banking institution. And of course, we will reduce the profit margin of the banks for consistent borrowers so that there are incentives for everyone. We want every citizen to feel that the state is guarding the effort, that there is a dignity option for everyone, that the green does not burn with the dry. This is a society that protects the effort made by the citizen, citizens and finally the 120 installments. The New Democracy has introduced the 120 installments, but not for you and the few. Therefore, we propose universal 120 installments for both tax and social security funds. If at the end there is full payment, and if the regulated person is punctual, there is a reduction of 30%. I hear the New Republic saying they will lose revenue. With these adjustments, we will just get more revenue over a longer term because if you make adjustments, you enable a lot of people to do planning and pay what they owe the state. If you don't make adjustments, people will simply not pay, and they will be looking at their debts. We're going to see a vicious cycle of undermining the economic stability of the country.
