Friends, only 3 weeks remain until the largely decisive political scene of the coming years. If we fight every day and make our realistic, progressive, and fair ideas a reality in every caf√©, village, and town, PASOK will be a strong winner in the June 25 elections. 220,000 more people trusted us on the last Sunday of the elections, and I hope even more will join us to bring back democracy, respect, human rights, and fair development that prioritize the people and their aspirations. We must be strong to protect the Greek people and put a stop to the arrogance and authoritarianism of the New Democracy government. Friends, I ask you to take the effort into our own hands during these 3 weeks. If everyone fights on June 25, a new path will open up. We will have a new parliamentary group, renewal, unity, and political autonomy. We may say things that annoy the few and the services that Mitsotakis offers them, but they unite us because we are the party of social justice and national dignity. PASOK was founded to serve the people and the homeland, and we are sending a strong message of political change on June 25 from one end of the country to the other. The castle of PASOK and the prefecture of Lasithi and our Crete will again send a message of victory on June 25 to all the Greek people. Thank you for your presence, even though the weather has made us a little uncomfortable. Be well and have a good race.
