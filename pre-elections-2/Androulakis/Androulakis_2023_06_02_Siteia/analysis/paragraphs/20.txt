Friends, in closing, this is the party of regional development. This is the party that created local government and gave it the tools to be close to the citizen. Of course, we have to do even more. We disagree with the so-called executive state and Mitsotakis not only because he was eavesdropping and involved in huge corruption scandals, but also because we believe there should be a diffusion of powers as a model for the country's administration. An executive state must strengthen democracy and regional development. This means that the pillar of democracy called local government must be a protagonist and not serve central power. It is a bet for PASOK. We will rebuild a local government that will have all the possibilities, all the services, and all the obstacles that other European states have. So if this local government exists, Seteia does not have to beg to get here just to do the main roads, long-diamond or dice-marking, flood protection works, and of course, the modernisation of the airport. A strong local government that has resources has possibilities that the state is talking to it about how to use the Recovery Fund, and not from the top decides and the local government just implements and if it implements. What we are saying is dialogue, dialogue, and joint strategy of local communities through local government with the central state. This is happening all over Europe, and this is how we are addressing local problems. But we are also addressing two other issues that were there. They exist, and Mr Mitsotakis is also a protagonist: opacity and undeclared work. We are here in this new era to fight these phenomena that have disappointed the Greek people to an absolute degree.
