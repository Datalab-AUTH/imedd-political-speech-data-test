On pensions, what do we say? We don't support them all like Mr. Tsipras. We are saying very specific things because we know the country's fiscal situation. We are starting a new EKAS for 350,000 low pensioners who are in a difficult situation. This is a measure that SYRIZA abolished. The second measure is the abolition of the personal difference from the first 24. This measure has a fiscal footprint of 4 years, after which it is essentially zeroed out as a fiscal measure. It makes no difference to the budget. The third measure is correcting the great injustices in widow's pensions and disability pensions. These three measures cost a billion 130 million. We support public sector wages with one billion 200 million to bring them up to the level of inflation. We don't make populist promises that we can automatically increase private sector wages by 25 to 100 in four years. No government can commit to that. You can't commit to what the private sector will do and why. I'm being bullshitted for a grand as an anti-growth incentive to dividends. But they don't say whether the private sector, which is in its current state, can take a quick 25% pay raise.
