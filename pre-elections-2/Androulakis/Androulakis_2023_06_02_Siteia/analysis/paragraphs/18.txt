Production costs have increased by 22.4% in just one year. What measures can we take to reduce production costs for agricultural inputs? We propose implementing zero excise duty on agricultural oil during the crisis period and supporting prioritized energy communities. This will provide stable energy costs for farmers, livestock farmers, and processors for the next 15 years through renewable energy sources. Additionally, we suggest introducing unconditional and tax-free subsidies, compensation, and aid to farmers. We recommend updating the ELGA insurance regulation to extend coverage of disasters to livestock and crops caused by climate change. The Ministry seems to ignore the significant impact of climate change on farmers. As we expect to experience one of the hottest summers in many years, ELGA must adapt to these new conditions. We believe that the entire process of the Common Agricultural Policy programs should be completed within one year to avoid bureaucracy and problems for our farmers.
