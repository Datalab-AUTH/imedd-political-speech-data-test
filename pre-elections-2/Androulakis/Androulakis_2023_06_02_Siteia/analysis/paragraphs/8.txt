I am saying all of this because we need to put things into perspective. I do not expect anything more from their media, which has been coddling Mr. Mitsotakis for four years now, and is doing so provocatively before the elections. He works for them when he says he thinks it is unfair that someone making over â‚¬100,000 pays a staggered 15% on the dividends, and not on the profits of individual dividends. Obviously, he is not talking about us, the middle class, nor is he talking about the weak Greeks. When he says he wants a tax-free parental allowance to reach 4.8 million, I don't know many in the middle class whose grandparents and parents can pass on 4.8 to 4.8 million to their children. So, if there is agony for the New Democracy, it is for a thousand families in Greece. The anguish of PASOK is for millions of Greeks who want better days of social justice, dignity, hope, and real prospects. This is PASOK's agony, not the agony of chairs, nor the undermining and disregard of common sense by fake news bombardment; these are trumped-up practices.
