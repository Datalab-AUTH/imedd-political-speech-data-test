You know? But it's not just the economy. It's also democracy, dignity, and respect for ideas. The President of New Democracy had the audacity to say that he represents the progressive party and that New Democracy is the great, progressive party. Which progressive party? With Voridis and Georgiades, with Plevris, with Karatzaferis, or the day before yesterday when he announced his support for Mr. Mitsotakis and Faelos Kranidiotis. This is not center-left, this is not center, this is not center-right, this is far-right. Mr. Mitsotakis, the far-right is represented by the openings you have made in recent years.
