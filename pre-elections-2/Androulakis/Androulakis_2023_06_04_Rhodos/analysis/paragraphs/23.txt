Friends, I have heard about SYRIZA. They claim that in the past, the sea had no borders, but today they have discovered that the Aegean has boundaries. They have even tried to abuse the name of our founder. I want to make it clear from Rhodes that Andreas Papandreou and the Aegean's boundaries or the idea that the sea has no borders do not go together. This patriotic movement has always found a way to resolve issues for the benefit of our homeland, without resorting to vices that the West wants to hear at the expense of our country. What I want to say is very simple: we put Cyprus in the European Union. We played a leading role in the island's existence, and we must respond to Turkish provocation. There is no European perspective for Turkey, but there can be a trade relationship between Europe and Turkey. A Euro-Turkish agreement defending our sovereign rights can be built on the basis of this trade agreement, upgrading the Customs Union of 95. When Turkey does not respect human rights at home or international law against Cyprus, Greece, and other countries, there should be automated economic sanctions that are part of a new customs upgrade agreement. For us, this is a modern Helsinki that guards Greece-Turkey relations with respect for international law. This is what I am ready to serve, not theories that directly undermine our sovereign rights.
