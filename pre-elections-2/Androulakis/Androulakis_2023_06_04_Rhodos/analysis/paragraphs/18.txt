That's why I didn't go to Chios by chance the day before yesterday. I went to the iconic mastic research center that creates specialized products. Neither was I at the Toplou monastery in Sitia yesterday or the day before yesterday, which has fantastic oil and standardized wine that traveling tourists taste in Sitia. Nor was I accidentally found in Rethymno yesterday, at the association of agricultural cooperatives, with its well-known cheeses, or today at the honey museum. Because all these businesses must be a priority, while the modern plan is for a competitive Greece, a Greece with thousands of good jobs, and not a Greece that sees its children migrate like birds and does nothing but play the role of a policeman to powerful economic interests. We want strong tourism that is in synergy with manufacturing for the primary sector so that Greek children stay here to produce wealth and have a modern competitive economy with strong exports. This is the difference between the strategic plan and what is happening today, which leads nowhere but to a huge burden on the natural environment that in a few years will make the Greek a stranger in their homeland. We see this phenomenon of the grafting of the Greek economy that is being delivered. We will not allow it to fall into the hands of a few powerful foreigners because we are the movement of Andreas Papandreou, the patriotic movement that wants another Greek economy, an economy that strengthens the middle class and Greek children in the long term.
