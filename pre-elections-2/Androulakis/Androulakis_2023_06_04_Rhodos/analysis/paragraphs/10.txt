This is the great child of PASOK, founded by George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos, and we have a duty to revive it and stop the decline that is consciously driving it. The New Democracy serves powerful economic interests, and when the elements of the European Union are also inexorable, the Greek people pay the third-highest private health expenditure in the whole of Europe, surpassed only by Lithuania and Bulgaria. To see the figures is inexorable. The countries with the lowest tax rates on dividends over 100,000 are us and Lithuania. So it is no coincidence that in these countries that do not tax the very powerful, the welfare state is declining. We want a Western European welfare state, not a Balkan-style one. Mr Mitsotakis is at the expense of the poorest Greeks for the benefit of powerful economic interests. So what are we saying? They could have said once that they had no money. But to revive the NHS, Europe created the Recovery Fund with health as a priority. The Recovery Fund is born after the pandemic. What are we saying? Don't give 2-4% of the Recovery Fund. 2% is the actual percentage of the 20 billion. 4% goes after energy upgrading of buildings, but for services, it is 2%, when the Portuguese, Italians, and Spanish give 8-11%. Why? Because the problems we have with the ageing population, with the economic crisis that has reduced health spending, all these countries have them, so they have found a golden opportunity in the Recovery Fund to regenerate their public health.
