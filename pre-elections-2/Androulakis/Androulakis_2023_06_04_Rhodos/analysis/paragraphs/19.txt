Friends, we have a duty to support our infrastructure, including our ports, airports, and road network. We also need a special spatial framework for the creation of new plants. What is required is what I mentioned earlier: linking tourism with multiple forms of production in our country. There are many topics I could touch on, but I believe it is crucial to discuss digital convergence. Travellers can find various products in Greece, not just the ones available in previous years. Therefore, we must modernize our extroversion and commercialization methods, especially in the primary sector.
