So, what do we say about at least 8-10% of the regeneration of the NHS with strong primary healthcare? We need to immediately staff the NHS with permanent medical staff and increase the salaries of doctors and all NHS staff. They should also be included in the heavy and unhealthy payroll. Many have talked about this, but in the end, they only received applause. We will do it because we believe it is fair. All these people deserve better salaries and to be included in the heavy and unhealthy payroll. My friends here in the Dodecanese know better than I do the need to strengthen all healthcare structures. We need medical nursing staff with modern equipment on the islands and upgraded telemedicine services. This is the only way that healthcare structures, reference hospitals of large islands, and new university hospitals can make proper use of new scientific possibilities. The Recovery Fund can also help to provide modern medicine and support all islands and populations. Otherwise, thousands of younger people will choose to leave the smaller islands due to the poor quality of the welfare state.
