Friends, demography is a huge national issue. It is a priority of PASOK and this patriotic movement to deactivate the demographic bomb. We support the family, especially young mothers in their multiple roles. We pledge that no child will stay with PASOK in government outside of a cr√®che and a creative employment centre. Every Greek mother will know in advance that her child will have a place in these public structures. We propose an increase in maternity allowance for women freelancers and a reduction in taxes for families with children. They ask us why we are proposing these tax changes. I didn't come up with them. I'm imitating them from countries that are ready to prevent disaster when we're headed for demographic catastrophe and doing nothing. It is no accident that a family with 2 children has a 10 point reduced tax rate compared to a family with no children in Portugal, 14 in the Czech Republic, and 15 in Ireland, and over 10 in most countries of the European Union that have huge demographic issues. Do you know what the difference is? 3 points? So we are committed to going at least in the first instance to 8 points of tax rate differential to support families with 2 children to deal with the demographic problem, which is a major national issue. PASOK is committed to speaking to the heart of the Greek family with social justice and a perspective for our country.
