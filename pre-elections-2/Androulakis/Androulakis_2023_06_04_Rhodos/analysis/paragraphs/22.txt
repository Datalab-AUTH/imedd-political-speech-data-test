Friends, I cannot not mention our national issues here from Rhodes and the Dodecanese. Turkey has held elections, there is a result, and there is a new government. So we are sending a clear message: we want good neighborly relations, we want de-escalation, but this requires respect for international law. Powerful interests cannot arm a country that is disrupting the wider region from the South Caucasus, the Middle East, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Because the Greek borders are not only Greek-Turkish, they are also Euro-Turkish, and they have a debt. The Europeans should do what has been voted on my initiative in the European Parliament, an arms embargo on Turkey, as long as the Erdogan government does not respect international law and undermines it. This affects the stability of the wider region and not just arming Greece. We supported the agreements with France. We supported the F-16 agreement, but there is a limit to all of this: the country's fiscal stability, the country's ability to support the welfare state, the middle class, and the vulnerable as a priority. We cannot enter into an arms rally, and when those who buy arms, in particular, are arming us and Turkey, that is why I consider it a priority not only to have an arms embargo but also for Greece to play a leading role in Europe's unified foreign policy and in the creation of the Euroarmy, as Frontex is today. We must set ourselves the goal in the next 10 years of having a Euroarmy that will guard our borders with Turkey and Cyprus and all the borders from Finland to the Republic of Cyprus.
