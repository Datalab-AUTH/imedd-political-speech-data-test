But is this not the only evidence? In 2022, the trade deficit in Greece was 12%. This year, it is set at 9.2%. If you ask them, they will tell you it's because of the pandemic and the energy crisis. This is a pan-European phenomenon, so listen to what is happening in another country with similar problems to Greece, like Portugal. Last year, while we had a 12% deficit, they had a 1% deficit, and this year we will have a 9.2% deficit. Portugal will have a 1% surplus, so it is not a general phenomenon. It is a specific phenomenon in our country: the failure of the New Democracy to build an outward-looking productive base. We have the largest trade deficit since 2010, and I am sounding the alarm here in Rhodes too, to a government of populists in ties, which disregards the intelligence of the Greek people and their real problems, increasing inequalities every day at the expense of the middle class and the poorest Greeks.
