Friends, we do not talk much about pensions. We are trying, at a specific fiscal cost, to solve the great injustices faced by 350,000 low-pensioners who are in dire straits since Mr. Tsipras abolished the EKAS. We will reinstate the new ESAS for these low-pensioners. The second issue is that we will abolish the personal differential from 1/1/24 and the unfair provisions on disability and widow's pensions. All these interventions will cost 1.1 billion euros. I call on Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras to take our programs to the budget office of the House of Representatives so that the people understand who is telling the truth and who is consciously fooling them once again. We also propose the introduction of a single pay scale for civil servants with increases for the first time in years that will cover the losses due to inflation at a total cost of 1.2 billion euros. Therefore, all our interventions in pensions and civil servants will cost 2.3 billion euros, much less than the 10 billion that they shamelessly broadcast. Gentlemen of the New Democracy.
