But is that all? There are also taxes. In the last few days, New Democracy has been accusing PASOK of expensive tax policies, but it is New Democracy that has pinned down the purchasing power of households in Greece, as the figures from Tuesday show. Since the end of the European Union, we have seen a decrease in the purchasing power of our households. New Democracy serves the few at the expense of the many. They lie because we said we want graduated taxation of dividends. We are answering them here in Rhodes, and I am talking about dividends, not corporate profits, because they are trying to distort that too. We are only talking about dividends. And I ask, is there a small, medium, or large enterprise that pays individual dividends of 100, 200, and 300,000 euros? What is that? So let me give you a simple example to see who serves the middle class, the vulnerable, the real Greek economy, and who serves the oligarchs. With the graduated taxation that we propose at 70,000 €, individual dividends pay one person a grand more. And at €120,000 individual dividend, €4000 more to have individual dividends of €150,000 a year. He must have one and a half million euros in OTE shares. There is someone here among us. So who does Mr. Mitsotakis and the media systems that flout the intelligence of the people serve, you or the oligarchs? So here is the value and the difference of the Democratic Party against a system of power that is only interested in defending the interests of the few. Their concern is not the weak and the middle class. Their anguish is the few who support them.
