In education, we do not enter the competition. The communication competition that Syriza and New Democracy are entering into, we are entering into the essence of the problem, and the essence of the problem is one and basic: if, at the moment, the center of gravity of public schooling has been transferred to private schooling, this is hurting the weakest families who do not have the money to pay millions of euros in private schooling. Thank you very much. May you all be well together, united by land and sea. We will make PASOK strong because it is here united and strong. So, while education is being privatized, we are talking about transferring the center of education back to the public school. How will this be done? It will be with the national school leaving certificate. With the national school leaving certificate, the future of the child will not be decided in only two weeks, with the stress, with the pressure, with the costs that exist today. But in the last two years, so that the children have a focus on public school and the number of tutorials is reduced and families can educate their children at low cost. We also support special education structures. It is unthinkable for a European Union country that thousands of Greek children on the autism spectrum do not have the services that other European Union countries have, and it is a priority for a socialist country to strengthen special education structures so that we can have a truly inclusive school. And, of course, innovative forms of remedial teaching to reduce inequalities, learning inequalities.
