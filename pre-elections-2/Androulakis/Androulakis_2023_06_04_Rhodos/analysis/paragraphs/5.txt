They are calling for the taxation of energy producers' excess profits. However, they themselves have not taxed suppliers' excess profits, which are in Mr. Skreka's drawer. I am also alarmed by Syriza, who until recently agreed to the graduated taxation of dividends. A few months ago, Mr. Tsipras also agreed to the taxation of banks' excess profits, as the difference between the interest rate on deposits and mortgages is the highest in the European Union. Therefore, I am surprised that in the last 10 days, they have changed their position on dividends and the taxation of bank surpluses. This is a clear demonstration of who they are and who their sponsors are. They are the only ones responsible for the 40% that Mr. Mitsotakis has taken. How else can we explain the lack of serious opposition after Tempi, the wiretapping scandal, the huge inequalities, and the widespread corruption? The only reason is that there was no credible alternative government proposal in the country, and here we are with PASOK. We need a genuine opponent of New Democracy to provide a credible alternative government proposal in the country, not just talk about it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and the rest of the week.
