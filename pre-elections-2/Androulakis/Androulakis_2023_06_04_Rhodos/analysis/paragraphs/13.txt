Beyond the cost of living, private debt is a bomb on the foundations of Greek society. Businesses and households owe millions of euros. After the mockery of Mr. Tsipras, who said "Seismicity, don't pay," and after a year, he sold billions of euros to funds that are now extorting cooperatives of small and medium-sized households. We are saying that it may not be possible to do in Seisakhthia as Mr. Tsipras was saying, also disregarding a people with huge economic and social problems. But we consider it our principle, as we did in 2010 with the PASOK law, to universally protect the first home. It is our duty that no house of a middle-class, weak Greek person should be handed over to the crows of the funds, and I am talking about the first house. There must be similar protection for agricultural property. We must not allow the de-fellatinisation of the Greek land. Also, protection for borrowers. They have taken loans in Swiss francs with the limitation of the interest cost to 1/3 of the liability and 2/3 to the banking institution. Substantial negotiation with the banks and taking measures to fight and prevent increases in interest rates on loans for weak households; reducing the profit margin of banks for consistent borrowers, because they must have incentives for all, both for those who need a second chance of dignity and for those who are consistent in their arrangements.
