Friends, populism with a tie doesn't stop there. We are told that cutting rates on VAT and excise duty is inflationary and populist. Why do we say this? I say to you, dear friends, that this issue was also addressed in the 2019 New Democracy program and in most of Mr. Mitsotakis's speeches before the 2019 elections. He talked about a minimum VAT rate and a reduced rate on indirect taxes. Now Mr. Skertsos, a former employee of the Association of Greek Industrialists who still serves them, is coming out and saying that the reduction of indirect tax rates does not help the middle class or the poor, but rather the financially powerful and the oligarchs. Economics, like medicine, physics, and mathematics, has rules. Mr. Skertsos has made his own rules and is telling the Greek people, for the first time in economic science in the world, that cutting indirect taxes does not help the poor and the middle class, but rather the oligarchs. Shame on you, gentlemen of the New Democracy, for disregarding even the elementary rules of economic science in order to defend your narratives that float away from the social reality of the country. But we are here to be a real opponent of realism and progress, and they know all too well that they no longer have a toxic opposition, but rather the strong opposition of PASOK. We say things by name and we acknowledge what is happening in all the countries of the European Union, not just in countries like Hungary and Poland that do not have strong public health, public education, and fair taxation.
