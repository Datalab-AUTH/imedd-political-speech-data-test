Friends and comrades, PASOK is here, united and strong. But PASOK is here every day, standing by each and every individual, by every citizen in need. Because we will return to being a party, a movement, and we will be close to society. We will become one with the Greek people again, and this will be the rebirth of the democratic party in this new proud era. Our concern is the many opportunities for every Greek, especially for the new generation. SYRIZA is making promises that cannot be kept, while New Democracy is trying to hide what is coming and is a product of Mr. Mitsotakis' political choices. Where are the economists who, for 10 years, have been going on TV channels and lecturing us that they have burdened the Greek people with 50 billion in new debt in 4 years? They should go on TV and tell the people that in 4 years, we have accumulated 50 billion in new debt, which means we have the largest trade deficit since 2010. This means that today, the Greek people are paying a heavy cost in matters concerning the welfare state. It also means that we are moving away from the European social model in favor of the few and powerful.
