Insularity. We all know very well that tourism is a basic source of life on our islands. It is a basic source of economy, but nothing should be left to its own devices. We have a responsibility now to create a different kind of tourism from the one we have, a quality tourism with added value, not a tourism for a few powerful businessmen. And this is not an invention; it is a best practice that has been going on for decades in Italy, Spain, and recently in Portugal. What does this mean? It means that we will not celebrate if we have 25 million tourists, but we will celebrate when a large percentage of these travelers taste domestically processed products and ask for them in winter in their homelands around the world. This will be the victory, while a modern model of tourism will give added value not only to the islands but to all of Greece with processed products, with the primary sector in priority.
