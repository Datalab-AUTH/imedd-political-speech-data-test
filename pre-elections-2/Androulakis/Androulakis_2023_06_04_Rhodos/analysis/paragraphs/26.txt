I am very happy because, after many years, PASOK has almost doubled its share among the younger generations. I am proud because this party, this movement, was created by the new generation of the time in 1974, and I aspire to have it reborn by the new generation of the time, your children and your grandchildren. PASOK knows well that victories are not given away by powerful interests. PASOK knows well that victories are won through a daily battle, village by village, town by town, every workplace. I ask you, in the next three weeks, to take the struggle of the democratic party in your hands so that on June 25th, PASOK will take another step to become a leading actor, the genuine opponent of the New Democracy. That is why the green flag of PASOK was proudly raised, and on June 25th, I pledge that we will make the democratic party strong again to have a new page of social justice and national dignity for all Greeks. We are sending a message of victory, hope, and perspective from Rhodes and the Dodecanese, from all corners of the country. Fight and be sure that in this new proud era, we will never again disappoint any Greek woman or any Greek, and we will fight for social justice and a strong future. Be well. Good strength. I ask you to take the effort into your own hands. All together, we will overturn the current correlations, the toxic correlations of discord, because our priority is to unite the people against the division that Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Mitsotakis have offered them. Good strength and good luck in your struggle. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.
