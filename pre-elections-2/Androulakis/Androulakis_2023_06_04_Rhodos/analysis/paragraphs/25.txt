So, what they do not say, we will say in the next three weeks, however much we miss them. Because the more they hit us, the stronger we become. And this is my message here from Rhodes and the Dodecanese: the more they hit PASOK, the stronger we become. PASOK will fight with the word of progress, of realism, of responsibility for the benefit of the citizen, for the benefit of the weakest Greek family. Friends, we respect the efforts and sacrifices of the Greek people. That is why I say that our priority is not to deflate the Greek economy. Our priority is to solve the demographic problem; our priority is a resilient and competitive productive base, without setbacks, without new disappointments. But what are the new disappointments? It is to say a lot and do nothing. It's rabble-rousing to get votes, and then the young people turn their backs on you.
