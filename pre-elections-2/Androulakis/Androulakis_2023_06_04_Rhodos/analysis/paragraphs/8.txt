"It slipped out from a New Democracy politician a few days ago to say, 'What do we want? Romania's model of development is not what the Greek people want.' This is the model of development that the Greek people want: a low cost of living. We will not make the country accept widespread corruption, a country where the middle class will be impoverished at the expense of the powerful. We are an old European country and we have a duty to serve the European social model that gives prospects to all citizens. The European social democratic model gives prospects to all generations."
