Friends, after the OECD report - in fact, the report that the New Democracy government despises - we can draw safe conclusions. Real wages in Greece have fallen by 7.4%. Wages are rising only in nominal terms, and of course, they will continue to fall in 2023. There is some chance of real income growth in 2024. Finally, who is lying? Is it New Democracy, OASA, or the European Commission? Obviously, Mr. Mitsotakis is lying. He disdains the intelligence of the Greek people by questioning the data of all the international organizations that show the impoverishment of the Greek people in the last years of the economic crisis.
