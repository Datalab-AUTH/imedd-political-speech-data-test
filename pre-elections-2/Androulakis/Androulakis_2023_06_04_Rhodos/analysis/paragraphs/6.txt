Friends also blame us for talking about changing the tax-free parental allowance. We are saying that the tax-free threshold should not be up to €4.8 million. I ask again, are there people among you who pass on to their children, their children's families up to €4.8 million in mobile and real estate? This concerns the middle class and the vulnerable. Only businessmen and oligarchs can be affected by this tax exemption on parental benefits up to €4.8 million. We say the limit should be €400,000 per parent, with 2 parents up to €800,000 to each child. I say this because it may not be a lot of money, but there is strong symbolism, and with a fiscal footprint, it is possible to say to young children who went abroad for a better life, to the poor Greeks who paid €5 billion more VAT than budgeted in the last 2 years, to those who see the price of milk, bread, cheese, and meat going up, that while they are in a desperate situation, while half of the public sector is stable, there will be a tax exemption of up to €4.8 million euros. There are people and journalists who spread this unfair policy that is being practiced in our country. So we are here to bring social justice and national dignity to every Greek woman and every Greek man. We are not populist. We speak in concrete terms, and our strength is that what we are saying is happening in other European countries and is bringing about a society with prospects for all, societies with a strong welfare state, with health, with education, with fair taxation, with a competitive economy.
