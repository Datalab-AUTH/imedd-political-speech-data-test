And two more issues, we owe it to all parties to pass a law, a negotiating framework with funds and borrowers, so that there are rules, solutions, and regulations, and not the rule of the annihilation of the Greek economy.

As clients, it is our priority to discuss this legislative framework with all parties in the House of Assembly, to establish a norm of noble arrangements for borrowers.
