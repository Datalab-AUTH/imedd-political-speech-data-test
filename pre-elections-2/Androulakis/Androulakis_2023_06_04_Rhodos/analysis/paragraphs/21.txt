Friends of the Greek islands, we have a duty to do things that the new democracy did not do. We are committed, in particular, to implementing the special clause of insularity in every legislative regulation that directly or indirectly concerns the Greek islands. We aim to transform the current General Secretariat of the Aegean of the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy into a modern, creative body for the exercise of executive planning in our islands. We also plan to establish an Executive Organization of Island Transport to organize planning, coordination, and monitoring of transport work. Finally, we aim to extend the measure of transport equivalence to vehicle fares, which will help to bring down the cost of transport.
