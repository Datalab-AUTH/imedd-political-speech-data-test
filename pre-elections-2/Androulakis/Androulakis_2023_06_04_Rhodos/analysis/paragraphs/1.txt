Friends, thank you very much for your presence. It is touching to see all generations of PASOK united again, strong. We come on June 25th to conquer the place that our party deserves in the democratic landscape. All generations are here, but our beloved mayor is missing, as well as our candidate Fotis Hatzidiakos, whom I wish all the best and hope to see with us soon. This struggle has just begun, and I am sure that in the coming years, our party will once again become a strong opponent of the New Democracy. We are the real progressive alternative that the Greek people and our country need.
