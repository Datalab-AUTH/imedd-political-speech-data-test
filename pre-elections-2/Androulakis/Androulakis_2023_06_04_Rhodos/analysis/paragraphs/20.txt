Friends, the cost of living includes the cost of housing. Ask yourself how many doctors and teachers find it difficult to go to the islands due to the high cost of rent, which is also present in urban centers. This is not only due to their short yearly salary, but also because it increases the cost of the real estate market. What do we propose? The state should be prepared to provide low-cost housing to all individuals appointed to serve the public sector in our islands. Additionally, we suggest the creation of a social pool of 150,000 homes in urban centers, which could be maintained at a low cost through the Recovery Fund, tax incentives, or reconstruction incentives. This would help address the issue of rising rents in major urban centers, which I am sure is also a problem here in Rhodes. There are children in Rhodes who struggle to study in Athens and Thessaloniki, and we aim to address this by allowing Greek children to choose their school based on their ambition, rather than their family's financial situation. For us, the public university is the greatest tool for social justice and upward mobility, and we will not allow financial barriers to hinder the dreams, hopes, and prospects of any Greek with a strong PASOK.
