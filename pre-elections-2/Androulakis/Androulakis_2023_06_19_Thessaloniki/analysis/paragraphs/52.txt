In the face of its petty partisan interests, we have a duty to show who represents progress, consistency, hope, and perspective. Therefore, PASOK is here, united and strong, as a party of responsibility. From this great rally in Thessaloniki, PASOK is sending a message that with us, there will be no more hollow words or promises. The Greek people want to leave these things behind and listen to the word of truth and progress. That is why I make a sincere promise to them here in Thessaloniki. We will move forward together, united. We will embrace your struggles, be by your side, do everything we can to address your problems, and strike a blow against vested interests because we have political autonomy. We are a people-born movement, which is why we are asking for a strong popular mandate on June 25th to take small and big decisive steps together, to make a new start, to fight for better days, with our values, principles, positions, ideas, and demands. Therefore, I call on every democrat and progressive, regardless of their past choices, to join forces on June 25th and create a strong social political majority of the modern center-left. A strong PASOK that will not vote for what must be heard, what must be said, what serves the few, but will vote and support what the country and the people owe for better days, social justice, and national dignity. This party has historically been the engine of hope and the creative forces of the country. That is why we will serve the people without regard to political cost. We will serve the people with humanity in the face of cynicism, with seriousness in the face of arrogance, with certainty in the face of uncertainty, and with responsibility in the face of unreliability. I call on you on Sunday, June 25th, to fight for the great victory, to make a decision of change, a decision of social justice and national dignity together. There are only a few days left to achieve the great goal, the goal that some years ago our political opponents considered impossible. We will achieve it on June 25th with the birth of our movement, the rebirth of the democratic party. We are putting the people back in the lead, putting the citizen, the man, the woman, the worker, the youth, and the peasant back in the lead in a strong, social, progressive movement. Together for the new great change. Be well and good luck in our struggle. PASOK here from democratic Thessaloniki sends a message of victory throughout Greece. On June 25th, we will be the great winners. On June 25th, we become again the genuine opponent of maintenance in our country. Be well, take the struggle in your hands. Raise proudly the flag of the democratic party. Thank you. Friends, yesterday from Crete and today from Thessaloniki, the message is clear. On June 25th, a new great victory for the historic social movement is coming. Be well, fight together, united, strong in this new era in which we have a duty to turn the page for the Greek people, to make our country strong and proud again. I thank you from the bottom of my heart and pledge that in this new era, we will not let any Greek woman or man down. Bless you, thank you.
