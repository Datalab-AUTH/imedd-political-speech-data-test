The New Democracy is allowing the inflation of profits and obscenity to be created, pretending that it will deal with the problem with temporary passes. This reminds me of Latin America where inflation has been galloping for years, through the tax they collect and then hand out benefits with no prospects. Greece is a normal European country and wants market control against obscenity. It needs permanent political reforms so that there can be meritocracy and transparency, and not prices rising rapidly but falling like a feather. This is not European normality, this is a distortion that helps powerful interests.
