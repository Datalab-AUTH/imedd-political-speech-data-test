The people who made AUEP, transparency, open government, independent authorities, and everything that made Greece a normal European country, despite our mistakes. This is our great political legacy, and I pledge that we will keep this flag flying high. We are building a relationship of trust with every Greek, and we will ensure that what hurt the Greek people will not happen again.
