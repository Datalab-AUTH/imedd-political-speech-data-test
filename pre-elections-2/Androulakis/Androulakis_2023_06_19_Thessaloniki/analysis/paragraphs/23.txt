So we say we are the new, and we truly are the brave change that our country needs. We pledge clarity and meritocracy everywhere. And what does that mean? It means meritocracy in recruitment, strengthening of independent authorities, de-partisanship of the state with selection of administrations and organizations not through every Mega-Maximou that sees the state as a tool of bribery, but with an open international competition for all Greeks to submit their CVs with competence, transparency, and the best of them to serve the people and the country for the next 5 years, without being linked to electoral circles so that every prime minister can say that he has created an executive state with his company. No, we are not building a staff state. We are tearing down the bureaucracy and the client state of the New Democracy.
