Friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart. PASOK is here, united, and strong. June 25th is the day of the rebirth of the democratic party. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm welcome. A welcome that sends a message of victory to our whole country. Just a few days left until the great victory, the next big step on June 25th. The first step was taken on May 21st. On June 25th, we continue because we have a duty to complete what we started: another victorious struggle. Our country needs a strong, credible opposition that can adequately stand up to maintenance, arrogance, and the client state. I therefore call on every democrat and every progressive citizen here in Thessaloniki on June 25th to unite our struggles, to unite our hopes, to unite our forces. I pledge that the rebirth of the democratic party will make the voice of our people even stronger so that we can fight together for social justice and national dignity. Together in this new era, we will build a future of dignity and perspective for every Greek woman, for every Greek man, for all generations. Our movement will be strong and dynamic in the face of new struggles.
