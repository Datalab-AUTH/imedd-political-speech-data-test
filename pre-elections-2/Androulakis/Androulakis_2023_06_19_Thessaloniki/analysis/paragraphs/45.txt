Friends, recently some people have been trying, as they did before the May 21 elections, to impose new fears about your choice. They say there is a fear of ungovernability, as if we don't see what happened on the first Sunday of 21. With the alleged scenario of an August election, they are trying to scare the younger generation, saying in essence, "vote for Mitsotakis so that he doesn't spoil your holidays." I say vote for PASOK so that New Democracy has a real opponent and so that they do not impose fear of choice. Vote so that there is no set-off, so that you do not choose on the basis of the worst not happening, but on the basis of the best hope, the best future, the best prospects. That is why there is no fear of ungovernability. There is fear of omnipotence, arrogance, impunity, corruption, and injustice. That is why we need a strong PASOK to oppose maintenance and populism in our country.
