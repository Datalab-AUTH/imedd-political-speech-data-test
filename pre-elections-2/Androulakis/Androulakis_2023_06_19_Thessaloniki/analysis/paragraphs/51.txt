But is it a progressive stance to promise debt relief and hand over millions of non-performing loans to funds, using the toil and sacrifice of the Greek people? Or is it truly progressive and leftist to advocate for justice everywhere, but when his closest collaborator, Mr. Pappas, is convicted by the judiciary, instead of sending him home, he has him featured on his ballot papers? This is certainly neither leftist nor progressive.
