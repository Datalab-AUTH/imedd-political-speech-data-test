I call on you from Thessaloniki to move forward together so that New Democracy can regain its real and historical rival, our movement. Our movement can impose respect for the welfare state, human rights, the separation of powers, and sustainable development with its progressive discourse and specific program. I call on every Greek to join forces and make our movement strong again against powerful interests that do not want Greece to be a normal European country. They speculate at the expense of the Greek people during the years of the energy crisis and the economic crisis when the income of the average family was falling, they earned billions. New Democracy is the stooge of powerful interests.
