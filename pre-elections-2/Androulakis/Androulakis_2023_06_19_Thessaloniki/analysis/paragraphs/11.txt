Also, taking advantage of the fiscal relaxation due to the pandemic and the energy crisis, they distributed more than 55 billion without social and developmental targeting. When they have money, they distribute it unfairly to a few friends and cronies. But when the bill comes, they take it again unfairly from the many, from all of you. That was, that is New Democracy, and it even responds by saying that it has reduced tax rates. Indeed, they did reduce taxes compared to the tax storm of the Syriza period's social security contributions and rates, but there is also the fiscal reality. 7 billion in 4 years of tax cuts for the Greek people, more for the powerful, less for the middle class and the most vulnerable, but at the same time, instead of 7 billion in 4 years, in a year and a half, a year and 8 months, they took 5 billion more from the budgeted indirect taxes hitting the middle class and the vulnerable with excise tax and VAT. And this is where Mr Skertsos responds to any economic theory that VAT is paid by the oligarchs. There is no limit to unreliability and depravity.
