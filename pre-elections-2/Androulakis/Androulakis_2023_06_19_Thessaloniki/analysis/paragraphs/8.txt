Therefore, on June 25th, we take one more step to represent the majority of the progressive, democratic world in our country. Friends, Greece needs a strong progressive force of reason to become strong again in Europe, to be a protagonist rather than a laggard in developments, and to restore dignity and self-confidence to the Greek people. You deserve much more than what SYRIZA and New Democracy have offered. No more of their compromises.
