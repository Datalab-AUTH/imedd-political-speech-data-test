In order to conceal its indifference towards the city, New Democracy announces and takes credit for projects that are already being carried out by the local government or even by private individuals.

He urges people to count the projects that the government will undertake, while ignoring the daily struggles of local governments and private citizens in their efforts to improve the city.
