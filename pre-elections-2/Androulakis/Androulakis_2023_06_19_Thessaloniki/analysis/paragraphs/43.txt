But why do we say that? Because we are the PASOK that, in 1995, broke down the barriers of shame with Andreas Papandreou. We are the PASOK that, a few years later, opened Greek universities to Greek Muslims with the 5 percent education law, resulting in a fivefold increase in the number of scientists who are Greek Muslims in Thrace 20 years later. We are the ones who have faced discrimination of all kinds in our country. That is why we are the democratic party, fighting for unity and not the division of the people.
