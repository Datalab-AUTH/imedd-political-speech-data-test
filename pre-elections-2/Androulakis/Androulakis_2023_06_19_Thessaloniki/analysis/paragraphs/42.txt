But in the last few days, we have once again witnessed frivolity, unreliability, discord, and ineptitude. Both Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras must leave dangerous adventurism and electoral issues concerning the intelligence of the National Intelligence Agency out of the elections. Things are too simple for us. There must not be a member of the Greek Parliament who questions the Treaty of Lausanne, whether Christian or Muslim. No one should talk about a Muslim minority, and certainly not a Turkish minority. Anyone who challenges the Treaty of Lausanne is working against our country.
