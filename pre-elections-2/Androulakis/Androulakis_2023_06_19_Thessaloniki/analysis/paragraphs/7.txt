Friends, let us come together to strengthen the progressive discourse and give hope to all Greek people. This party has historically fought not for power, but for unity; not for division, but for hope and perspective. That is why I ask you to succeed together on June 25th, and I am sure that with daily struggle, PASOK will once again be the great progressive protagonist of developments. Friends, on June 25th, I call on every Greek citizen to put an end to this toxic dichotomy and support the effort we have started step by step throughout Greece. I therefore call on all democrats to give strength with their vote to PASOK-Movement for Change so that there can finally be a strong, credible, effective opposition, and not the sponsor of New Democracy. We need to have a strong progressive mound with PASOK against the authoritarianism, the client state, and the maintenance represented by the New Democracy party. Our guarantee is to defend the welfare state, freedoms, rights, and the quality of democracy. Our guarantee is growth, justice, benefits for all, and not only for the few. Of course, we want our children, the Greek children in our country, to stay in our country to create without inequalities, but with opportunities for all, for the whole Greek society. This is the agony of the democratic party: a strong PASOK that, with its modern program, is an alternative progressive proposal for the governance of the country. Our ambition is to govern the country in the interests of the people and the country. We are not fighting a battle for a chair; we are fighting a battle for the people and the country, for a better future, for an era of prosperity, dignity, hope, and prospects.
