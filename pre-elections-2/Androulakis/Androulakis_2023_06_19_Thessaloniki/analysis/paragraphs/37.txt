The current situation. Together, we hold the future of many generations in our hands, and we have a duty to offer a progressive solution, a democratic solution, hope, and dignity for the future of all generations, all Greeks, and all regions on June 25. This is what we have always been: the movement that genuinely embraces the anxieties, the real anxieties of the Greek people. Friends, we have a duty to reverse the current situation, which is far from what Thessaloniki deserves.
