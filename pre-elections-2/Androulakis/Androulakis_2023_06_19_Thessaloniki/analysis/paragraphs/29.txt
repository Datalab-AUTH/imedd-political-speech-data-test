We insist on protecting primary residences because private debt undermines the foundations of society and the economy. We aim to protect primary residences in accordance with the 2010 law that we achieved during the most difficult times against the Troika. We also aim to protect agricultural land and pass a law that imposes rules for borrowers to negotiate with funds, giving priority to regulation rather than elimination of the borrower. Funds that came here to speculate by buying 5-10% of Greek people's loans and wanting to sell them for a profit, only to move on and destroy another society, will be subject to rules of dignity. We believe in second chances for all citizens who fought honorably but did not survive the crisis. For borrowers with Swiss franc loans, we propose a solution where 1/3 of the interest burden is borne by them and 2/3 is borne by the bank for all companies and private individuals. This will allow them to settle their loans and plan for the future with financial stability.
