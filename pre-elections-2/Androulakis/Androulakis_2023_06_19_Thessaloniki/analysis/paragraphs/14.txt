Friends, conservationism is damaging our society from both the right and the left. That is why we have a duty to appeal to every democrat, every progressive from the left, the center, and the center-left. This is our history, our ideology, and our duty to our people and our country. Friends, PASOK is present in every village and every town, a river of change, renewal, and perspective. Therefore, let us proudly raise the flag of PASOK, loved by millions of Greeks. We have a duty to revive this democratic movement.
