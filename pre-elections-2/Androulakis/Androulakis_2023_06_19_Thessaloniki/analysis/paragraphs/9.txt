Friends, many media outlets, as well as the executives of New Democracy, present an idyllic picture of the economy, but it does not correspond to reality. Do you know who we are going to trust? The OECD? The European Commission or the executives of New Democracy? I say we should trust the international organisations that say that wages in our country did not increase by 20%, but real income fell by 7.4%. Wages are nominally rising, but real incomes have fallen for many Greek workers. New Democracy, in response to these organizations, is saying, okay, let's move forward, let's look to the future, and they've put spots in the social media and on television pledging a 25% increase in the average private sector wage. Do you trust them? I don't at all because they already submitted a mid-term to the European Commission just before the last election, talking about a 13% wage increase. 25 for pre-election consumption in Greece, 13 in Brussels.
