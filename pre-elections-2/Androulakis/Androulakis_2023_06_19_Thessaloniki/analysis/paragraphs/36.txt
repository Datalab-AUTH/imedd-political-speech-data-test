Friends, I want to address some specific issues concerning the city of Thessaloniki, as well as Central Macedonia and Northern Greece in general. We have a responsibility to utilize its geostrategic location by connecting it with neighboring countries. Thessaloniki has the potential to regain its status as the metropolis and true economic and cultural capital of the Balkans, as it has been throughout its history.
