And we will respond by taxing the excess profits of all those who have speculated for 2 years on the backs of the most vulnerable and the middle class. We are pushing for institutional substantive measures that protect households, including the reduction of SME indirect taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, effective market controls, and production reduction measures for our farmers and livestock farmers. Even a part of the EUR 5 billion in indirect tax overpayments due to inflation must be allocated to support these groups. Our first concern is those outside the walls, who should not be abandoned by a socialist, progressive party to agony, despair, and desperation. I pledge here in Thessaloniki that in this new era, we will stand by the side of the vulnerable and the middle class. That was our movement. That is what we will become again with our daily struggle to embrace the struggles of all these people.
