It is not allowed to play election games on these issues. It is a disgrace for Mrs Bakoyannis, with her experience, for Mr Skirtsos, and for Mr Mitsotakis' right-hand man to threaten Greek citizens with a vocabulary of the Right from the 50s and 60s that Andreas Papandreou discarded. This vocabulary is far from any form of European acquis, gentlemen of New Democracy. It is a disgrace, no matter what mistakes our political opponents make, to talk about national exceptions. Because, gentlemen of New Democracy, you are not your country. We are all Greeks, united and not divided. The homeland belongs to all Greeks, beyond parties, religions, and social classes.
