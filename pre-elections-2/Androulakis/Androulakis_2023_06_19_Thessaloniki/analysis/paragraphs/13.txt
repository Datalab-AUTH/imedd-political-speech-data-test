But where are they? The well-known economists and scientists who, during the years of the memoranda, told us every morning about the external deficit and the public debt? They have suddenly disappeared. So let us tell them: the public debt increased by 45 billion during the four years of Mr Mitsotakis. This led to a jump in the current account deficit and external deficit, the largest since 2010, at 12% for Greece last year, and this year it is projected to be 9.2%. They respond that it is happening all over Europe because of the energy crisis. We reply that they are lying, because in Portugal, with similar problems to our country, the deficit last year was 1%, and this year they are projecting a surplus of 1%. Other countries are following suit. The worst fiscal situation is the one that led our country again, with New Democracy imitating Mr Karamanlis in 2007. This is maintenance. This is the client state. This is the fiscal populism of the current era.
