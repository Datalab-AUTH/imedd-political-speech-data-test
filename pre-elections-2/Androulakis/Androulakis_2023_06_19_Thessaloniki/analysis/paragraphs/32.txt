Friends, I cannot stop talking about the green transition. When we first raised this issue, the New Republic replied that we were talking about green horses. It has been 15 years since then, but the green transition is here. What is it missing? It is not fair. It is not for the many. It is not for our municipal energy communities, hospitals, farmers, cooperatives, or processors. It is for 5 or 6 oligarchs, and that is not a democratic, just, green transition. It is a New Democracy project to pamper powerful economic interests.
