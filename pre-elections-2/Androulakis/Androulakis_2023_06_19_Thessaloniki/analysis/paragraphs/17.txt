And not to celebrate the millions of visitors who came to Greece, but what they left behind in all sectors of the economy. To have real growth throughout the Greek periphery, to regenerate our country economically, to become a strong, outward-looking, productive power and not trade deficits, the strain on natural wealth and billions of euros to the powerful, and not the distribution of profits through sustainable development in all regions of the country. We have a duty to invest in agri-food, in our organic products, in manufacturing, and Greece's productive goal is for those who come here to look for them on the shelves of their local shops in all the other months of the country. This means fair development for the benefit of the Greek people, for the benefit of regional development, for the benefit of the younger generations. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a duty to respond in a realistic way to the field of price controls.
