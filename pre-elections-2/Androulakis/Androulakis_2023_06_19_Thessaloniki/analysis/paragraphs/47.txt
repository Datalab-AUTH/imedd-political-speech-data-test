And I say this because Mr Mitsotakis is a good man. There have been failures, yes, but Syriza was worse. When failures occur, we must choose with the best days in mind, not rely on fear to prevent the worst from happening. That is why I call on you to fight every day to build relationships of trust with the Greek people and to tear down the mechanism of fear. We must build a mechanism of hope for the best that the Greek people and our country deserve. So, friends, as we enter this new era, we will succeed together in making the Democratic Party the voice of progress and once again the protagonist. With a few days left, let us fight and on June 25th, we will be the great winners. Friends, we cannot afford four more wasted years with an ineffective opposition and an arrogant government. If PASOK is strong, there will be no four wasted years because with a real opposition in and out of parliament, New Democracy will be forced to have a real opponent to put a damper on the pathologies it is leading.
