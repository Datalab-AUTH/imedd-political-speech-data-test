That is why we propose another plan that advocates for strong primary healthcare everywhere. We suggest allocating 8-10% of the resources from the Recovery Fund to cover all staff vacancies, permanent recruitment, and salaries at the average rate of the European Union. This will prevent our doctors from studying here and then leaving to work abroad. Additionally, we advocate for the inclusion of heavy and unhealthy work for all healthcare workers. We have a duty to fulfill our pandemic commitment.
