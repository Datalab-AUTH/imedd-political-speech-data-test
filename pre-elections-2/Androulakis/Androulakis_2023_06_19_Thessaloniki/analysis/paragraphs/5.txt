Friends, we have a debt. We have a historic debt to move forward with a new political ethos against viciousness and cynicism. Against those who, even in the last few weeks, are ready to play divisive games with Thrace and the tragic shipwreck. Without ideology, principles, and values, because the compass of Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras is only power.
