I am committed to covering all children in cr√®ches and creative activity centres without exception. Tax exemptions should be provided not only for large families or families with three children, but also for families with two children, with a tax rate reduction of 8-10%, as is the case in other European countries. In Greece, this is currently only available for families with three or more children. We prioritize tax relief for families with more than two children to provide incentives and create conditions for young couples with prospects, in order to counter the danger of demographic shrinkage.
