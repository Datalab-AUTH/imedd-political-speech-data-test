I heard Mr. Mitsotakis claim that all the talk about water privatization is lies and unsubstantiated rumors. However, these are rumors that he himself created. In February 2022, the Council of State decided that EYATH and EYDAP must return from the State Treasury, which had been placed there in 2016 by Mr. Tsipras. It should be noted that the Council of State had said that they should return to the public sector, something that Mr. Mitsotakis has not done for four years. Do you trust him? I certainly do not.
