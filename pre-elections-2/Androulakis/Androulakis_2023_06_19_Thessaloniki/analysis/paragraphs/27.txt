Friends, a huge issue in Greek society is education. We do not shy away from it. We want a major educational reform that will focus on public schools in order to break down inequalities and discrimination, so that families whose children want to realize their dreams of a better future no longer have to bear high costs. That is why we are proposing the national baccalaureate, so that public education can once again become a leading player and not a high-cost school. With the national baccalaureate, there will be no 15-day exam to judge the student's future, but in 2 years they will be able to achieve their goals through multiple exams. And of course, we prioritize a safe school environment with psychological and social support services. Finally, it is crucial for a socialist movement to invest in strong special education structures to make Greece a normal European country with an inclusive school and not thousands of families who are unable to reach benefits to provide the services their children on the autism spectrum need.
