Finally, we have a concrete, costed, non-populist program for pensioners that can be put into practice tomorrow morning. We propose a new ESAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners who are in desperate circumstances, which Mr. Tsipras has abolished. This includes the abolition of the personal differential from 01/01/24 and a change in the replacement rates. All in all, it will cost one billion 130 million.
