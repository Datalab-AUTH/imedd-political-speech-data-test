As far as public health is concerned, the situation is disheartening. Despite the fact that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of the National Health System, which the right wing despised, the government has despised the maintenance of what PASOK created, because the National Health System is the great child of PASOK, with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos as protagonists. We have seen tragic events and shortcomings in the EKAB. Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Papanikolaou hospital in Thessaloniki and was informed that three and a half thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting on shameful waiting lists for an operation and will be waiting for quite a while because there are only 7 of the 28 permanent anaesthetists. This is the public health that New Democracy boasts about. But you know, I don't like to talk in the air like Syriza. I like to talk with facts, and the facts are deafening. New Democracy brought private health care spending for the Greek people to be the third-highest in the European Union in the first years of its government. We were only surpassed by Bulgaria and Lithuania. And a few days ago, looking again at the official figures, I discovered something new. Our position has gotten worse in the last two years of Mr Mitsotakis' government. We went from third to second. Only the Greek people and Bulgaria paid such a cost of private expenditure, while the European Union gave 30 billion to the pandemic development fund. These are Mr Mitsotakis' sensibilities and priorities far removed from the real, everyday problems of our people.
