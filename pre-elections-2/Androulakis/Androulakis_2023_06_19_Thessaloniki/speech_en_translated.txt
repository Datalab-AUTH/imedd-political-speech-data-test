Friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart. PASOK is here, united, and strong. June 25th is the day of the rebirth of the democratic party. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm welcome. A welcome that sends a message of victory to our whole country. Just a few days left until the great victory, the next big step on June 25th. The first step was taken on May 21st. On June 25th, we continue because we have a duty to complete what we started: another victorious struggle. Our country needs a strong, credible opposition that can adequately stand up to maintenance, arrogance, and the client state. I therefore call on every democrat and every progressive citizen here in Thessaloniki on June 25th to unite our struggles, to unite our hopes, to unite our forces. I pledge that the rebirth of the democratic party will make the voice of our people even stronger so that we can fight together for social justice and national dignity. Together in this new era, we will build a future of dignity and perspective for every Greek woman, for every Greek man, for all generations. Our movement will be strong and dynamic in the face of new struggles.

Friends, we have a duty to fight inside and outside of parliament for a modern center-left that will once again become the driving force for improving our political system. We must fight against the toxicity, division, elitism, populism, and digital gangs that New Democracy and SYRIZA have established in recent years at the expense of reason and the public interest.

I call on you from Thessaloniki to move forward together so that New Democracy can regain its real and historical rival, our movement. Our movement can impose respect for the welfare state, human rights, the separation of powers, and sustainable development with its progressive discourse and specific program. I call on every Greek to join forces and make our movement strong again against powerful interests that do not want Greece to be a normal European country. They speculate at the expense of the Greek people during the years of the energy crisis and the economic crisis when the income of the average family was falling, they earned billions. New Democracy is the stooge of powerful interests.

We will implement transparency rules in the market. We serve the people and the country, the public interest, and not the interests of the powerful.

Friends, we have a debt. We have a historic debt to move forward with a new political ethos against viciousness and cynicism. Against those who, even in the last few weeks, are ready to play divisive games with Thrace and the tragic shipwreck. Without ideology, principles, and values, because the compass of Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras is only power.

Our flag is the principles and values of a democratic, progressive movement that does not toy with national issues or human rights.

Friends, let us come together to strengthen the progressive discourse and give hope to all Greek people. This party has historically fought not for power, but for unity; not for division, but for hope and perspective. That is why I ask you to succeed together on June 25th, and I am sure that with daily struggle, PASOK will once again be the great progressive protagonist of developments. Friends, on June 25th, I call on every Greek citizen to put an end to this toxic dichotomy and support the effort we have started step by step throughout Greece. I therefore call on all democrats to give strength with their vote to PASOK-Movement for Change so that there can finally be a strong, credible, effective opposition, and not the sponsor of New Democracy. We need to have a strong progressive mound with PASOK against the authoritarianism, the client state, and the maintenance represented by the New Democracy party. Our guarantee is to defend the welfare state, freedoms, rights, and the quality of democracy. Our guarantee is growth, justice, benefits for all, and not only for the few. Of course, we want our children, the Greek children in our country, to stay in our country to create without inequalities, but with opportunities for all, for the whole Greek society. This is the agony of the democratic party: a strong PASOK that, with its modern program, is an alternative progressive proposal for the governance of the country. Our ambition is to govern the country in the interests of the people and the country. We are not fighting a battle for a chair; we are fighting a battle for the people and the country, for a better future, for an era of prosperity, dignity, hope, and prospects.

Therefore, on June 25th, we take one more step to represent the majority of the progressive, democratic world in our country. Friends, Greece needs a strong progressive force of reason to become strong again in Europe, to be a protagonist rather than a laggard in developments, and to restore dignity and self-confidence to the Greek people. You deserve much more than what SYRIZA and New Democracy have offered. No more of their compromises.

Friends, many media outlets, as well as the executives of New Democracy, present an idyllic picture of the economy, but it does not correspond to reality. Do you know who we are going to trust? The OECD? The European Commission or the executives of New Democracy? I say we should trust the international organisations that say that wages in our country did not increase by 20%, but real income fell by 7.4%. Wages are nominally rising, but real incomes have fallen for many Greek workers. New Democracy, in response to these organizations, is saying, okay, let's move forward, let's look to the future, and they've put spots in the social media and on television pledging a 25% increase in the average private sector wage. Do you trust them? I don't at all because they already submitted a mid-term to the European Commission just before the last election, talking about a 13% wage increase. 25 for pre-election consumption in Greece, 13 in Brussels.

This is Mr. Mitsotakis' credibility, and I ask the Greek people to turn their backs on depravity, unworthiness, and mockery.

Also, taking advantage of the fiscal relaxation due to the pandemic and the energy crisis, they distributed more than 55 billion without social and developmental targeting. When they have money, they distribute it unfairly to a few friends and cronies. But when the bill comes, they take it again unfairly from the many, from all of you. That was, that is New Democracy, and it even responds by saying that it has reduced tax rates. Indeed, they did reduce taxes compared to the tax storm of the Syriza period's social security contributions and rates, but there is also the fiscal reality. 7 billion in 4 years of tax cuts for the Greek people, more for the powerful, less for the middle class and the most vulnerable, but at the same time, instead of 7 billion in 4 years, in a year and a half, a year and 8 months, they took 5 billion more from the budgeted indirect taxes hitting the middle class and the vulnerable with excise tax and VAT. And this is where Mr Skertsos responds to any economic theory that VAT is paid by the oligarchs. There is no limit to unreliability and depravity.

In the face of this arrogance, we respond with words of consistency, dignity, progress, social justice, and fiscal justice.

But where are they? The well-known economists and scientists who, during the years of the memoranda, told us every morning about the external deficit and the public debt? They have suddenly disappeared. So let us tell them: the public debt increased by 45 billion during the four years of Mr Mitsotakis. This led to a jump in the current account deficit and external deficit, the largest since 2010, at 12% for Greece last year, and this year it is projected to be 9.2%. They respond that it is happening all over Europe because of the energy crisis. We reply that they are lying, because in Portugal, with similar problems to our country, the deficit last year was 1%, and this year they are projecting a surplus of 1%. Other countries are following suit. The worst fiscal situation is the one that led our country again, with New Democracy imitating Mr Karamanlis in 2007. This is maintenance. This is the client state. This is the fiscal populism of the current era.

Friends, conservationism is damaging our society from both the right and the left. That is why we have a duty to appeal to every democrat, every progressive from the left, the center, and the center-left. This is our history, our ideology, and our duty to our people and our country. Friends, PASOK is present in every village and every town, a river of change, renewal, and perspective. Therefore, let us proudly raise the flag of PASOK, loved by millions of Greeks. We have a duty to revive this democratic movement.

But let's see, my friends, what happened to the Recovery Fund and its valuable resources. These resources were mainly used for the benefit of the few, the wealthy, and the powerful, leaving little money to finance Greek small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives, producers, and manufacturers.

Therefore, we propose a productive development of Made in Greece that unites tourism, agri-food, and manufacturing against these dead-end policies of the New Democracy.

And not to celebrate the millions of visitors who came to Greece, but what they left behind in all sectors of the economy. To have real growth throughout the Greek periphery, to regenerate our country economically, to become a strong, outward-looking, productive power and not trade deficits, the strain on natural wealth and billions of euros to the powerful, and not the distribution of profits through sustainable development in all regions of the country. We have a duty to invest in agri-food, in our organic products, in manufacturing, and Greece's productive goal is for those who come here to look for them on the shelves of their local shops in all the other months of the country. This means fair development for the benefit of the Greek people, for the benefit of regional development, for the benefit of the younger generations. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a duty to respond in a realistic way to the field of price controls.

The New Democracy is allowing the inflation of profits and obscenity to be created, pretending that it will deal with the problem with temporary passes. This reminds me of Latin America where inflation has been galloping for years, through the tax they collect and then hand out benefits with no prospects. Greece is a normal European country and wants market control against obscenity. It needs permanent political reforms so that there can be meritocracy and transparency, and not prices rising rapidly but falling like a feather. This is not European normality, this is a distortion that helps powerful interests.

And we will respond by taxing the excess profits of all those who have speculated for 2 years on the backs of the most vulnerable and the middle class. We are pushing for institutional substantive measures that protect households, including the reduction of SME indirect taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, effective market controls, and production reduction measures for our farmers and livestock farmers. Even a part of the EUR 5 billion in indirect tax overpayments due to inflation must be allocated to support these groups. Our first concern is those outside the walls, who should not be abandoned by a socialist, progressive party to agony, despair, and desperation. I pledge here in Thessaloniki that in this new era, we will stand by the side of the vulnerable and the middle class. That was our movement. That is what we will become again with our daily struggle to embrace the struggles of all these people.

Friends, New Democracy has the nerve to accuse PASOK of partisanship and old partisanship. Who is accusing us? Those who did not vote for any meritocracy reform. And who are they accusing?

The people who made AUEP, transparency, open government, independent authorities, and everything that made Greece a normal European country, despite our mistakes. This is our great political legacy, and I pledge that we will keep this flag flying high. We are building a relationship of trust with every Greek, and we will ensure that what hurt the Greek people will not happen again.

But who are they accusing us? Let's talk about today's accusations, the recent ones against Mr. Mitsotakis. Are you the one who gave 10 billion in direct commissions, hiding behind the pandemic? Are you the one who clashed with independent authorities and the rule of law with the bugging scandal, and covered up for your closest relative and partner? Are you the young man who exposed the country internationally? Or are you the one responsible for bringing a record number of temporary employees to the public sector, surpassing even the Syriza era with the Independent Greeks?

So we say we are the new, and we truly are the brave change that our country needs. We pledge clarity and meritocracy everywhere. And what does that mean? It means meritocracy in recruitment, strengthening of independent authorities, de-partisanship of the state with selection of administrations and organizations not through every Mega-Maximou that sees the state as a tool of bribery, but with an open international competition for all Greeks to submit their CVs with competence, transparency, and the best of them to serve the people and the country for the next 5 years, without being linked to electoral circles so that every prime minister can say that he has created an executive state with his company. No, we are not building a staff state. We are tearing down the bureaucracy and the client state of the New Democracy.

Friends, we support the workers who are fighting for better conditions. We strengthen their perspective and promote new regulations for labor relations through social dialogue. We advocate for work with rules and security, with dignified wages determined by free collective bargaining and strong control mechanisms.

As far as public health is concerned, the situation is disheartening. Despite the fact that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of the National Health System, which the right wing despised, the government has despised the maintenance of what PASOK created, because the National Health System is the great child of PASOK, with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos as protagonists. We have seen tragic events and shortcomings in the EKAB. Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Papanikolaou hospital in Thessaloniki and was informed that three and a half thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting on shameful waiting lists for an operation and will be waiting for quite a while because there are only 7 of the 28 permanent anaesthetists. This is the public health that New Democracy boasts about. But you know, I don't like to talk in the air like Syriza. I like to talk with facts, and the facts are deafening. New Democracy brought private health care spending for the Greek people to be the third-highest in the European Union in the first years of its government. We were only surpassed by Bulgaria and Lithuania. And a few days ago, looking again at the official figures, I discovered something new. Our position has gotten worse in the last two years of Mr Mitsotakis' government. We went from third to second. Only the Greek people and Bulgaria paid such a cost of private expenditure, while the European Union gave 30 billion to the pandemic development fund. These are Mr Mitsotakis' sensibilities and priorities far removed from the real, everyday problems of our people.

That is why we propose another plan that advocates for strong primary healthcare everywhere. We suggest allocating 8-10% of the resources from the Recovery Fund to cover all staff vacancies, permanent recruitment, and salaries at the average rate of the European Union. This will prevent our doctors from studying here and then leaving to work abroad. Additionally, we advocate for the inclusion of heavy and unhealthy work for all healthcare workers. We have a duty to fulfill our pandemic commitment.

Friends, a huge issue in Greek society is education. We do not shy away from it. We want a major educational reform that will focus on public schools in order to break down inequalities and discrimination, so that families whose children want to realize their dreams of a better future no longer have to bear high costs. That is why we are proposing the national baccalaureate, so that public education can once again become a leading player and not a high-cost school. With the national baccalaureate, there will be no 15-day exam to judge the student's future, but in 2 years they will be able to achieve their goals through multiple exams. And of course, we prioritize a safe school environment with psychological and social support services. Finally, it is crucial for a socialist movement to invest in strong special education structures to make Greece a normal European country with an inclusive school and not thousands of families who are unable to reach benefits to provide the services their children on the autism spectrum need.

Finally, we have a concrete, costed, non-populist program for pensioners that can be put into practice tomorrow morning. We propose a new ESAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners who are in desperate circumstances, which Mr. Tsipras has abolished. This includes the abolition of the personal differential from 01/01/24 and a change in the replacement rates. All in all, it will cost one billion 130 million.

We insist on protecting primary residences because private debt undermines the foundations of society and the economy. We aim to protect primary residences in accordance with the 2010 law that we achieved during the most difficult times against the Troika. We also aim to protect agricultural land and pass a law that imposes rules for borrowers to negotiate with funds, giving priority to regulation rather than elimination of the borrower. Funds that came here to speculate by buying 5-10% of Greek people's loans and wanting to sell them for a profit, only to move on and destroy another society, will be subject to rules of dignity. We believe in second chances for all citizens who fought honorably but did not survive the crisis. For borrowers with Swiss franc loans, we propose a solution where 1/3 of the interest burden is borne by them and 2/3 is borne by the bank for all companies and private individuals. This will allow them to settle their loans and plan for the future with financial stability.

Friends, a huge issue for our country is demography. We can address this threat by proposing 150,000 social housing units to keep down the cost of living for young couples, especially at a time when rents are soaring in all major urban centers.

I am committed to covering all children in crèches and creative activity centres without exception. Tax exemptions should be provided not only for large families or families with three children, but also for families with two children, with a tax rate reduction of 8-10%, as is the case in other European countries. In Greece, this is currently only available for families with three or more children. We prioritize tax relief for families with more than two children to provide incentives and create conditions for young couples with prospects, in order to counter the danger of demographic shrinkage.

Friends, I cannot stop talking about the green transition. When we first raised this issue, the New Republic replied that we were talking about green horses. It has been 15 years since then, but the green transition is here. What is it missing? It is not fair. It is not for the many. It is not for our municipal energy communities, hospitals, farmers, cooperatives, or processors. It is for 5 or 6 oligarchs, and that is not a democratic, just, green transition. It is a New Democracy project to pamper powerful economic interests.

Friends, we are committed to giving priority to all previous categories in terms of connection in order to protect production costs and the Greek people in a new period of energy poverty. We will implement a different plan from the one implemented by New Democracy.

PASOK also ensures that water remains a public good.

I heard Mr. Mitsotakis claim that all the talk about water privatization is lies and unsubstantiated rumors. However, these are rumors that he himself created. In February 2022, the Council of State decided that EYATH and EYDAP must return from the State Treasury, which had been placed there in 2016 by Mr. Tsipras. It should be noted that the Council of State had said that they should return to the public sector, something that Mr. Mitsotakis has not done for four years. Do you trust him? I certainly do not.

Friends, I want to address some specific issues concerning the city of Thessaloniki, as well as Central Macedonia and Northern Greece in general. We have a responsibility to utilize its geostrategic location by connecting it with neighboring countries. Thessaloniki has the potential to regain its status as the metropolis and true economic and cultural capital of the Balkans, as it has been throughout its history.

The current situation. Together, we hold the future of many generations in our hands, and we have a duty to offer a progressive solution, a democratic solution, hope, and dignity for the future of all generations, all Greeks, and all regions on June 25. This is what we have always been: the movement that genuinely embraces the anxieties, the real anxieties of the Greek people. Friends, we have a duty to reverse the current situation, which is far from what Thessaloniki deserves.

In order to conceal its indifference towards the city, New Democracy announces and takes credit for projects that are already being carried out by the local government or even by private individuals. This is Mr. Mitsotakis' desperation. He urges people to count the projects that the government will undertake, while ignoring the daily struggles of local governments and private citizens in their efforts to improve the city.

We must finally emphasize all the needs of Thessaloniki, such as the metro and its connection to the airport and the western districts, where the largest young population of the city resides, and one of the largest in our country. Emphasis should be placed on constructing new schools and health centers in the city, as well as flood protection projects, the absence of which was evident in the summer storm two days ago that caused a lot of damage. The time has come to utilize inactive camps within the urban fabric to give breathing space to densely populated areas.

And, of course, to solve the major problem that goes by the name of urban transport and which for many years the situation has remained unacceptable. A permanently problematic OASΘ without vehicles and drivers that cannot cope with the transport work and the city's transport load.

Friends, I cannot conclude without addressing what has been happening in Thrace in recent days. The PASOK party, a patriotic movement, has always been committed to addressing issues that concern the people, their perspectives, and our national interests.

But in the last few days, we have once again witnessed frivolity, unreliability, discord, and ineptitude. Both Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras must leave dangerous adventurism and electoral issues concerning the intelligence of the National Intelligence Agency out of the elections. Things are too simple for us. There must not be a member of the Greek Parliament who questions the Treaty of Lausanne, whether Christian or Muslim. No one should talk about a Muslim minority, and certainly not a Turkish minority. Anyone who challenges the Treaty of Lausanne is working against our country.

But why do we say that? Because we are the PASOK that, in 1995, broke down the barriers of shame with Andreas Papandreou. We are the PASOK that, a few years later, opened Greek universities to Greek Muslims with the 5 percent education law, resulting in a fivefold increase in the number of scientists who are Greek Muslims in Thrace 20 years later. We are the ones who have faced discrimination of all kinds in our country. That is why we are the democratic party, fighting for unity and not the division of the people.

It is not allowed to play election games on these issues. It is a disgrace for Mrs Bakoyannis, with her experience, for Mr Skirtsos, and for Mr Mitsotakis' right-hand man to threaten Greek citizens with a vocabulary of the Right from the 50s and 60s that Andreas Papandreou discarded. This vocabulary is far from any form of European acquis, gentlemen of New Democracy. It is a disgrace, no matter what mistakes our political opponents make, to talk about national exceptions. Because, gentlemen of New Democracy, you are not your country. We are all Greeks, united and not divided. The homeland belongs to all Greeks, beyond parties, religions, and social classes.

Friends, recently some people have been trying, as they did before the May 21 elections, to impose new fears about your choice. They say there is a fear of ungovernability, as if we don't see what happened on the first Sunday of 21. With the alleged scenario of an August election, they are trying to scare the younger generation, saying in essence, "vote for Mitsotakis so that he doesn't spoil your holidays." I say vote for PASOK so that New Democracy has a real opponent and so that they do not impose fear of choice. Vote so that there is no set-off, so that you do not choose on the basis of the worst not happening, but on the basis of the best hope, the best future, the best prospects. That is why there is no fear of ungovernability. There is fear of omnipotence, arrogance, impunity, corruption, and injustice. That is why we need a strong PASOK to oppose maintenance and populism in our country.

Friends, in the face of this rampant and uncontrolled New Democracy, we have a duty to promote the choice of progress, transparency, and a movement that speaks concretely without vices. We must speak realistically with consistency, prioritize a concrete program, and avoid words that cannot be put into practice.

And I say this because Mr Mitsotakis is a good man. There have been failures, yes, but Syriza was worse. When failures occur, we must choose with the best days in mind, not rely on fear to prevent the worst from happening. That is why I call on you to fight every day to build relationships of trust with the Greek people and to tear down the mechanism of fear. We must build a mechanism of hope for the best that the Greek people and our country deserve. So, friends, as we enter this new era, we will succeed together in making the Democratic Party the voice of progress and once again the protagonist. With a few days left, let us fight and on June 25th, we will be the great winners. Friends, we cannot afford four more wasted years with an ineffective opposition and an arrogant government. If PASOK is strong, there will be no four wasted years because with a real opposition in and out of parliament, New Democracy will be forced to have a real opponent to put a damper on the pathologies it is leading.

Friends, does New Democracy want to appear as a voice of responsibility? But can New Democracy be considered a voice of responsibility? How can it claim to be a voice of responsibility when it employed thousands of temporary workers, attacked independent authorities, and undermined the NHS and public education?

But the golden sponsor, Mr. Tsipras, whom New Democracy constantly uses to make offsets, also wants to forget about his dealings with Mr. Kammenos and appear as the voice of progress. Can he be the voice of progress who, three days before the last national elections, called on the allegedly misguided Golden Eagles to vote left? This is a disgrace for the leadership of SYRIZA.

That is why I call on every progressive left-winger to join us and not be held hostage by the adventurist leadership of SYRIZA.

But is it a progressive stance to promise debt relief and hand over millions of non-performing loans to funds, using the toil and sacrifice of the Greek people? Or is it truly progressive and leftist to advocate for justice everywhere, but when his closest collaborator, Mr. Pappas, is convicted by the judiciary, instead of sending him home, he has him featured on his ballot papers? This is certainly neither leftist nor progressive.

In the face of its petty partisan interests, we have a duty to show who represents progress, consistency, hope, and perspective. Therefore, PASOK is here, united and strong, as a party of responsibility. From this great rally in Thessaloniki, PASOK is sending a message that with us, there will be no more hollow words or promises. The Greek people want to leave these things behind and listen to the word of truth and progress. That is why I make a sincere promise to them here in Thessaloniki. We will move forward together, united. We will embrace your struggles, be by your side, do everything we can to address your problems, and strike a blow against vested interests because we have political autonomy. We are a people-born movement, which is why we are asking for a strong popular mandate on June 25th to take small and big decisive steps together, to make a new start, to fight for better days, with our values, principles, positions, ideas, and demands. Therefore, I call on every democrat and progressive, regardless of their past choices, to join forces on June 25th and create a strong social political majority of the modern center-left. A strong PASOK that will not vote for what must be heard, what must be said, what serves the few, but will vote and support what the country and the people owe for better days, social justice, and national dignity. This party has historically been the engine of hope and the creative forces of the country. That is why we will serve the people without regard to political cost. We will serve the people with humanity in the face of cynicism, with seriousness in the face of arrogance, with certainty in the face of uncertainty, and with responsibility in the face of unreliability. I call on you on Sunday, June 25th, to fight for the great victory, to make a decision of change, a decision of social justice and national dignity together. There are only a few days left to achieve the great goal, the goal that some years ago our political opponents considered impossible. We will achieve it on June 25th with the birth of our movement, the rebirth of the democratic party. We are putting the people back in the lead, putting the citizen, the man, the woman, the worker, the youth, and the peasant back in the lead in a strong, social, progressive movement. Together for the new great change. Be well and good luck in our struggle. PASOK here from democratic Thessaloniki sends a message of victory throughout Greece. On June 25th, we will be the great winners. On June 25th, we become again the genuine opponent of maintenance in our country. Be well, take the struggle in your hands. Raise proudly the flag of the democratic party. Thank you. Friends, yesterday from Crete and today from Thessaloniki, the message is clear. On June 25th, a new great victory for the historic social movement is coming. Be well, fight together, united, strong in this new era in which we have a duty to turn the page for the Greek people, to make our country strong and proud again. I thank you from the bottom of my heart and pledge that in this new era, we will not let any Greek woman or man down. Bless you, thank you.
