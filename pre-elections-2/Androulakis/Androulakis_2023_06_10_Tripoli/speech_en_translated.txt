Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome. Unfortunately, today the great Greek, the great Cretan, the great composer, the great democrat, Yannis Markopoulos, passed away. He was the man who expressed through his work the efforts, struggles, and visions of the Greek people.

Friends, our party has embarked on a new course, a course that leads to a battle on June 25th that we must win. We have a duty on June 25th to make this party stronger, to make changes from one end of the country to the other. We have a duty not only to make PASOK a little bigger, not only to increase our parliamentary strength, but also to rebuild the home of every democrat, of every progressive Greek. I invite all progressive people on the left, the center-left, and the center to come back and support this new effort so that there is a genuine opponent to New Democracy. In the last election on May 21st, a first step was taken. However, we still have a great deal to do, and it is our duty to do this together, all generations of the democratic party. PASOK is more united and stronger because PASOK is sending a message of victory from here, from Tripoli, from the Peloponnese. We are once again the protectors of the struggle for change, the struggle for social justice, the struggle for dignity. Our message genuinely embraces the struggles of the middle class and the most vulnerable Greeks.

But what are these anxieties? What anxieties are Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy despising? We have seen a barrage of statements in recent days regarding the national health system. Not for the first time, in the midst of the pandemic, a close associate of Mr. Mitsotakis said that the NHS and investment in it are a luxury. It is not a luxury for the state to stand by the citizen, and I pledge that PASOK will stand by every Greek woman and every Greek man. It will be the party that supports the weakest with a modern welfare state, with public health and public education. These are our principles, these are our values, and they are non-negotiable.

The programme of New Democracy, which they handed out to the Greek people in the last elections, states that the ambulance will arrive at each incident within 7 to 10 minutes. However, for 4 years they left EKAV understaffed, resulting in a shortage of 80 ambulances to reach international standards and 700 rescuers to man them, as well as the ones we already have. As a result, in the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and many parts of mainland Greece, there is barely one ambulance available round the clock. Similar problems exist in other areas of the national health system. Recently, an infant in Arcadia was in danger and had to be evacuated from Leonidio to Tripoli. According to the President of EKAB, whom I visited the day before yesterday, in order to meet our needs in Attica alone, we need 20 additional ambulances in each shift and 10 more for the night hours. The New Democracy decided in the previous government that it could afford to recruit 1,000 people for the university police, but there is no university police today; it was just another New Democracy buffoonery. However, they could not afford to take 700 rescuers to man the ambulance service, resulting in tragic events in the last few days.

Greece has only channeled 2% of the Recovery Fund resources to the National Health System and another 2% for the energy upgrade of buildings, while other countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy have allocated 8 to 11%. According to Eurostat data, the Greek people pay the third highest private health expenditure in Europe, surpassed only by Bulgaria and Lithuania. However, after a recent debate, it was discovered that Greece has now fallen to second place in this regard. PASOK aims to stop this injustice and revive the NHS, which currently suffers from understaffing and lack of resources. For example, the Panarcadian hospital in Tripoli operates with just one radiologist out of the 7 provided, leaving many on-call services uncovered. Additionally, the Papanikolaou hospital in Thessaloniki has a backlog of three and a half thousand surgeries waiting, with only 7 available anaesthetists out of 28 positions. Telemedicine infrastructure also remains inactive, which could have helped serve patients in Arcadia and beyond.

All of these examples are found throughout the country and demonstrate that PASOK's commitment to allocate 8-10% of the Recovery Fund for the regeneration of the NHS must be a commitment that all parties in Greece follow if they wish to defend the public interest.

Friends, our priority is to create a strong nationwide primary care network. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident that the absence of such a network caused significant issues in our hospitals and resulted in reduced services for serious illnesses and preventive medicine. Primary care could have acted as a barrier to the pandemic.

We are committed to raising the salaries of healthcare workers to the average of the European Union, stopping our doctors from studying here but working in Germany, and including healthcare workers in the heavy and unhealthy category to end the mockery we have been hearing for the last few years.

Friends, another topical issue has arisen in recent days with the Greek Muslims of Thrace. I actually heard Mrs Bakoyannis in a video speaking to Greek citizens in the old party clientele speech of the 1960s. We have to leave this behind if we want to become a modern European country that respects rights and treats all Greeks equally. On the other hand, the gentlemen of SYRIZA must tell us how they tolerate their executives talking about a Turkish minority in Thrace when the Treaty of Lausanne is clear, Mr Tsipras. Let me also answer the question: Why did they not pass the law on the election of the Mufti last summer?

We are the party that broke down barriers. We are the party that opened Greek universities to Greek Muslims. We are the party of European competence, respect for the rule of law, and the separation of powers. With Andreas Papandreou and Kostas Simitis, this party made it possible to have a modern region for the people without inequalities or discrimination.

Friends and comrades, we are now facing Mr. Mitsotakis' new blackmail. Will you not vote for New Democracy? It will ruin your August holidays. Be careful, this is the new blackmail. The last one was: Antonakis didn't meet me, he's rude, vote for New Democracy. You know, with these childish arguments, they think they can create new dilemmas. These dilemmas were answered by the golden sponsor of New Democracy, Mr. Tsipras, but now, Mr. Mitsotakis, it is not the golden sponsor who is facing you, but a united and strong Democratic Party, so proudly raise the green flag of PASOK. Together, we will raise the sun over our country once again.

Friends, what does the New Democracy serve? I have heard lies about our tax proposals. Why is the New Democracy so upset? Are these proposals only for 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 families? Mr. Mitsotakis's anxiety reveals who is being served by today's New Democracy. We serve the people and the country, not just 1,000 or 2,000 families who want buffers in their tax affairs and in the transfer of parental inheritances.

Friends, what are we talking about? We are simply discussing things that can change our country for the betterment of future generations. As a strong, renewed, and progressive party, it is our duty to do so. That is why our program and positions have nothing to do with the positions expressed by Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. The blackmail that you must vote for New Democracy or they will ruin your holidays and that there will be no stability is baseless, as proven by the first ballot. It is easier to have the omnipotence of 180 than 149, and with the old result and the new law, New Democracy would have had 172 seats. I say from Tripoli that just as the Greek people answered the false dilemmas of the first Sunday for PASOK, a pillar of SYRIZA and New Democracy, they should now answer the blackmailing dilemmas of Mr. Mitsotakis. There is no danger of ungovernability, only a danger of omnipotence. Therefore, vote for PASOK, vote for the democratic party, so that there can be a barrier to the arrogance of New Democracy's system of power. Even if such an issue arises, things are simple because we have a new ballot box. Mr. Mitsotakis is in government with Voridis, Georgiades, Plevris, and now Karatzaferis. Mr. Kranidiotis laid the foundations of New Democracy, which he established during the election campaign, and he too has declared his support for Mr. Mitsotakis. After picking up everyone from the far-right block of flats, let him take Velopoulos and those who sell Christianity and make a government in what New Democracy truly expresses: deep maintenance at the expense of the truly progressive people of the country that PASOK expresses.

Friends, we had Mr Tsipras with us the day before yesterday. It has been a few weeks since the May 21 election, but he still fails to acknowledge his share of responsibility for New Democracy's ratings. He blames PASOK, KKE, and simple proportional representation, but we did not have simple proportional representation in 2019, and both national and European elections had a blue map. If Stavros Arnaoutakis had not been in Crete, New Democracy would have had 13 regions. Mr Tsipras, stop talking. We are not lotus eaters; we have a memory. Who was the golden sponsor who gave New Democracy these percentages? They must pay the cost of corruption, Patsis, Tempi, and the tragedy of Tempi at the ballot box. You did not pay because you were not a credible opposition.

I didn't expect anything more from the man who backtracked on the Aegean and Prespes, claimed that the sea has no borders, and, of course, made the most provocative statement for the left-wing world, inviting them to join us in creating a strong front against the new democracy.

To the left-wing individuals whom Mr. Tsipras insulted by not voting for the amendment that would have prevented the murderers of Pavlos Fyssas from the Golden Dawn, and then a few weeks later, three days before the elections, called on the supposedly misguided members of the Golden Dawn to support SYRIZA, it is a shame, Mr. Tsipras. Here are the true progressive forces that do not despise the Left, but rather embrace it, strengthen it, and revive it once again: the movement of Andreas Papandreou.

You know, Mr. Tsipras is obsessed with fake news. He claims that I said many times in my interviews that we will not leave the country ungoverned. If a video and an interview are found where I said that, it will prove that I am wrong and that I am right, but it hasn't been said. What we were saying is that stability has a proportional responsibility, and the Greek people share that responsibility with their vote. So, Mr. Tsipras, leave the fake news and toxicity. It was this that caused you to collapse in the elections, not the KKE, PASOK, or the simple proportional representation.

Friends, Mr Tsipras wished for PASOK to form a coalition with New Democracy. Many of his executives were also hoping for this. However, they failed to comprehend that PASOK is returning to its historical tradition of being the main opponent and spokesperson for the right in the country and its conservative political choices. As a modern social democracy and centre-left party, we aim to embrace the entire political spectrum of the country and revitalize our movement. This is our strength and our goal in this new direction.

But Mr Tsipras has predetermined his course with his own choices. He brought all the members of Panos Kamenos into SYRIZA. He also brought Mr Antonaros, the right hand of Karamanlis during the bankruptcy, into Syriza. Only progressive, centre-left democrats were on the PASOK ballot papers because we started this genuine course with principles, ideas, and values that we will not negotiate with anyone. We are starting together, all generations, to fight for it, and on May 21st, after the first step, we will become even stronger again on June 25th. I understand Mr Mitsotakis's anxiety that PASOK should not grow, but here from Tripoli, let us send a message to Mr Mitsotakis himself and to the powerful media interests that constantly support him. As long as they attack PASOK, PASOK will grow stronger. There is no convenient party, only a strong and dynamic party. Your plan failed miserably with the popular verdict of the Greek people on May 21st, a people who gave us a new breath, and together we will move forward with this new breath in the coming days. That is why I say to you, take matters into your own hands. Each and every one of you should take up the cause individually to rebuild the home of every democrat in our country.

Friends, the major issue that every Greek family discusses is the economic situation. But what is the real economic situation? Is it Mr Mitsotakis' paradise narrative that everything is going well and the economy is galloping? Let us see what the OECD and the European Commission say. Because I suggest you trust them more than some people who blindly support the New Democracy. So what do they say? Have wages increased by 20%? Of course not. According to the data of both organizations, real wages have fallen by 7.4%. What else do they say? Mr Mitsotakis has loaded 50 billion of public debt onto our backs and the backs of future generations in four years. Where are all those excellent economists who informed us every day about the trade deficit, the external deficit, and the public debt during the years of the memoranda? Where are they to tell the Greek people the truth today?

So, because they have hidden, we are here to tell the Greek people the truth. Not with our own words, but with the words, documents, and data of international organizations. Greece's external deficit is the largest since 2010 this year. The answer of the New Democracy is that this is happening all over Europe because of the pandemic. Is it happening? Greece had a 12% external deficit last year, while Portugal had a 1% external deficit. This year, Greece has a 9% external deficit, while Portugal has a 1% surplus. The same is happening with other countries. I am just talking about Portugal, which is the most familiar example to us. So, instead of discussing the real situation, they are annoyed about our fiscal positions. Let us look at these positions.

What does PASOK say? Profits for businesses will remain at the same rate as today, which is 22%. Dividends up to €50,000 will remain at 5%, as it is currently. Dividends from €50,000 and above will be taxed at 10%, and those over €100,000 will be taxed at 15%. To put this into perspective, a person who receives €150,000 in dividends in one year must have shares in OTE worth one and a half million euros. These are the actual figures. The first 10% rate applies to those earning €70,000, plus an additional €1,000. Is this what New Democracy is complaining about? The extra €1,000? At €120,000, it's an additional €4,000. I don't think that's what New Democracy is complaining about. They're complaining about the 1,000 families who earn millions of euros at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable Greeks with a 5% tax rate.

But let's now turn to parental benefits. What does PASOK propose? Each parent can transfer 400,000 euros tax-free to their children in the form of mobile or real estate assets. Together, this amounts to 800,000 euros. This proposal applies to both vulnerable and middle-class families, as well as to older individuals. However, when compared to the new republic's tax-free parental benefit of 4.8 million euros on real estate, movable assets, and shares, does this proposal affect anyone in today's gathering or just 0.02% of the Greek population, Mr. Mitsotakis? This is not a storm tax, as PASOK claims, but rather tax justice for the benefit of Greek society and the strong welfare state that we must have. The figures speak for themselves. Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Greece have the lowest tax rates on dividends, as well as the worst National Health System. This demonstrates that we, as democrats and progressives, have other priorities.

Friends, New Democracy stated in a commercial that they would increase the average wage by 25%. Do you trust them? I'll tell you why you shouldn't trust them. They submitted a mid-term report to the European Commission a few weeks ago. Nowhere in the report that Mr Mitsotakis submitted does it say 25%. What it says in total is 13%, so you can understand the extent to which they despise the intelligence of the Greek people. 13% was testified, while 25% was pre-committed. But they remain unrepentant because they bankrupted Greece with the Karamanlis government. We are the party that speaks the truth and realism, and you can be sure that with this word, we will proceed with the interests of the Greek people as our only compass. Our priority is for the new generation to not expect Mr Mitsotakis's promises, but good jobs and prospects in accordance with the program of the Democratic Party. We want a normal European country where people can build a future of dignity and prospects, and not see their children emigrate without prospects.

Friends, what is our goal with taxation? Firstly, the biggest national issue for us is demography. In European countries, a family with no children and a family with two children have a tax rate difference of more than 10%. What does this mean? It means that incentives are given not only to families with three or four children, but also to families with two children. Demography is an issue that concerns the entire European Union, with an average of 10.11 in Portugal, 14 in the Czech Republic, and 15 in Ireland. In Greece, where the population is aging and villages are being abandoned, the coefficient difference is only 3 points. We will reverse this by increasing it to 10%, the European Union average, to support couples with two children and respond with significant incentives to the big issue of the demographic decline.

Friends, second priority: easing the burden of paid employment by reducing contributions. This is how we will have better wages, less undeclared work, and truly support our economy. Our second priority is not to return to the era of Syriza's incredibly high social security contributions, nor to remain in the era of New Democracy. Let's move forward by further reducing insurance contributions for the benefit of future generations and wage labor.

VAT. I hear the executives and MPs of New Democracy saying that PASOK's proposal to reduce VAT is populism. Have they forgotten their own program from 2019, which included a reduction in both the 23% and 11% rates? The gentlemen of New Democracy seem to have forgotten their own program and are now criticizing PASOK for proposing a reduction in VAT on basic goods only during the economic crisis. When Mr. Mitsotakis talks about taking 7 billion in taxes from the people's backs, he fails to mention that most of these taxes are on the backs of the powerful, with less taxes on the middle class. He hides the fact that in just four years, the Greek people have paid 7 billion in taxes, and in just two years, an additional 5 billion in indirect taxes. According to international economic theory, these indirect taxes do not affect the oligarchs, but rather the people and the middle class. Let's stop mocking any real economic theory.

Pensions. My friends, when it comes to pensions, we are talking about concrete, reliable, and affordable pensions. Our intervention amounts to one billion and 130 million. We are not referring to the thirteenth pension, which amounts to 2.7 billion. With this program, we are primarily addressing the major injustices caused by previous laws. Firstly, we are reinstating the new ESAS, which Mr Tsipras abolished for 350,000 low-income pensioners who are in a desperate situation. Secondly, we are abolishing the personal difference from 1/01/24. Thirdly, we are eliminating the unfair provisions regarding disability and old-age pensions. All of this amounts to one billion and 130 million.

And, of course, for the public sector, there should be an increase of one billion and 200 million to bring us up to the level of inflation and not to further reduce the number of civil servants, as all figures from international organizations show.

Friends, in education, we are not arguing or shading the base 10 because there will always be a base 10. Instead, we are solving the problem of education by shifting the center of gravity from private and tutorial education, which can be costly for families, to public schools with a national baccalaureate, as seen in most European countries. This will allow for a stress-free approach to exams, with a two-year timeframe for corrections and decision-making regarding university and life choices. Additionally, we are creating special education infrastructure based on the model of European countries to promote inclusion and support families with children on the autism spectrum who may struggle to cope. This is what a normal European country should provide - a strong state for all Greeks and citizens.

Friends and acquaintances. Private debt. You know very well that some people said they would cause earthquakes. They were telling the Greek people not to pay. We will come in a few months and we will cause earthquakes. These are the same people who, in 2015, SYRIZA-ANEL sold billions of non-performing loans of producers, cooperatives, and families to funds and vultures, blackmailing the Greek economy today.

What do we say? First, all parties must pass two laws as soon as Parliament opens. The first one will concern the universal protection of the main residence for over-indebted households, updating the 2010 PASOK law. The second law will concern the universal protection of agricultural land so that we do not have a de-oilization of the properties of the Greek people and our agriculture. Within this, there should be a framework of rules for the negotiation of the borrower with the creditors of the funds so that the priority is the regulations and not the extermination of the borrower. They were here not to support the economy but to speculate on our backs and go on to destroy another country afterwards. This patriotic movement is standing in the way of blackmail and standing in the way of the graft of the Greek economy.

Finally, we offer incentives to punctual borrowers to reduce the banks' profit margin on their interest rates. We have proposals for a second chance of dignity for those who did not succeed, but we also provide prospects and support for those who did succeed so that there is justice for all Greeks. Regarding the 120 installments, Mr. Mitsotakis mentioned them, but I invite you to take a walk through the shops in Tripoli on Monday morning and ask how many people have joined the 120 installments. You will understand that he has contempt for the Greek people. We propose 120 installments for the tax office and for everyone, without exception, to ensure liquidity in the Greek economy.

Friends, closing the demographic issues, I cannot fail to mention the Greek mother. I pledge here from Tripoli to every Greek mother that no child with a strong PASOK will be left out of a crèche and a creative employment centre. Also, as we tabled an amendment in Parliament a few months ago, we will table it again when Parliament opens to increase the maternity allowance for women freelancers. For us, demographics is the biggest national issue, and we will do everything we can to address it for the benefit of our nation, for the benefit of our country.

Friends, I cannot ignore the huge agricultural production throughout the Peloponnese, not to mention the Greek farmers, here in Arcadia, the heart of the Peloponnese. This party gave dignity, competitiveness, hope, and prospects to those in the 1980s. Blood is not water, and I call on our peasantry to come back and embrace the effort. We prioritize a productive and outward-looking Greece. But what have the governments of recent years achieved? In the last decade, Greece has had 260,000 fewer farmers, and arable land has decreased by about 6.5 million hectares. 1.3 billion in agricultural income was lost, and 70% of our farmers have debts to public funds in EFKA and banks. What do we propose? Measures to reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs, and zero excise duty on agricultural oil for the duration of the energy crisis.

But that's not enough. The crisis will stop, but the energy problem will remain a problem. Our priority is to give connection terms not to the powerful 5 to do photovoltaic and all renewable energy parks, but to our producers, cooperatives, processors, municipalities, and communities to democratize production. Renewable energy has fixed production costs over the next 15 years, as is the case all over Europe. Why doesn't Greece do it? Because it had two governments. One of Mr. Tsipras' governments prioritized high dependence on gas, and the other of Mr. Mitsotakis distributed RES to the powerful. We are talking about a new era of a normal European strategy that will be about smooth delignification. What does smooth delignification mean? Since we are opening up this issue, not delignification for the benefit of gas. One is our own fuel. The other is imported fuel. It also means energy dependence of the country beyond the cost of production and beyond the cost of living.

What do we say? We are fully linking delignification and its pace with investment in infrastructure, network, and storage so that, as long as lignite is stopped, the country's dependence on foreign fuels is not taken by small communities for the benefit of all the Greek people in order to make a just and real transition that will make our country energy self-sufficient and not energy-dependent. And this is a patriotic plan that makes Greece a strong country in the Eastern Mediterranean and not a dependent country as it is today, and this was also proven in the past months with the energy crisis when billions of euros from your pockets were given to some people to get subsidies. Those who do not want us to tax their excess profits. We will tax their excess profits and those of the banks because they cannot triple their profits while the Greek people are being impoverished.

Finally, for farmers, we want the ELGA insurance regulation to be updated. It is unthinkable that, at a time when climate change is escalating and we have natural phenomena that multiply the destruction of our country's livestock and plant capital, ELGA has not been adapted to ensure rapid compensation payments. Finally, the whole process for the common agricultural policy programmes should be completed within one year to stop the bureaucracy and the hostage-taking of the Greek farmer.

Friends, however, apart from the issues of a fair transition, we must discuss the issues of district heating because we cannot fail to support regions such as Western Macedonia and the Peloponnese, especially Megalopolis, which are affected by the issue of deflagration. We need to build new and modern models of growth production so that the populations in these regions can have access to drinking water, prospects, and not destroy a large part of society by driving children away due to unemployment and devaluing their prospects. Therefore, for us, district heating is also a tool for social justice.

Friends, I want to tell you from Arcadia that in this great effort that we are making, we must fight together. We must fight united, and I do not expect anyone to stand above the Greek people. We have no dependencies. Our political autonomy is a jewel of the new era. We do not expect anyone powerful to back us, but we do expect the support of the Greek people because the voice of PASOK will be the genuine voice of the Greek people both in and out of Parliament. That is why I pledge that in this new course, we will not disappoint anyone who trusts us on 25 June. I pledge that our political ethos will determine our choices. I pledge that what we said during the election will be the steps we take after the election because my priority is to build a relationship of trust, personally and collectively, with each and every one of you individually and especially with your children and grandchildren. I aspire once again for PASOK to become the party of the new generation of our country, and I am very happy that on 21 May, we doubled our share of the younger generations. That is why, in this new course, our party is investing in the word of concrete, realism, and progress. A strong PASOK will have a strong opposition in our country. A strong PASOK will be a bulwark against the uncontrollability of the government. A strong PASOK will be a bulwark against serving powerful interests. A strong PASOK will be a barrier to discord and toxicity because this party unites the Greek people in a modern project that makes Greece a normal European state, a state of law, a state of separation of powers.

But what did the others offer in terms of political ethics and trust? One protected his environment and himself in the incredible wiretapping scandal that took us back decades. The other protected his closest associate, who was convicted 13-0 by the special court. I pledge that I will never make such contemptuous choices for you and for justice, and no person will ever fit in to hurt this new course near us. Anyone who hurts the Greek people will get off the train of the democratic party, and I pledge here from Tripoli that this new course is not open to bargaining. This new course is a course of honesty, ethics, and consistency. That is why I ask you to support it.

Because we will respect your taxes. I have been President for a year and a half. We have a new leadership team and experienced individuals. However, during these months, we did not ask Mr. Mitsotakis to give 5, 10, 15, or any amount. We stated that we respect the taxes, efforts, and sacrifices of the Greek people. Therefore, we ask for only what is necessary to change the state, not what is necessary to buy the votes of the Greek people and serve powerful economic interests. This is why, if you recall, we were also deceived regarding repayable advances. They claimed that we did not want them, but we clarified that we do want them for those in need, productive enterprises, workers at risk, and the competitiveness of the economy. However, they were throwing money out like a helicopter, as shown by the Bank of Greece's figures. They do not respect your taxes or sacrifices. How else can we explain the scandal of Mr. Ragousis that New Democracy has brought to light? Mr. Mitsotakis, if you did not provide refundable advances to those who did not deserve them, an Airbnb or short-term rental of a Syriza MP would not receive a refundable advance from the taxes and sacrifices of the Greek people. These were your policies, not of fiscal rationalism, but of fiscal elitism and populism, as New Democracy did in 2007.

That is why we speak little and specifically. We respect every effort and provide perspective and hope to all Greek children and people. Therefore, I ask that on June 25th, we fight together. Victories are not given, they are won through the maximum effort of all our cadres. There is no room for complacency in the coming days. We must run together, village by village, town by town, home by home, in every workplace, to carry the message of progress, consistency, and perspective. On June 25th, I call on the Greek people to make change possible together. A decision for change with a strong PASOK across Greece. We will turn our backs on fear and division and turn hope back into the driving force of the country's creative forces. We have a duty to serve the people and the country every day, all of us together for the struggles ahead. Step by step, PASOK is reborn and becomes a movement again, so I call upon you to take the bet in your hands. A few more days.

Let's all go together to raise the sun over Greece. Let's go together to give hope and perspective. Let's go together to fight again for social justice and national dignity. Good strength and good fight. Today, Tripoli and the Peloponnese sent a message of victory to all of Greece. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. On June 25, we will celebrate the rebirth of the Democratic Party. On June 25, democracy, freedom, and social justice will become a flag of hope for all the Greek people. Bless you and good strength. Bless you! On June 25, we will raise the green flag of PASOK again. Thank you very much, be well!
