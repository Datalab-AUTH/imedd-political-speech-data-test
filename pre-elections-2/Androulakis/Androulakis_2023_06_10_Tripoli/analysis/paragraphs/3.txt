But what are these anxieties? What anxieties are Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy despising? We have seen a barrage of statements in recent days regarding the national health system. Not for the first time, in the midst of the pandemic, a close associate of Mr. Mitsotakis said that the NHS and investment in it are a luxury. It is not a luxury for the state to stand by the citizen, and I pledge that PASOK will stand by every Greek woman and every Greek man. It will be the party that supports the weakest with a modern welfare state, with public health and public education. These are our principles, these are our values, and they are non-negotiable.
