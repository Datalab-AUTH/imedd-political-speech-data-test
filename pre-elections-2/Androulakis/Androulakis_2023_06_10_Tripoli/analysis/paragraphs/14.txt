Friends, we had Mr Tsipras with us the day before yesterday. It has been a few weeks since the May 21 election, but he still fails to acknowledge his share of responsibility for New Democracy's ratings. He blames PASOK, KKE, and simple proportional representation, but we did not have simple proportional representation in 2019, and both national and European elections had a blue map. If Stavros Arnaoutakis had not been in Crete, New Democracy would have had 13 regions. Mr Tsipras, stop talking. We are not lotus eaters; we have a memory. Who was the golden sponsor who gave New Democracy these percentages? They must pay the cost of corruption, Patsis, Tempi, and the tragedy of Tempi at the ballot box. You did not pay because you were not a credible opposition.
