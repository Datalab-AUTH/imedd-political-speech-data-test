What do we say? First, all parties must pass two laws as soon as Parliament opens. The first one will concern the universal protection of the main residence for over-indebted households, updating the 2010 PASOK law. The second law will concern the universal protection of agricultural land so that we do not have a de-oilization of the properties of the Greek people and our agriculture. Within this, there should be a framework of rules for the negotiation of the borrower with the creditors of the funds so that the priority is the regulations and not the extermination of the borrower. They were here not to support the economy but to speculate on our backs and go on to destroy another country afterwards. This patriotic movement is standing in the way of blackmail and standing in the way of the graft of the Greek economy.
