Friends, what are we talking about? We are simply discussing things that can change our country for the betterment of future generations. As a strong, renewed, and progressive party, it is our duty to do so. That is why our program and positions have nothing to do with the positions expressed by Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. The blackmail that you must vote for New Democracy or they will ruin your holidays and that there will be no stability is baseless, as proven by the first ballot. It is easier to have the omnipotence of 180 than 149, and with the old result and the new law, New Democracy would have had 172 seats. I say from Tripoli that just as the Greek people answered the false dilemmas of the first Sunday for PASOK, a pillar of SYRIZA and New Democracy, they should now answer the blackmailing dilemmas of Mr. Mitsotakis. There is no danger of ungovernability, only a danger of omnipotence. Therefore, vote for PASOK, vote for the democratic party, so that there can be a barrier to the arrogance of New Democracy's system of power. Even if such an issue arises, things are simple because we have a new ballot box. Mr. Mitsotakis is in government with Voridis, Georgiades, Plevris, and now Karatzaferis. Mr. Kranidiotis laid the foundations of New Democracy, which he established during the election campaign, and he too has declared his support for Mr. Mitsotakis. After picking up everyone from the far-right block of flats, let him take Velopoulos and those who sell Christianity and make a government in what New Democracy truly expresses: deep maintenance at the expense of the truly progressive people of the country that PASOK expresses.
