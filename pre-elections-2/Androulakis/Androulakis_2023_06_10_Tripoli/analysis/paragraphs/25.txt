Friends, what is our goal with taxation? Firstly, the biggest national issue for us is demography. In European countries, a family with no children and a family with two children have a tax rate difference of more than 10%. What does this mean? It means that incentives are given not only to families with three or four children, but also to families with two children. Demography is an issue that concerns the entire European Union, with an average of 10.11 in Portugal, 14 in the Czech Republic, and 15 in Ireland. In Greece, where the population is aging and villages are being abandoned, the coefficient difference is only 3 points. We will reverse this by increasing it to 10%, the European Union average, to support couples with two children and respond with significant incentives to the big issue of the demographic decline.
