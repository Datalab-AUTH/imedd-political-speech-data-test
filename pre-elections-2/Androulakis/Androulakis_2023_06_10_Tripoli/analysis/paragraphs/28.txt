Pensions. My friends, when it comes to pensions, we are talking about concrete, reliable, and affordable pensions. Our intervention amounts to one billion and 130 million. We are not referring to the thirteenth pension, which amounts to 2.7 billion. With this program, we are primarily addressing the major injustices caused by previous laws. Firstly, we are reinstating the new ESAS, which Mr Tsipras abolished for 350,000 low-income pensioners who are in a desperate situation. Secondly, we are abolishing the personal difference from 1/01/24. Thirdly, we are eliminating the unfair provisions regarding disability and old-age pensions. All of this amounts to one billion and 130 million.
