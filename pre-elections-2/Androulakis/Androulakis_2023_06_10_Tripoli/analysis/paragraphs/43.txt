That is why we speak little and specifically. We respect every effort and provide perspective and hope to all Greek children and people. Therefore, I ask that on June 25th, we fight together. Victories are not given, they are won through the maximum effort of all our cadres. There is no room for complacency in the coming days. We must run together, village by village, town by town, home by home, in every workplace, to carry the message of progress, consistency, and perspective. On June 25th, I call on the Greek people to make change possible together. A decision for change with a strong PASOK across Greece. We will turn our backs on fear and division and turn hope back into the driving force of the country's creative forces. We have a duty to serve the people and the country every day, all of us together for the struggles ahead. Step by step, PASOK is reborn and becomes a movement again, so I call upon you to take the bet in your hands. A few more days.
