Friends, closing the demographic issues, I cannot fail to mention the Greek mother. I pledge here from Tripoli to every Greek mother that no child with a strong PASOK will be left out of a cr√®che and a creative employment centre. Also, as we tabled an amendment in Parliament a few months ago, we will table it again when Parliament opens to increase the maternity allowance for women freelancers. For us, demographics is the biggest national issue, and we will do everything we can to address it for the benefit of our nation, for the benefit of our country.
