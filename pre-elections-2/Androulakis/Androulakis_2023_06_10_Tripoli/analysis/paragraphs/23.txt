But let's now turn to parental benefits. What does PASOK propose? Each parent can transfer 400,000 euros tax-free to their children in the form of mobile or real estate assets. Together, this amounts to 800,000 euros. This proposal applies to both vulnerable and middle-class families, as well as to older individuals. However, when compared to the new republic's tax-free parental benefit of 4.8 million euros on real estate, movable assets, and shares, does this proposal affect anyone in today's gathering or just 0.02% of the Greek population, Mr. Mitsotakis? This is not a storm tax, as PASOK claims, but rather tax justice for the benefit of Greek society and the strong welfare state that we must have. The figures speak for themselves. Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Greece have the lowest tax rates on dividends, as well as the worst National Health System. This demonstrates that we, as democrats and progressives, have other priorities.
