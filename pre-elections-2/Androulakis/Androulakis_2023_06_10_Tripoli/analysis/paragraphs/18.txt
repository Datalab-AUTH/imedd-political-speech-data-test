Friends, Mr Tsipras wished for PASOK to form a coalition with New Democracy. Many of his executives were also hoping for this. However, they failed to comprehend that PASOK is returning to its historical tradition of being the main opponent and spokesperson for the right in the country and its conservative political choices. As a modern social democracy and centre-left party, we aim to embrace the entire political spectrum of the country and revitalize our movement. This is our strength and our goal in this new direction.
