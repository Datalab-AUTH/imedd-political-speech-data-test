What do we say? We are fully linking delignification and its pace with investment in infrastructure, network, and storage so that, as long as lignite is stopped, the country's dependence on foreign fuels is not taken by small communities for the benefit of all the Greek people in order to make a just and real transition that will make our country energy self-sufficient and not energy-dependent. And this is a patriotic plan that makes Greece a strong country in the Eastern Mediterranean and not a dependent country as it is today, and this was also proven in the past months with the energy crisis when billions of euros from your pockets were given to some people to get subsidies. Those who do not want us to tax their excess profits. We will tax their excess profits and those of the banks because they cannot triple their profits while the Greek people are being impoverished.
