Friends, another topical issue has arisen in recent days with the Greek Muslims of Thrace. I actually heard Mrs Bakoyannis in a video speaking to Greek citizens in the old party clientele speech of the 1960s. We have to leave this behind if we want to become a modern European country that respects rights and treats all Greeks equally. On the other hand, the gentlemen of SYRIZA must tell us how they tolerate their executives talking about a Turkish minority in Thrace when the Treaty of Lausanne is clear, Mr Tsipras. Let me also answer the question: Why did they not pass the law on the election of the Mufti last summer?
