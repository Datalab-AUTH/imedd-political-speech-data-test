We are the party that broke down barriers. We are the party that opened Greek universities to Greek Muslims. We are the party of European competence, respect for the rule of law, and the separation of powers. With Andreas Papandreou and Kostas Simitis, this party made it possible to have a modern region for the people without inequalities or discrimination.
