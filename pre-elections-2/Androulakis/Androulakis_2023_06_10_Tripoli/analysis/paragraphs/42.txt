Because we will respect your taxes. I have been President for a year and a half. We have a new leadership team and experienced individuals. However, during these months, we did not ask Mr. Mitsotakis to give 5, 10, 15, or any amount. We stated that we respect the taxes, efforts, and sacrifices of the Greek people. Therefore, we ask for only what is necessary to change the state, not what is necessary to buy the votes of the Greek people and serve powerful economic interests. This is why, if you recall, we were also deceived regarding repayable advances. They claimed that we did not want them, but we clarified that we do want them for those in need, productive enterprises, workers at risk, and the competitiveness of the economy. However, they were throwing money out like a helicopter, as shown by the Bank of Greece's figures. They do not respect your taxes or sacrifices. How else can we explain the scandal of Mr. Ragousis that New Democracy has brought to light? Mr. Mitsotakis, if you did not provide refundable advances to those who did not deserve them, an Airbnb or short-term rental of a Syriza MP would not receive a refundable advance from the taxes and sacrifices of the Greek people. These were your policies, not of fiscal rationalism, but of fiscal elitism and populism, as New Democracy did in 2007.
