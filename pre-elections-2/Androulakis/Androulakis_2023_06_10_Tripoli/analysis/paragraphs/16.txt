To the left-wing individuals whom Mr. Tsipras insulted by not voting for the amendment that would have prevented the murderers of Pavlos Fyssas from the Golden Dawn, and then a few weeks later, three days before the elections, called on the supposedly misguided members of the Golden Dawn to support SYRIZA, it is a shame, Mr. Tsipras. Here are the true progressive forces that do not despise the Left, but rather embrace it, strengthen it, and revive it once again: the movement of Andreas Papandreou.
