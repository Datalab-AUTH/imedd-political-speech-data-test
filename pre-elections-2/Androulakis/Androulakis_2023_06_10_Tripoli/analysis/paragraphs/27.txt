VAT. I hear the executives and MPs of New Democracy saying that PASOK's proposal to reduce VAT is populism. Have they forgotten their own program from 2019, which included a reduction in both the 23% and 11% rates? The gentlemen of New Democracy seem to have forgotten their own program and are now criticizing PASOK for proposing a reduction in VAT on basic goods only during the economic crisis. When Mr. Mitsotakis talks about taking 7 billion in taxes from the people's backs, he fails to mention that most of these taxes are on the backs of the powerful, with less taxes on the middle class. He hides the fact that in just four years, the Greek people have paid 7 billion in taxes, and in just two years, an additional 5 billion in indirect taxes. According to international economic theory, these indirect taxes do not affect the oligarchs, but rather the people and the middle class. Let's stop mocking any real economic theory.
