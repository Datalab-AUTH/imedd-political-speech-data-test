But what did the others offer in terms of political ethics and trust? One protected his environment and himself in the incredible wiretapping scandal that took us back decades. The other protected his closest associate, who was convicted 13-0 by the special court. I pledge that I will never make such contemptuous choices for you and for justice, and no person will ever fit in to hurt this new course near us. Anyone who hurts the Greek people will get off the train of the democratic party, and I pledge here from Tripoli that this new course is not open to bargaining. This new course is a course of honesty, ethics, and consistency. That is why I ask you to support it.
