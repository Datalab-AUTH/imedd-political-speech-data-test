Friends, the major issue that every Greek family discusses is the economic situation. But what is the real economic situation? Is it Mr Mitsotakis' paradise narrative that everything is going well and the economy is galloping? Let us see what the OECD and the European Commission say. Because I suggest you trust them more than some people who blindly support the New Democracy. So what do they say? Have wages increased by 20%? Of course not. According to the data of both organizations, real wages have fallen by 7.4%. What else do they say? Mr Mitsotakis has loaded 50 billion of public debt onto our backs and the backs of future generations in four years. Where are all those excellent economists who informed us every day about the trade deficit, the external deficit, and the public debt during the years of the memoranda? Where are they to tell the Greek people the truth today?
