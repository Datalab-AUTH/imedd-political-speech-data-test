You know, Mr. Tsipras is obsessed with fake news. He claims that I said many times in my interviews that we will not leave the country ungoverned. If a video and an interview are found where I said that, it will prove that I am wrong and that I am right, but it hasn't been said. What we were saying is that stability has a proportional responsibility, and the Greek people share that responsibility with their vote. So, Mr. Tsipras, leave the fake news and toxicity. It was this that caused you to collapse in the elections, not the KKE, PASOK, or the simple proportional representation.
