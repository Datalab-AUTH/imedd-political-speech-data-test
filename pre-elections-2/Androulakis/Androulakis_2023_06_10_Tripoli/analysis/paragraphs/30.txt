Friends, in education, we are not arguing or shading the base 10 because there will always be a base 10. Instead, we are solving the problem of education by shifting the center of gravity from private and tutorial education, which can be costly for families, to public schools with a national baccalaureate, as seen in most European countries. This will allow for a stress-free approach to exams, with a two-year timeframe for corrections and decision-making regarding university and life choices. Additionally, we are creating special education infrastructure based on the model of European countries to promote inclusion and support families with children on the autism spectrum who may struggle to cope. This is what a normal European country should provide - a strong state for all Greeks and citizens.
