What does PASOK say? Profits for businesses will remain at the same rate as today, which is 22%. Dividends up to €50,000 will remain at 5%, as it is currently. Dividends from €50,000 and above will be taxed at 10%, and those over €100,000 will be taxed at 15%. To put this into perspective, a person who receives €150,000 in dividends in one year must have shares in OTE worth one and a half million euros. These are the actual figures. The first 10% rate applies to those earning €70,000, plus an additional €1,000. Is this what New Democracy is complaining about? The extra €1,000? At €120,000, it's an additional €4,000. I don't think that's what New Democracy is complaining about. They're complaining about the 1,000 families who earn millions of euros at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable Greeks with a 5% tax rate.
