Friends, I cannot ignore the huge agricultural production throughout the Peloponnese, not to mention the Greek farmers, here in Arcadia, the heart of the Peloponnese. This party gave dignity, competitiveness, hope, and prospects to those in the 1980s. Blood is not water, and I call on our peasantry to come back and embrace the effort. We prioritize a productive and outward-looking Greece. But what have the governments of recent years achieved? In the last decade, Greece has had 260,000 fewer farmers, and arable land has decreased by about 6.5 million hectares. 1.3 billion in agricultural income was lost, and 70% of our farmers have debts to public funds in EFKA and banks. What do we propose? Measures to reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs, and zero excise duty on agricultural oil for the duration of the energy crisis.
