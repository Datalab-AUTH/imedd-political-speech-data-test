Friends, however, apart from the issues of a fair transition, we must discuss the issues of district heating because we cannot fail to support regions such as Western Macedonia and the Peloponnese, especially Megalopolis, which are affected by the issue of deflagration. We need to build new and modern models of growth production so that the populations in these regions can have access to drinking water, prospects, and not destroy a large part of society by driving children away due to unemployment and devaluing their prospects. Therefore, for us, district heating is also a tool for social justice.
