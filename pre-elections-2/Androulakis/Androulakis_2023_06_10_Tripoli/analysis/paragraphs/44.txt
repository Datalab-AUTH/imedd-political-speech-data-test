Let's all go together to raise the sun over Greece. Let's go together to give hope and perspective. Let's go together to fight again for social justice and national dignity. Good strength and good fight. Today, Tripoli and the Peloponnese sent a message of victory to all of Greece. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. On June 25, we will celebrate the rebirth of the Democratic Party. On June 25, democracy, freedom, and social justice will become a flag of hope for all the Greek people. Bless you and good strength. Bless you! On June 25, we will raise the green flag of PASOK again. Thank you very much, be well!
