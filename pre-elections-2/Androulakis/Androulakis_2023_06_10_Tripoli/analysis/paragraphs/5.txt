Greece has only channeled 2% of the Recovery Fund resources to the National Health System and another 2% for the energy upgrade of buildings, while other countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy have allocated 8 to 11%. According to Eurostat data, the Greek people pay the third highest private health expenditure in Europe, surpassed only by Bulgaria and Lithuania. However, after a recent debate, it was discovered that Greece has now fallen to second place in this regard. PASOK aims to stop this injustice and revive the NHS, which currently suffers from understaffing and lack of resources. For example, the Panarcadian hospital in Tripoli operates with just one radiologist out of the 7 provided, leaving many on-call services uncovered. Additionally, the Papanikolaou hospital in Thessaloniki has a backlog of three and a half thousand surgeries waiting, with only 7 available anaesthetists out of 28 positions. Telemedicine infrastructure also remains inactive, which could have helped serve patients in Arcadia and beyond.
