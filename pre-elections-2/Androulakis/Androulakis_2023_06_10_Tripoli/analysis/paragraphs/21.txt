So, because they have hidden, we are here to tell the Greek people the truth. Not with our own words, but with the words, documents, and data of international organizations. Greece's external deficit is the largest since 2010 this year. The answer of the New Democracy is that this is happening all over Europe because of the pandemic. Is it happening? Greece had a 12% external deficit last year, while Portugal had a 1% external deficit. This year, Greece has a 9% external deficit, while Portugal has a 1% surplus. The same is happening with other countries. I am just talking about Portugal, which is the most familiar example to us. So, instead of discussing the real situation, they are annoyed about our fiscal positions. Let us look at these positions.
