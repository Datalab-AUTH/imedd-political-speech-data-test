Friends, I want to tell you from Arcadia that in this great effort that we are making, we must fight together. We must fight united, and I do not expect anyone to stand above the Greek people. We have no dependencies. Our political autonomy is a jewel of the new era. We do not expect anyone powerful to back us, but we do expect the support of the Greek people because the voice of PASOK will be the genuine voice of the Greek people both in and out of Parliament. That is why I pledge that in this new course, we will not disappoint anyone who trusts us on 25 June. I pledge that our political ethos will determine our choices. I pledge that what we said during the election will be the steps we take after the election because my priority is to build a relationship of trust, personally and collectively, with each and every one of you individually and especially with your children and grandchildren. I aspire once again for PASOK to become the party of the new generation of our country, and I am very happy that on 21 May, we doubled our share of the younger generations. That is why, in this new course, our party is investing in the word of concrete, realism, and progress. A strong PASOK will have a strong opposition in our country. A strong PASOK will be a bulwark against the uncontrollability of the government. A strong PASOK will be a bulwark against serving powerful interests. A strong PASOK will be a barrier to discord and toxicity because this party unites the Greek people in a modern project that makes Greece a normal European state, a state of law, a state of separation of powers.
