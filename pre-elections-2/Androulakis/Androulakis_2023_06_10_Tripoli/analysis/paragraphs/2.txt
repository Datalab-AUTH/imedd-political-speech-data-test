Friends, our party has embarked on a new course, a course that leads to a battle on June 25th that we must win. We have a duty on June 25th to make this party stronger, to make changes from one end of the country to the other. We have a duty not only to make PASOK a little bigger, not only to increase our parliamentary strength, but also to rebuild the home of every democrat, of every progressive Greek. I invite all progressive people on the left, the center-left, and the center to come back and support this new effort so that there is a genuine opponent to New Democracy. In the last election on May 21st, a first step was taken. However, we still have a great deal to do, and it is our duty to do this together, all generations of the democratic party. PASOK is more united and stronger because PASOK is sending a message of victory from here, from Tripoli, from the Peloponnese. We are once again the protectors of the struggle for change, the struggle for social justice, the struggle for dignity. Our message genuinely embraces the struggles of the middle class and the most vulnerable Greeks.
