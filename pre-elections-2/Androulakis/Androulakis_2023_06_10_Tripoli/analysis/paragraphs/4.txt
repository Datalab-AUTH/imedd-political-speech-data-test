The programme of New Democracy, which they handed out to the Greek people in the last elections, states that the ambulance will arrive at each incident within 7 to 10 minutes. However, for 4 years they left EKAV understaffed, resulting in a shortage of 80 ambulances to reach international standards and 700 rescuers to man them, as well as the ones we already have. As a result, in the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and many parts of mainland Greece, there is barely one ambulance available round the clock. Similar problems exist in other areas of the national health system. Recently, an infant in Arcadia was in danger and had to be evacuated from Leonidio to Tripoli. According to the President of EKAB, whom I visited the day before yesterday, in order to meet our needs in Attica alone, we need 20 additional ambulances in each shift and 10 more for the night hours. The New Democracy decided in the previous government that it could afford to recruit 1,000 people for the university police, but there is no university police today; it was just another New Democracy buffoonery. However, they could not afford to take 700 rescuers to man the ambulance service, resulting in tragic events in the last few days.
