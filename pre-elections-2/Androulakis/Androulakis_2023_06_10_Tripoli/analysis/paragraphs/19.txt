But Mr Tsipras has predetermined his course with his own choices. He brought all the members of Panos Kamenos into SYRIZA. He also brought Mr Antonaros, the right hand of Karamanlis during the bankruptcy, into Syriza. Only progressive, centre-left democrats were on the PASOK ballot papers because we started this genuine course with principles, ideas, and values that we will not negotiate with anyone. We are starting together, all generations, to fight for it, and on May 21st, after the first step, we will become even stronger again on June 25th. I understand Mr Mitsotakis's anxiety that PASOK should not grow, but here from Tripoli, let us send a message to Mr Mitsotakis himself and to the powerful media interests that constantly support him. As long as they attack PASOK, PASOK will grow stronger. There is no convenient party, only a strong and dynamic party. Your plan failed miserably with the popular verdict of the Greek people on May 21st, a people who gave us a new breath, and together we will move forward with this new breath in the coming days. That is why I say to you, take matters into your own hands. Each and every one of you should take up the cause individually to rebuild the home of every democrat in our country.
