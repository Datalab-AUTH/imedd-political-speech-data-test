Friends, New Democracy stated in a commercial that they would increase the average wage by 25%. Do you trust them? I'll tell you why you shouldn't trust them. They submitted a mid-term report to the European Commission a few weeks ago. Nowhere in the report that Mr Mitsotakis submitted does it say 25%. What it says in total is 13%, so you can understand the extent to which they despise the intelligence of the Greek people. 13% was testified, while 25% was pre-committed. But they remain unrepentant because they bankrupted Greece with the Karamanlis government. We are the party that speaks the truth and realism, and you can be sure that with this word, we will proceed with the interests of the Greek people as our only compass. Our priority is for the new generation to not expect Mr Mitsotakis's promises, but good jobs and prospects in accordance with the program of the Democratic Party. We want a normal European country where people can build a future of dignity and prospects, and not see their children emigrate without prospects.
