Friends and comrades, we are now facing Mr. Mitsotakis' new blackmail. Will you not vote for New Democracy? It will ruin your August holidays. Be careful, this is the new blackmail. The last one was: Antonakis didn't meet me, he's rude, vote for New Democracy. You know, with these childish arguments, they think they can create new dilemmas. These dilemmas were answered by the golden sponsor of New Democracy, Mr. Tsipras, but now, Mr. Mitsotakis, it is not the golden sponsor who is facing you, but a united and strong Democratic Party, so proudly raise the green flag of PASOK. Together, we will raise the sun over our country once again.
