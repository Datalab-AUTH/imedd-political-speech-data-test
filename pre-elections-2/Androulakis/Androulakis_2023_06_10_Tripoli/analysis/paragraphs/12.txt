Friends, what does the New Democracy serve? I have heard lies about our tax proposals. Why is the New Democracy so upset? Are these proposals only for 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 families? Mr. Mitsotakis's anxiety reveals who is being served by today's New Democracy. We serve the people and the country, not just 1,000 or 2,000 families who want buffers in their tax affairs and in the transfer of parental inheritances.
