Friends, second priority: easing the burden of paid employment by reducing contributions. This is how we will have better wages, less undeclared work, and truly support our economy. Our second priority is not to return to the era of Syriza's incredibly high social security contributions, nor to remain in the era of New Democracy. Let's move forward by further reducing insurance contributions for the benefit of future generations and wage labor.
