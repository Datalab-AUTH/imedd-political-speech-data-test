But that's not enough. The crisis will stop, but the energy problem will remain a problem. Our priority is to give connection terms not to the powerful 5 to do photovoltaic and all renewable energy parks, but to our producers, cooperatives, processors, municipalities, and communities to democratize production. Renewable energy has fixed production costs over the next 15 years, as is the case all over Europe. Why doesn't Greece do it? Because it had two governments. One of Mr. Tsipras' governments prioritized high dependence on gas, and the other of Mr. Mitsotakis distributed RES to the powerful. We are talking about a new era of a normal European strategy that will be about smooth delignification. What does smooth delignification mean? Since we are opening up this issue, not delignification for the benefit of gas. One is our own fuel. The other is imported fuel. It also means energy dependence of the country beyond the cost of production and beyond the cost of living.
