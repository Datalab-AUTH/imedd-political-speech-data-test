We are addressing demography. We support families by providing nurseries for all children and reducing tax rates for families with two or more children to bring them closer to the European average. In our country, the difference in tax rates between a family with two children and a family with no children cannot exceed 3%, while in other countries facing similar issues, the difference is between 10 and 20 percentage points.
