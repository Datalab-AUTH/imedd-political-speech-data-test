Our priority is the struggle for a strong homeland and a strong democracy. That is why the party that stands on the shore of progress and responsibility is PASOK, and it is here, united and strong. That is why I say to every progressive citizen, stop the hostage-taking by the "golden" sponsor of Mr Mitsotakis, the leadership team of SYRIZA. I appeal to every democrat and progressive citizen. Let us come together to revive the democratic party. We don't have to live for four years with the same: an ineffective opposition and an arrogant clientelist authoritarian government, setting off SYRIZA's past failures against its past. We say so far. PASOK, loudly on June 25th. End the fear mechanism, end this toxic dichotomy that divides, does not unite, does not give perspective, and condemns the country to be a country of low priorities and opportunities.
