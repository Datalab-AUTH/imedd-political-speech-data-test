At this crucial political crossroads, we are here to extend an invitation to every democrat, progressive citizen, regardless of the party they voted for on the first Sunday of May 21st. May our struggles and hopes meet, to join forces and become the strong majority movement that will express the citizens' desire for a better future. Let us fight together to defend the quality of democracy, strengthen the rule of law, and protect the interests of the great majority of the Greek people, from whom the great democratic progressive party has always drawn strength, allowing it to play a leading role in the political life of the post-independence period and change the country. It is to this majority that I am addressing today, here in Athens. Come together to make a new beginning, a new course. This is PASOK's battle. It is the battle for a strong, modern center-left in our country, not the golden sponsor of New Democracy. It is the battle on June 25th to have a strong, credible opposition. For there to be a strong opponent of conservation, a strong opponent of the New Democracy government. So come to this new march, every democrat, every progressive citizen. On May 21st, we took the first step. PASOK has increased its forces more than any other party in the country. It now remains to take the next big step, to make our democratic progressive movement even stronger. Our only goal is to pave the way for the emergence of the modern center-left as the real alternative to governance, so that the citizen knows that they will not decide based on fear of the worst, but with a strong PASOK for the hope of better days. We have a duty on June 25th to fill the dangerous political vacuum created by the double failure of SYRIZA. The first failure to govern successfully and the second failure to provide effective opposition. So that is why we must fight to express a majority of democratic, progressive Greeks. A daily struggle. Only a few days left for the great victory.
