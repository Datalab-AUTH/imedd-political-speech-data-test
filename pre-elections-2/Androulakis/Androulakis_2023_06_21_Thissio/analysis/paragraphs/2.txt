We have a duty to overturn the correlations that have divided our people, frustrated them, and trapped them in a dichotomy of toxic confrontations between two systems of power that have failed to improve people's lives in any meaningful way. They have plunged society into an unprecedented crisis of confidence in the political system. That is why our first duty is to build a new relationship of trust with our words and actions. Every day, we must speak responsibly, credibly, and genuinely progress with every citizen. Friends, despite New Democracy's systematic attempts to embellish the situation, the years ahead are crucial for the country. What is important is to avoid making fatal mistakes for social cohesion, the quality of life, and the everyday life of citizens. We must not lead to an explosion in precision and social inequalities that affect the middle classes and the most vulnerable social groups.
