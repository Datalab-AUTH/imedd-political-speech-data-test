We are advocating for institutional and substantive measures that protect households by reducing taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, and implementing effective market controls to reduce production costs for our farmers. Our first concern is for those outside the walls who should not be abandoned to despair and desperation. They should feel that we are there for them and that we care so that they can live with dignity and prospects.
