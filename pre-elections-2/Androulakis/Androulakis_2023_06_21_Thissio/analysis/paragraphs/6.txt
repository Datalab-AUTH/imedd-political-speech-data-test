Is it responsible for "Patsy's" to speculate on the hardships of borrowers? Did the wiretapping scandal expose the country internationally? None of these are examples of responsibility. They are examples of authoritarianism, clientelism, and undignified government. We have a duty to stand up to everything that undermines the people and the country.
