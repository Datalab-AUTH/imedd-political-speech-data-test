Friends and colleagues, New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis have the audacity to accuse the party that established ASEP, Transparency, and open government of partisanship and old-style politics. We pledge to ensure transparency in all decisions, merit-based recruitment, the empowerment of independent authorities, and the depoliticization of the state by selecting the leadership of organizations and hospitals through an open international competition and a five-year term of service.
