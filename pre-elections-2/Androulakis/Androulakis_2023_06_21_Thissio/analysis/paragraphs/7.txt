My friends, SYRIZA claims that it is on the side of progress. However, is it progressive to adopt the slogan "Justice everywhere" during the election campaign, but to have a close associate of Mr. Tsipras, Mr. Pappas, on their ballot papers despite his 13-0 conviction by the Special Court? But the worst thing about Mr. Tsipras, people of Athens, are his statements just before the first national elections when he called for the allegedly "misguided" voters of Golden Dawn to vote for SYRIZA, revealing why he did not vote for the amendment that prevented the neo-Nazi murderers of Pavlos Fyssas from voting in the elections. This shows that they have no compass for progressive ideas and values. Their only priority is the chair and power.
