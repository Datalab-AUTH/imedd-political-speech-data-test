My friends, Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis are competing in arrogance and conceit. Mr Tsipras claims that anyone who does not vote for Syriza is essentially voting for New Democracy. He has failed to realize that people have recognized that by voting for Syriza, they are essentially supporting the 'golden' sponsor of New Democracy. And of course, there is also the arrogance of Mr Mitsotakis, who claims that he will be both the government and opposition to himself. With your vote, put an end to these ludicrous attitudes.
