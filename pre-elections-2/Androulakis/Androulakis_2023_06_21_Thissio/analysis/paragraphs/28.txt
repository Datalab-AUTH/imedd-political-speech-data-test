We are not, therefore, the "cops" of European decisions. We want Greece to be a protagonist, a co-shaper in the great changes for a Europe of peoples and solidarity, not the Europe of powerful economic interests. This is what we are fighting for: the creation of permanent common financial instruments that will support the productive base of European countries, especially those in the South. We also want a revision of the Dublin III Regulation, so that the burden does not fall only on the host countries, with a real and permanent relocation mechanism. We reject the Council proposal that New Democracy was celebrating, which provides for only 30,000 relocations, while 960,000 asylum applications were submitted last year alone. Additionally, we support a common foreign and defense policy with the creation of a European army to protect the European borders from Finland and Estonia to Greece and Cyprus. As long as Turkey continues to violate international law and our sovereign rights, our European partners cannot be allowed to continue to arm Turkey. This is solidarity in action, not just words.
