People of Athens, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your overwhelming presence, which sends a message of victory, optimism, and perspective to every corner of the country. PASOK is here, united, strong, with the people at the forefront. PASOK is here, united, strong, to serve the homeland, the new generation, for better days, social justice, and national dignity. Friends, next Sunday we have a decisive battle ahead of us. On June 25, the real opponent of New Democracy will be reborn. PASOK will be the force that will send Mr Mitsotakis into opposition. We will again become, step by step, the majority current in Greek society. This is our sole objective. The battle next Sunday is crucial for the country, society, and the economy. The people have not forgotten about maintenance, undignified, opaque, and client state. We have a duty to fight and make Greece a normal European country. Friends, in this new era, in every village, in every town, door to door, neighborhood to neighborhood, we will fight until victory on 25 June.
