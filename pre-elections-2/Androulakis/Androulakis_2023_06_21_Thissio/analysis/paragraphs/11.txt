From this viciousness and unreliability, you deserve more, and we are here united to offer more to the Greek people and the country. PASOK is more united now, with the aim of expressing the progressive world of the country in a dynamic, majority way on June 25th. We have days and hours of struggle ahead, and we must not abandon this patriotic effort for a moment. Friends, it is time to defend institutions, democracy, the rule of law, transparency, and the reduction of social inequalities. We have a duty to do a lot, especially for young people. There are many young people in this gathering today, and it gives me great joy to see thousands of new faces contributing to the rebirth of our Movement. These young people proudly raise the flag of the democratic party, sending a message from Athens today. What our opponents thought was impossible, we will do on June 25th. That is why I would like to take this opportunity to address young people in particular. They do not deserve to be mocked or deceived by the myth of artificial development on borrowed money. They do not deserve the embellishment of reality. It is time for the younger generation to regain its place at the forefront of the democratic party's struggle against opacity, unworthiness, and the client mentality that is mortgaging its future.
