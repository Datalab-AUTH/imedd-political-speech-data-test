We aspire to bring about real reform in education with the National Baccalaureate, the breaking of inequalities through remedial teaching, the provision of a safe school environment with psychological and social support services, and the establishment of strong special education structures. Our goal is for inclusion to become the norm in our country, which will then be recognized as a normal European country that respects every child and every family.
