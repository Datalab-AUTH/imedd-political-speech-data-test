In the face of the dead-end policies of New Democracy, we propose a Made in Greece development approach. This involves redirecting the priorities of the Recovery Fund towards a National Development Plan that promotes production. We aim to support innovative investments with added value and link tourism with the primary sector to achieve extroversion, exports, regional development, and good jobs.
