As far as public health is concerned, the situation is disheartening. We have witnessed tragic events due to shortages in the ambulance service, with 700 rescuers missing to cover shifts. Additionally, there are embarrassing waiting lists for operations. It is outrageous what I was told at Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki: 3,500 of our fellow citizens are waiting to be operated on because there are only 7 anaesthetists instead of the 28 required. We are second in the European Union in private healthcare expenditure, surpassed only by Bulgaria.
