But it's not just arrogance; it's also untrustworthiness. Mitsotakis promises a 25% increase in private sector wages in New Democracy's commercials, but in the stability programme he submitted to Brussels, he pledges increases of only 13%. As Skylakakis revealed, there is no "Messiah" to repeat the miracle of Kana and multiply wage increases. Unjustly, therefore, the executives of New Democracy in Achaia were waiting for him in the streets with bushes. He is not going to perform any miracle. He is once again unreliable and disregards the real problems of the Greek people.
