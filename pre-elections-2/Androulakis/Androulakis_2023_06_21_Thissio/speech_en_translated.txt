People of Athens, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your overwhelming presence, which sends a message of victory, optimism, and perspective to every corner of the country. PASOK is here, united, strong, with the people at the forefront. PASOK is here, united, strong, to serve the homeland, the new generation, for better days, social justice, and national dignity. Friends, next Sunday we have a decisive battle ahead of us. On June 25, the real opponent of New Democracy will be reborn. PASOK will be the force that will send Mr Mitsotakis into opposition. We will again become, step by step, the majority current in Greek society. This is our sole objective. The battle next Sunday is crucial for the country, society, and the economy. The people have not forgotten about maintenance, undignified, opaque, and client state. We have a duty to fight and make Greece a normal European country. Friends, in this new era, in every village, in every town, door to door, neighborhood to neighborhood, we will fight until victory on 25 June.

We have a duty to overturn the correlations that have divided our people, frustrated them, and trapped them in a dichotomy of toxic confrontations between two systems of power that have failed to improve people's lives in any meaningful way. They have plunged society into an unprecedented crisis of confidence in the political system. That is why our first duty is to build a new relationship of trust with our words and actions. Every day, we must speak responsibly, credibly, and genuinely progress with every citizen. Friends, despite New Democracy's systematic attempts to embellish the situation, the years ahead are crucial for the country. What is important is to avoid making fatal mistakes for social cohesion, the quality of life, and the everyday life of citizens. We must not lead to an explosion in precision and social inequalities that affect the middle classes and the most vulnerable social groups.

At this crucial political crossroads, we are here to extend an invitation to every democrat, progressive citizen, regardless of the party they voted for on the first Sunday of May 21st. May our struggles and hopes meet, to join forces and become the strong majority movement that will express the citizens' desire for a better future. Let us fight together to defend the quality of democracy, strengthen the rule of law, and protect the interests of the great majority of the Greek people, from whom the great democratic progressive party has always drawn strength, allowing it to play a leading role in the political life of the post-independence period and change the country. It is to this majority that I am addressing today, here in Athens. Come together to make a new beginning, a new course. This is PASOK's battle. It is the battle for a strong, modern center-left in our country, not the golden sponsor of New Democracy. It is the battle on June 25th to have a strong, credible opposition. For there to be a strong opponent of conservation, a strong opponent of the New Democracy government. So come to this new march, every democrat, every progressive citizen. On May 21st, we took the first step. PASOK has increased its forces more than any other party in the country. It now remains to take the next big step, to make our democratic progressive movement even stronger. Our only goal is to pave the way for the emergence of the modern center-left as the real alternative to governance, so that the citizen knows that they will not decide based on fear of the worst, but with a strong PASOK for the hope of better days. We have a duty on June 25th to fill the dangerous political vacuum created by the double failure of SYRIZA. The first failure to govern successfully and the second failure to provide effective opposition. So that is why we must fight to express a majority of democratic, progressive Greeks. A daily struggle. Only a few days left for the great victory.

Friends, New Democracy propagates that it is taking responsibility. Is it responsible to undermine the welfare state? To deliberately degrade the NHS? To devalue public education? To burden the middle class and the weakest Greeks with indirect taxation? To treat the state as the spoils of Mr. Mitsotakis, his nephew, and his nephew's gang at the Great Maximus?

No, we serve a different project of meritocracy and transparency, where the citizen is served by the state, not Maximos. This is our significant difference in values.

Is it responsible for "Patsy's" to speculate on the hardships of borrowers? Did the wiretapping scandal expose the country internationally? None of these are examples of responsibility. They are examples of authoritarianism, clientelism, and undignified government. We have a duty to stand up to everything that undermines the people and the country.

My friends, SYRIZA claims that it is on the side of progress. However, is it progressive to adopt the slogan "Justice everywhere" during the election campaign, but to have a close associate of Mr. Tsipras, Mr. Pappas, on their ballot papers despite his 13-0 conviction by the Special Court? But the worst thing about Mr. Tsipras, people of Athens, are his statements just before the first national elections when he called for the allegedly "misguided" voters of Golden Dawn to vote for SYRIZA, revealing why he did not vote for the amendment that prevented the neo-Nazi murderers of Pavlos Fyssas from voting in the elections. This shows that they have no compass for progressive ideas and values. Their only priority is the chair and power.

Our priority is the struggle for a strong homeland and a strong democracy. That is why the party that stands on the shore of progress and responsibility is PASOK, and it is here, united and strong. That is why I say to every progressive citizen, stop the hostage-taking by the "golden" sponsor of Mr Mitsotakis, the leadership team of SYRIZA. I appeal to every democrat and progressive citizen. Let us come together to revive the democratic party. We don't have to live for four years with the same: an ineffective opposition and an arrogant clientelist authoritarian government, setting off SYRIZA's past failures against its past. We say so far. PASOK, loudly on June 25th. End the fear mechanism, end this toxic dichotomy that divides, does not unite, does not give perspective, and condemns the country to be a country of low priorities and opportunities.

My friends, Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis are competing in arrogance and conceit. Mr Tsipras claims that anyone who does not vote for Syriza is essentially voting for New Democracy. He has failed to realize that people have recognized that by voting for Syriza, they are essentially supporting the 'golden' sponsor of New Democracy. And of course, there is also the arrogance of Mr Mitsotakis, who claims that he will be both the government and opposition to himself. With your vote, put an end to these ludicrous attitudes.

But it's not just arrogance; it's also untrustworthiness. Mitsotakis promises a 25% increase in private sector wages in New Democracy's commercials, but in the stability programme he submitted to Brussels, he pledges increases of only 13%. As Skylakakis revealed, there is no "Messiah" to repeat the miracle of Kana and multiply wage increases. Unjustly, therefore, the executives of New Democracy in Achaia were waiting for him in the streets with bushes. He is not going to perform any miracle. He is once again unreliable and disregards the real problems of the Greek people.

From this viciousness and unreliability, you deserve more, and we are here united to offer more to the Greek people and the country. PASOK is more united now, with the aim of expressing the progressive world of the country in a dynamic, majority way on June 25th. We have days and hours of struggle ahead, and we must not abandon this patriotic effort for a moment. Friends, it is time to defend institutions, democracy, the rule of law, transparency, and the reduction of social inequalities. We have a duty to do a lot, especially for young people. There are many young people in this gathering today, and it gives me great joy to see thousands of new faces contributing to the rebirth of our Movement. These young people proudly raise the flag of the democratic party, sending a message from Athens today. What our opponents thought was impossible, we will do on June 25th. That is why I would like to take this opportunity to address young people in particular. They do not deserve to be mocked or deceived by the myth of artificial development on borrowed money. They do not deserve the embellishment of reality. It is time for the younger generation to regain its place at the forefront of the democratic party's struggle against opacity, unworthiness, and the client mentality that is mortgaging its future.

Friends, the New Democracy government has increased public debt by 45 billion euros over four years and led to a sharp increase in the external deficit. In Greece, it was 12% last year and is set at 9.2% this year. New Democracy claims that this is happening all over Europe, but this is another rebuttal. In Portugal, the trade deficit was 1% last year and is going into a 1% surplus this year.

At the same time, it insists on directing the precious resources of the Recovery Fund mainly towards the big and powerful, leaving little for the financing of Greek small and medium enterprises and farmers.

In the face of the dead-end policies of New Democracy, we propose a Made in Greece development approach. This involves redirecting the priorities of the Recovery Fund towards a National Development Plan that promotes production. We aim to support innovative investments with added value and link tourism with the primary sector to achieve extroversion, exports, regional development, and good jobs.

In the field of price inflation, New Democracy allows speculation to inflate and pretends to address the problem with temporary measures.

We are advocating for institutional and substantive measures that protect households by reducing taxes on basic foodstuffs and fuel, and implementing effective market controls to reduce production costs for our farmers. Our first concern is for those outside the walls who should not be abandoned to despair and desperation. They should feel that we are there for them and that we care so that they can live with dignity and prospects.

Friends and colleagues, New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis have the audacity to accuse the party that established ASEP, Transparency, and open government of partisanship and old-style politics. We pledge to ensure transparency in all decisions, merit-based recruitment, the empowerment of independent authorities, and the depoliticization of the state by selecting the leadership of organizations and hospitals through an open international competition and a five-year term of service.

In the face of employers' impunity, which is reinforced by the policies of New Democracy, we promote the new regulation of labor relations through social dialogue. We aim for work with rules and security, decent wages determined through free collective bargaining, and strong control mechanisms that protect the rights of workers.

As far as public health is concerned, the situation is disheartening. We have witnessed tragic events due to shortages in the ambulance service, with 700 rescuers missing to cover shifts. Additionally, there are embarrassing waiting lists for operations. It is outrageous what I was told at Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki: 3,500 of our fellow citizens are waiting to be operated on because there are only 7 anaesthetists instead of the 28 required. We are second in the European Union in private healthcare expenditure, surpassed only by Bulgaria.

It is PASOK that founded the National Health System and can revive it with a strong primary health care system, allocation of 8-10% of the Recovery Fund resources, filling all staff vacancies with permanent recruitment, and inclusion of health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category.

We aspire to bring about real reform in education with the National Baccalaureate, the breaking of inequalities through remedial teaching, the provision of a safe school environment with psychological and social support services, and the establishment of strong special education structures. Our goal is for inclusion to become the norm in our country, which will then be recognized as a normal European country that respects every child and every family.

We propose a new ESAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners, the abolition of personal differentials, and a change in replacement rates.

We insist on protecting primary residences, imposing regulations on funds for meaningful negotiations prioritizing regulation over extermination, reducing banks' profit margins for reliable borrowers, finding a solution for borrowers with Swiss franc debts to get them out of deadlock, and providing 120 installments for debts to tax and social security funds.

We support the younger generation in realizing their dreams, so we propose 150,000 social housing units for rent at a low price, a reduction in labor taxes, and the subsidization of social security contributions for 50,000 young people in full-time employment.

We are addressing demography. We support families by providing nurseries for all children and reducing tax rates for families with two or more children to bring them closer to the European average. In our country, the difference in tax rates between a family with two children and a family with no children cannot exceed 3%, while in other countries facing similar issues, the difference is between 10 and 20 percentage points.

Finally, we are fighting for environmental protection and sustainable development. We are not handing over the production of Renewable Energy Sources to the powerful, but we are investing in energy democracy through energy communities for farmers, processors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and local government to have low production costs and address energy poverty.

Friends, this party has made Greece a leading player in European developments. This party did not expect to lead powerful countries. That is why it succeeded in getting Cyprus into the European Union with the unresolved Cyprus problem.

We are not, therefore, the "cops" of European decisions. We want Greece to be a protagonist, a co-shaper in the great changes for a Europe of peoples and solidarity, not the Europe of powerful economic interests. This is what we are fighting for: the creation of permanent common financial instruments that will support the productive base of European countries, especially those in the South. We also want a revision of the Dublin III Regulation, so that the burden does not fall only on the host countries, with a real and permanent relocation mechanism. We reject the Council proposal that New Democracy was celebrating, which provides for only 30,000 relocations, while 960,000 asylum applications were submitted last year alone. Additionally, we support a common foreign and defense policy with the creation of a European army to protect the European borders from Finland and Estonia to Greece and Cyprus. As long as Turkey continues to violate international law and our sovereign rights, our European partners cannot be allowed to continue to arm Turkey. This is solidarity in action, not just words.

Friends, on this new promising path, I want to make a single promise. But the most sincere and meaningful one. A promise that I intend to keep to the full: We will not betray your trust. We will not return to a past of toxicity and cheap confrontation. We will respect the strong mandate that the Greek people will give to PASOK. We will use it to exercise a dynamic and realistic opposition. But also to describe the Greece of the next day. With the prospect of the great return of the progressive party to the position it deserves. To be the strong opponent of New Democracy tomorrow and a progressive government in the years to come. So today, from here, under the Acropolis, the global symbol of democracy, I call on every progressive, every democrat to unite our struggles. To unite our hopes. To unite our dreams. To join our forces to walk together in the new era. To serve again, in a majority, in a leading role, the people and the country. For a strong PASOK, which will fight inside and outside the Parliament. Next to the citizen, next to the young, the worker, the woman. Next to every Greek who needs us. To build a Greece of sustainable development. Of opportunities for all. Of justice and social cohesion. Of inclusion against inequality and discrimination. Of rights and democracy against all kinds of authoritarianism. This was and this is our party. These are our ideas, our values, our principles. Our vision is a strong Greece of creation, dignity and social justice. That is why I invite you to walk together. With humanity in the face of cynicism, with seriousness in the face of arrogance, with certainty in the face of uncertainty and with responsibility in the face of unreliability. I call on every democrat, every progressive, whatever party you voted for in the last election, to join forces and fight together for the new victory! Let's make a decision for change together. A decision of social justice and national dignity. I urge you to take the effort into your own hands. Together in the new era we have a duty to do much. And we will do it together, with the public interest and the vision for a strong Greece as our compass. I beg you from the bottom of my heart. Not a minute wasted. Let us all fight together house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood in every city of the country until the last hour. There are only a few days left to achieve what our opponents thought was impossible. To make our movement, the Democratic Party, once again the leading actor. A genuine expression of the agony and dreams of the Greek people. The real opponent of maintenance. The real opponent of anarchocracy. The real opponent of the few who undermine the future of the many. It is our duty to revive this party to confront all forms of injustice. On Sunday 25 June we have only one choice: To win! And we will win! For us, for your children, for your grandchildren, for the Greece of the future. Friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for seeing the green flag of the Democratic Party waving proudly once again. Together we will fight to raise the sun high again in our country. The sun of hope, the sun of hope, the sun of perspective, the sun of justice, the sun of dignity. I thank you for your overwhelming presence and I pledge to fight every day not to disappoint anyone in this new relationship of trust we have built. All together for the great victory. For the rebirth of the Democratic Party. Raise our flag proudly. Raise proudly our principles, our values. All of us united together on Sunday night, we will once again be the great victors. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love and your trust. It is truly an emotional evening. It is an evening that sends a message of victory to every democrat, to every progressive Greek. The PASOK of our heart, the PASOK of our soul is here, united, strong. To serve the people and the homeland again. To confront inequalities, to confront injustices, to embrace the struggles of every ordinary Greek. We will be at your side in and out of Parliament. Trust, every democrat, every progressive, every Greek, every Greek, in this new path of dignity. This new great change of the great first victory on June 25. I am sure that the next meeting in Athens will be under our historic offices in Charilaou Trikoupis. On Sunday evening I expect you all together to celebrate at the party of Democracy, the party of the rebirth of the historical movement. And of course, before Sunday's appointment, the appointment at Eleftherias Square in Crete, which will once again become the castle of the Democratic Party. We will fight to make Crete green again. Be well! Good luck!
