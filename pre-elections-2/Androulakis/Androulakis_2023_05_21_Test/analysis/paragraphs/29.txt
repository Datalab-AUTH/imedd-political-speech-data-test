So I have a duty here from Heraklion to speak to the heart of the young people, those who in 1974, together with Andreas Papandreou, made this movement a people-born movement. Those who today do not trust politics. That is why our first priority is to rebuild a relationship of trust with young children, with young people, with the new generation, the new generation that fears that it will live worse than its parents. We also have a duty in the new era. We have a duty to confront all the establishments that are holding Greece back. We have a debt together to prove that our movement is politically autonomous, has no commitments and can serve the Greek people as it once did, the people and the country. That is what we were. That is what we will be again.
