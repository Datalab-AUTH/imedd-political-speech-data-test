The new era finds us all together, more united than ever before. And no matter how much we are beaten and no matter how much we are beaten, we will grow stronger because we have learned, we have learned our lessons and we have only one goal, the overthrow of the correlations, the clash with the establishment that will make PASOK again the real realistic responsible antisystemic force of Greece. We therefore keep the legacy of the Democratic Party, because we have always held high the flag of responsibility, progress and the dignity of the people. We have always held high the flag of social justice and national dignity. That is why we have a duty to give hope to every Greek to come back to the real genuine home of progress and not, and not to the so-called progressives, the sponsors of New Democracy. We have a duty to confront the populism of deceiving the many. And we also have a duty to confront the elitism of serving the few. The people do not need this power dichotomy that divides them, that keeps them in the past, that gives power only to the powerful. We must defend the vulnerable and the middle class. So that is why we are the ones who put up a barrier, we are the ones who prevent the worst scenarios for the country. Because we are the force of realism and responsibility.
