Friends, Mr Tsipras is the real golden sponsor of Mr Mitsotakis. The other day, Mr Tsipras said that his sponsor is Varoufakis, who is terrorising the centrist citizens with his 'Demetra' plans. And I ask you, is he the one who is talking about the Aegean Prespes? Is he who says that the sea has no borders not terrorising the centre?
