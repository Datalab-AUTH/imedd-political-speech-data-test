Friends, in Education, the new generation, I strive every day to embrace the anxieties of all Greeks. I struggle to embrace the anxieties of the middle class. You are the strength of the new era of PASOK. The common people, the common people. From you I expect us to fight together and bring victory on 21 May. I expect nothing from the domestic oligarchy because we are autonomous and strong and proud. So raise proudly the flag of PASOK, the flag of the Democratic Party.
