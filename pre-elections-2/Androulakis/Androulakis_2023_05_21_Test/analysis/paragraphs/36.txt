Second issue. Young people deserve good jobs. 700,000 people in Greece live on 400 and 500 euros. That is why we are proposing the creation of 50 thousand full-time jobs for young unemployed people. We are subsidising work, not unemployment in the private sector with a four-year subsidy of employer contributions. And finally, very crucially for young people and workers, we are reducing taxes on wage labour in order to combat black labour and to ensure that there are decent wages with respect for the labour rights of Greeks.
