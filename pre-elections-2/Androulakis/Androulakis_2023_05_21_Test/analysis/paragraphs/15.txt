Friends, the two-sided attack that we are being attacked is for one reason only, to stop our dynamic march on May 21. The domestic oligarchs are attempting to blackmail the people by drawing scenarios of instability. Mr Mitsotakis believes that we have forgotten what has happened in recent years and asks you to vote for him again. Forget about the parastate of wiretapping, forget about Patsis who bought red loans at the expense of the Greek people in order to speculate. The MP of the New Democracy. Forget, forget the 10 billion in direct commissions, forget that he is a champion of seconded employees, forget the executive chaos that we experienced here in Crete, not only in Evia and here in Crete, in Arkalochori, with the thousands of earthquake victims who even today are deceived and live in settlements. This is the staff chaos, the staff parastate that Mr Mitsotakis has set up to keep the Prime Minister's chair tied to his chair.
