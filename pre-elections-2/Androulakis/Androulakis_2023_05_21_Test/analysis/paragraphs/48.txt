Friends, farmers, farmers, livestock farmers, processors, the cost of production is rising. It is now very difficult to produce in Greece. What should we do? We have to bring down the cost of energy. How can we do that? How do others do it? The Recovery Fund became a network, it became an investment in renewable energy, but not for five oligarchs who will be neglecting the cable from Crete to mainland Greece or who will be neglecting the networks of mainland Greece, but it became a plan where thousands of producers can make energy communities and have low production costs in the next 15 years. I am committed that we will bring energy democracy, energy justice with priority to energy communities. Priority in terms of connection will be given to the country's producers and Municipal Energy Communities. What I am saying, you know, are not issues that I have imagined or that I have invented with our staff in PASOK. They are what is happening in every European country that works for the people and not for the oligarchs. This is PASOK's duty, to work again and serve the Greek people in a genuine way. Friends. For the farmers we once said that blood is not water. The farmer and the peasant all over Greece knows well who in the 1980s gave him extroversion and dignity. It was Andreas Papandreou's PASOK.
