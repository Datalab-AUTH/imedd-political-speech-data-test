Friends, our vision for Greece is grafted from the deep historical and social roots of PASOK. The vision of justice, of reducing inequalities, of a strong welfare state, of education and health care that act as an engine of upward mobility, as in the 1980s, when the child of the farmer and the stockbreeder became a doctor, an engineer and built his life and his family with dignity. This is what we must offer again to all Greek children.
