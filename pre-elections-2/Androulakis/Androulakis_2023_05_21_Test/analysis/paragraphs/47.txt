We universally protect agricultural land from the risk of confiscation. Not a single acre of Greek farmland to the crows of the funds. And of course, because those of you who know the problem, their lawyers call the borrowers and instead of going with a plan of regulation, they go with a plan of extermination because, Mr Tsipras, Mr Mitsotakis, they are not banks that want customers. These are crows who want to exterminate society to go to another society. We will therefore vote for a law that will define the framework of the borrower's negotiations with the funds so that priority is given to regulation and not to the deflation and annihilation of the Greek economy. We have a patriotic duty not to allow the gutting of the Greek economy. Finally, small and medium-sized enterprises that are choking on liquidity. Portugal, the recovery fund, the loans, made a special financial institution for those who cannot borrow from the banks. Mr Mitsotakis gave it all to banks. I am committed to making part of the recovery fund, the loans, a single financial institution with criteria beyond those of the banks, with environmental criteria, new jobs, digital growth synergies, in order to really support the liquidity of small and medium-sized enterprises. And the 120 instalments of Mr Mitsotakis' mockery. We have been saying for many months, bring in the 120 instalments, the market is suffocating and we are told what are you saying? We brought in the 120 instalments. So I call on all of you today, tomorrow morning, to ask your colleagues, the small and medium-sized enterprises, how many of them were able to join Mr Mitsotakis's 120 instalments, to see how much he disregards the common sense of the Greek people. I am committed to 120 instalments for both the tax office and the EFKA for everyone, in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
