Because I was not a danger to democracy, but this people, this proud gathering, this river, sends a message that the real danger to the strength of the New Democracy. Because they wanted a humiliated, small, tool in their hands to have an easy co-governor. There is no PASOK crutch, Mr Mitsotakis. There is PASOK strong, strong to send you and Mr Tsipras home. Friends, Sunday 21 May, Sunday 21 May, we are breaking the plans of the illegitimate two-party system. We end the tango of toxicity between Tsipras and Mitsotakis. We have a duty to turn the country around, to bring better days with a strong welfare state, with sustainable growth. We built a proud Greece. We are raising the sun again, we are rebuilding the strong Greece of the 21st century.
