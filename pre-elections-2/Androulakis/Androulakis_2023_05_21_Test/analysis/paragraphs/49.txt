Therefore, apart from the energy costs, we have to deal in a redemptive way with the precariousness of the rural world. So that is why we are saying specifically for agricultural inputs, animal feed, fuel, zero excise duty, agricultural oil, oil for the whole period of the crisis. And, of course, trying to prioritise addressing the problems of ELGA, we say update the ELGA Insurance Regulation with an extension of coverage for disasters to livestock and crops caused by climate change. This year we will have one of the worst summers ever. Climate change is ante portas and ELGA must adapt for the benefit of all farmers in the country, without the adventures and delays that undermine farmers' liquidity. Finally, friends, finally, the introduction of the unencumbered and tax-free nature of subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers.
