So where do we get the money from? When I said earlier that 150 listed companies have quadrupled their profits in '22, I'm saying something simple. Up to 50 thousand 5% we should get tax on dividends. Today it's for everyone, no matter how much they make 5%. We say up to 50,000, 5%. Above 50,000, it goes up from 5 on a sliding scale until the highest income gets 15%. This is how we tax wealth fairly and in a graduated manner, not as Mr. Tsipras did across the board. Secondly, last year at the TIF, Mr Mitsotakis announced a measure. To tell you the truth, listening to him, I did not believe that the Greece of bankruptcy and memoranda would have a prime minister who would say from the TIF that he would make parental benefits tax-free up to 4.8 million euros. Who are you addressing, Mr Mitsotakis? What middle-class family? Which household? Which weak Greek can give his child and grandchild a tax-free allowance of 4.8 million in real estate, movable property and shares?
