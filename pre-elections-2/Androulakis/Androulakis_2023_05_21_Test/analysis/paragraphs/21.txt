So, in front of us, Mr Mitsotakis is hiding what is coming as a side effect of his own political choices and on the other hand, Mr Tsipras, unrepentant, like in '15, is saying things that he cannot implement by deceiving, attempting to deceive once again the citizens. Friends, what does Mr Mitsotakis say? Give him, he says, self-reliance to raise the minimum wage to EUR 950 and the average wage to EUR 1 500. But he has nothing to say about where Greece is today, where Greece is with his government. The minimum wage, according to the OECD figures, which he despises, which he does not consider reliable. I have never heard a prime minister of a western country who does not consider the OECD figures to be reliable. We cannot listen, Mr Mitsotakis, only to the parroting of New Democracy in the media. Indeed, let us listen to an international organisation. The minimum wage, the real minimum wage, has fallen by 40%. The indirect taxes you paid in 2022 were two-thirds of total state revenues. Greek households are third from the bottom of the European Union in purchasing power. But watch out. And while all this is happening for the middle class and the poorest Greeks, 150 listed companies quadrupled their profits in 2022 unchecked, taking advantage of the energy crisis. It also does not mention that the public debt has increased by 50 billion and the trade deficit - and this is the most important thing because this is why we entered the memoranda - is the largest trade deficit since 2010, since Greece entered the memoranda.
