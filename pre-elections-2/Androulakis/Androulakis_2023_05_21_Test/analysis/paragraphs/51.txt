Because I repeat, we are building a new relationship of credibility with the Greek people. Friends, I really want to thank you because today here in Heraklion we have shown that this party with its deep historical social roots has returned to the heart of the Cretan people who loved it, who adored it, and we will fight until Sunday to be the first party in Heraklion, to be the green prefecture again, the castle of PASOK, the castle of the Democratic Party. We are forming a broad social alliance with all Greeks, a new current of progress and responsibility. We are putting a stop on 21 May to Mr Mitsotakis's arrogance. We are putting an end to the populism of Mr Tsipras. We have paid dearly for both of them. There is no such thing. PASOK came back to this square united, strong. We are again becoming the people-born movement of all generations of Greeks.
