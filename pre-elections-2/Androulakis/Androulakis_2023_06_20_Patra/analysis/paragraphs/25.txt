As far as public health is concerned, the situation in the National Health System is disheartening. Despite the fact that the pandemic has highlighted the need to revitalize the National Health System, New Democracy is condemning it daily with its policies. This is evident because the Greek people pay the second-highest private health expenditure in the entire European Union. We have seen what happened with the tragic shortages of EKAV. But it is not only EKAV that is missing 700 rescuers. There are also permanent positions in hospitals that are unfilled. I was at the Papanikolaou hospital a few days ago, and three and a half thousand citizens from Thessaloniki are waiting on shameful waiting lists in the operating theatres because there are only 7 anaesthetists for 28 posts provided.
