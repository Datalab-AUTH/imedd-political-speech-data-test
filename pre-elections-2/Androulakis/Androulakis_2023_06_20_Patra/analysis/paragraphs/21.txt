Friends, New Democracy presents an idyllic situation for the economy. Who will you believe? The channels that support it or the New Democracy MPs? I suggest that we listen to what the OECD and the European Commission say. The European institutions say that in Greece, real wages have not increased, as the New Democracy advertisements say, but have fallen by 7.4%. Also, real wages will continue to fall this year and in 2023. In its program and commercials, New Democracy promises a 25% increase in private sector wages, but in the medium-term plan that it submitted to the European Commission a few weeks ago, it pledges increases of only 13%. I say this because I understand the friends of New Democracy who were inspired here in Achaia to spread out with bushes to welcome Mr Mitsotakis. However, they have obviously spread the bushes because they think that Mr Mitsotakis, the 13% that he submitted to the European Commission, will make it 25%, just as Christ performed the miracle at Cana and multiplied the wine and bread. I am simply saying to the friends of New Democracy, who had this graphic inspiration with the vases, that in our case there is neither a messiah nor a miracle. There is mockery and contempt for the real problems of the Greek people. Indeed, such is their arrogance that the former Minister of Finance, Mr Skylakakis, confessed the unreliability of New Democracy. What did he say? We cannot put all our election promises into the stability programme. We know that. You did it in 2007, and we remember very well what your government delivered under Mr Karamanlis. Mr Mitsotakis is leading Greece along the same path.
