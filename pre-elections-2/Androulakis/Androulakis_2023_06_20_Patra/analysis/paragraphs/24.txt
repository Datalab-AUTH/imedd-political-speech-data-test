Friends, they talk about 7 billion in tax cuts, but in just 2 years, they have collected 5 billion in extra VAT and excise duty. Who did they collect it from? From the poorest and the middle class, because they pay the indirect taxes and not, as some in the New Democracy say, from the richest. The idea that VAT and excise tax hits the rich and not the poor is a novel economic theory. But let's look at the rest of the data. The country's external deficit, the current account deficit, was 12% last year and 9% this year, the largest since 2010. New Democracy replies that this is happening all over Europe, but they are lying. Portugal had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year, and other European countries have similar figures. The Recovery Fund has become a tool made by Europe to support the vulnerable, small and medium-sized enterprises, and powerful economic interests.
