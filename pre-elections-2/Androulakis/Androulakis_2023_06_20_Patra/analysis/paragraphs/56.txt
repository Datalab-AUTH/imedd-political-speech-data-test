Long live from Patras! We don't need to have the same government for the next 4 years. What does "the same" mean? It means an ineffective government, an arrogant and patronizing government, and an effective opposition. The opposition, with the mistakes of the government, is an easy opponent for New Democracy, which constantly compares its mistakes to those of the past. This is the mechanism of fear. The Greek people did not choose May 21 with hope for better days, but out of fear that Mr. Tsipras would bring the worst.
