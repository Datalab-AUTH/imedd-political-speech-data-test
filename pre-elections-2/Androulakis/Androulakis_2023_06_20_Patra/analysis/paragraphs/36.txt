All of this needs to be changed, and we will change it because we built the NHS. We have a duty to revitalize the National Health Service. That is why we propose using 8-10% of the resources from the Recovery Fund for the NHS to address gaps and to hire permanent staff, including health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category, with incentives for effective care on our islands and mainland Greece. Every town and village must have a strong primary care network, like any normal European country.
