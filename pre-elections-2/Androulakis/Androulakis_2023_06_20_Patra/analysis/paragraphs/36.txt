Friends and comrades, only a few days and a few hours remain. There is great anxiety, but also great joy in seeing all of you here. I am truly excited that our movement, which some thought had reached its end, is once again united, strong, and powerful. We will be even stronger on June 25th. Despite attempts by some to instill fear of ungovernability, they know very well that there is another fear, a real fear, not the imaginary fear conjured up by the communication systems that serve the Maximos building.
