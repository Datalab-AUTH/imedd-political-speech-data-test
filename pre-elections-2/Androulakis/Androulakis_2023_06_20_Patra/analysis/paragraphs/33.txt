Friends, the biggest issue for our patriotic movement and our country is the demographic issue. The threat of demographic danger must be addressed. That is why we propose 150,000 social housing units to be rented at a low price, the coverage of all children with nurseries, and tax exemptions for families with 2 children or more at the rates of the European Union average. Our country has the lowest tax exemptions for families with 2 children. We have a vision to reach 8-10% to give incentives for Greeks to have larger families and to reach the European Union average. This is our vision: a fair way of dealing with the demographic risk.
