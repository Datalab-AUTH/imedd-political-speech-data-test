It is not acceptable for SYRIZA to have a leadership that holds thousands of democrats and progressive citizens hostage. It is not an honor for Mr. Tsipras that he did not vote for the amendment that banned the participation of Fyssas' killers in our political system, and that three days before the national elections he called for misguided Chrysayghites to vote for SYRIZA. It is not just to condemn the closest collaborator and have them on the SYRIZA ballot papers. This is not our priority.
