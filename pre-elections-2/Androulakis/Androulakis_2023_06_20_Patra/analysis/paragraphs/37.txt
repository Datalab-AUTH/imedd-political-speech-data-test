It is the danger of uncontrolled, unaccountable omnipotence that will continue to play paracratic games, as shown in the cover-up of major scandals and the promotion of a powerful client state at the expense of the public interest, serving powerful oligarchic interests. That is why I ask you to support the Democratic Party in this new course. Know that the stronger PASOK is in the next four years, the stronger the Greeks who strive for a better future will be. Long live from Patras. We do not need more of the same in the next four years. And what does more of the same mean? It means an ineffective government and an effective opposition, and an arrogant and patronizing government. An opposition that, with the mistakes of its government, is an easy opponent of New Democracy, which constantly sets off its mistakes against the mistakes of yesterday. It is the mechanism of fear. The Greek people did not choose May 21 with the hope of better days, but out of fear that the worst would come with Mr. Tsipras. With a strong PASOK, the fear mechanism is over. With a strong PASOK, there will be the power of hope for better days. The power of the voice of the people, the power of a progressive movement whose program brings better days for all citizens. Friends, we have a duty to put an end to the golden sponsorship of the opposition.
