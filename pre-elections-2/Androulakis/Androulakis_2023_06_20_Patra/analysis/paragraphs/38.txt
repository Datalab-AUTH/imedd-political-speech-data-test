The real achievements of New Democracy must be highlighted by all of us in the coming days so that we can prove in practice that the word of the party, from all of us, from me and from all of you, becomes a wave, becomes a river in every part of the country, in every village, in every workplace. That is why I ask here in Achaia that you take the rebirth of the party in your hands in the coming days, in the coming hours, to speak the word of progress and truth to all our fellow citizens. Friends, here in Patras, I call on every democrat, every progressive Greek, whatever he or she voted in the last elections, to place their hopes in the new effort of the democratic party, in the effort of unity, renewal, and political autonomy. And every Greek, and I personally pledge that we will not disappoint anyone who will support PASOK in the effort to revive our movement. It is our country's duty to have a strong progressive force.
