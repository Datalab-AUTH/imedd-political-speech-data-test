So, friends, this is populism with a tie. New Democracy, taking advantage of the budgetary relaxation due to the pandemic and the energy crisis, has distributed â‚¬55 billion without any social or developmental focus. When the gentlemen of New Democracy have money, they distribute it unfairly to cronies and the powerful. But when the bill comes, they again unfairly take it from all of you.
