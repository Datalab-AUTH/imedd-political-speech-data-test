Friends, a huge issue is the field of precision. The inflation of obscenity is eroding the income of the Greek people, and they want to deal with this painful situation only with temporary solutions. We want permanent institutional measures, including a reduction in VAT on basic goods, market controls on fuel, and effective market controls to prevent some people from tripling their profits when Greek families are third from the bottom in purchasing power in all of Europe. It is the government's duty to use a portion of the tax overpayment due to inflation to support the poorest and middle class with institutional measures.
