But, friends, we have a duty to talk about what happened today in Tempe. Today we received the experts' conclusion on the tragedy. The tragedy has hurt and scarred the entire Greek people. The trains were running blindly without telecommand or safety systems. In 2014, the European Union gave us EUR 55 million, but the telecommand project was never completed. However, the Transparency Authority has pointed this out since October 2021. What did the responsible minister, Mr. Karamanlis, do? He kept the report of the Transparency Authority in his drawer instead of taking it to the prosecutor. They did not even hesitate to break the law in the buffet concerning the fatal stationmaster. Someone has to pay and will pay for the 57 of our fellow citizens who have unjustly lost their lives. And let them not be forgotten. They will be judged by justice and not by their constituency, as the communication systems of the New Democracy imply.
