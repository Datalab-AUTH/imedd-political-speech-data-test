PASOK is the party that, with our founder Andreas Papandreou, broke down the barriers of shame in Thrace in 1995. PASOK is the movement that, with George Papandreou as Minister of Education, made the law of 5 per thousand for Greek Muslim citizens to study in Greek universities and not in Ankara and Istanbul, so that in 20 years the number of Muslim scientists in Thrace has increased fivefold. This is the timeless work of PASOK, which has eliminated discrimination of all kinds in our country, whether political in '81 or religious later, because it is the party that unites, unifies, and strengthens the country, not the party that divides it.
