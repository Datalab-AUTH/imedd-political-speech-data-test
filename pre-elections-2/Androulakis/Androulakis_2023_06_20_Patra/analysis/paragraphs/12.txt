And because I want to send a reply from democratic Patras to both Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis, whatever mistakes our political opponents make, it is a shame that some people talk about national exceptions. For us, there are no national exceptions. You are not the homeland. The homeland is the entire Greek people. We criticize our opponents with political culture, without being divisive. In 2023, in a normal European country, it is a shame that some people are constantly talking about national exceptions, whether it was Tsipras and Kammenos or Mitsotakis and his company. That is why, on 25 June, our movement is once again a protagonist against these unacceptable practices.
