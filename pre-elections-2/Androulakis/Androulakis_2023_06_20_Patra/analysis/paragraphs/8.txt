Friends, Mr Mitsotakis says that there is a risk of ungovernability. And if you do not vote for New Democracy, he may spoil your August vacation. That is a nice fairy tale, but there is no dragon. The danger is the strengthening of impunity. The danger is that the service is not for the people and the country, but for the powerful who constantly coddle New Democracy and will continue to do so.
