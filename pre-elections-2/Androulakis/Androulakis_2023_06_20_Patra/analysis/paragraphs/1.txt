Friends, thank you very much for your moving and overwhelming welcome. We are sending a message of victory and revival of our movement from Achaia, the homeland of our founder Andreas Papandreou, the homeland of the old man of democracy. On June 25, the democratic party will be the great winner. It will once again be the genuine, progressive, strong opponent against New Democracy. On May 21, we took a first step. On June 25, we continue vigorously for the second big step of victory, of rebirth, of the people's struggle again for a movement that will embrace the struggles for social justice and national dignity. Every democratic progressive citizen, I call on every democrat, here in Patras today, whatever party they voted for in the previous national elections, to join our struggles, to join our hopes, to join our forces. Together we will achieve what our political opponents thought impossible a few years ago. I call on every democrat and every progressive to move forward together, all together, so that New Democracy once again has a real opponent and not its golden sponsor, Mr Tsipras. We need a political opponent with genuine progressive discourse, with a specific programme that will guarantee respect for human rights, the rule of law, the welfare state, the separation of powers, and sustainable development with benefits for all Greeks. On June 25, we are not facing the danger of ungovernability, we are facing the danger of the omnipotence of New Democracy, of impunity and arrogance. That is why we must all face together with PASOK a strong opposition tomorrow and a strong progressive government after a few years, and our struggle will be fully justified.
