But, friends, we have a duty to protect our fellow citizens who are being blackmailed by the funds. We have a duty not to hand over our agricultural land to foreign interests. We have a duty to pass a law in Parliament that sets negotiating criteria for the funds for the borrower, so that the priority is regulation and not the destruction of the Greek economy. And, of course, we must prevent increases in loan interest rates for weak Greeks. We need a solution for loans in Swiss francs, so that 80,000 families can get out of the impasse in which they find themselves. And, of course, we must provide universal protection for the first home, along the lines of the law passed by PASOK in 2010. We have a duty to protect the first home of the middle class and our vulnerable fellow citizens.
