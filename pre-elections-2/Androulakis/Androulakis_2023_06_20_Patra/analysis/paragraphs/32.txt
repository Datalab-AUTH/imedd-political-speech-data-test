What do we say? We see that PASOK is here to bring transparency and meritocracy. We propose that all organizations and hospitals should be filled through open international competitions and five-year terms of office to stop the game where the state is the prey of the Prime Minister. With a strong PASOK, there will be no more buffoonery and the state will not be treated as spoils. With a PASOK line-up, the best Greeks independently selected by the authorities in our country will serve the public institutions.
