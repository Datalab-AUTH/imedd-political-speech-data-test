Friends, here in Patras, I cannot help but speak about this city where inequalities have increased and infrastructure is lacking. We have a duty to make Patras the gateway of our country to Western Europe and to play a strong development role as a hub of trade and transport. This means completing the new railway line and connecting it to the new port. The construction of a new freight port and the upgrading of the airport at Araxos are infrastructure priorities for the Democratic Party because we serve a plan for strong regional development in all regions of our country.
