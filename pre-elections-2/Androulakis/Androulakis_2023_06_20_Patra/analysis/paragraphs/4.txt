The New Democracy treated the state as spoils, giving 10 billion in direct assignments, favorable amendments to day laborers, thousands of recruitments, the Patsides who profited from the red loans on the backs of the Greek people, and of course, the wiretapping scandal that exposed the country internationally. This situation must not be allowed to continue. We need a strong, credible, progressive opposition, and that is our duty on 25 June.
