We, as a genuine socialist movement, have a vision for every citizen and every family to have access to a strong public education and for all structures to provide opportunities for all Greek children to create and thrive without being limited by their family's financial situation. This is the future of social justice, future generations, and national dignity. Not the passports promised by Mr. Mitsotakis during the election.
