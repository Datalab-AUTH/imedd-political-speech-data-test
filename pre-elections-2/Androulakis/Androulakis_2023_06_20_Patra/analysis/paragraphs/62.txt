We uphold our work, the work of the party over the years, but I pledge that what has hurt the Greek people on the part of PASOK will not happen again. All together, we will follow this new course without mistakes. All together with the PASOK flag flying high. All together, having faith in our work and faith in our offer, we are recapturing the work of Andreas Papandreou and the movement of the democratic and progressive history of the country from Patras.
