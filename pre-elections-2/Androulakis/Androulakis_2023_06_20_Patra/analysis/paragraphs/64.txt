That is why the criterion is hope for better days. I ask every friend, every democrat to walk together. Because together we will walk with humanity in the face of cynicism, with seriousness in the face of arrogance, with certainty in the face of uncertainty, with responsibility in the face of populism and unreliability. I call on every democrat, every progressive, to make a decision for change, a decision of social justice and national dignity on June 25. I call upon you to raise the proud flag of PASOK and join our forces, struggles, and hopes to turn the country around. We owe it to all generations, our youth, and our country. The democratic, progressive movement was born to serve the people and the country, and to have a real credible opponent to the maintenance at home. Bless you and good strength. Today is still a step and June 25 is again front and center in the struggle. Together we will win. We have a duty not to disappoint anyone. June 25, the date of victory, the date of rebirth. PASOK is once again a leading player on the political stage of our country. Be well and have a good race.
