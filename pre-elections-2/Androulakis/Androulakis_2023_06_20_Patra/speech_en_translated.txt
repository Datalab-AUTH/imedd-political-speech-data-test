Friends, thank you very much for your moving and overwhelming welcome. We are sending a message of victory and revival of our movement from Achaia, the homeland of our founder Andreas Papandreou, the homeland of the old man of democracy. On June 25, the democratic party will be the great winner. It will once again be the genuine, progressive, strong opponent against New Democracy. On May 21, we took a first step. On June 25, we continue vigorously for the second big step of victory, of rebirth, of the people's struggle again for a movement that will embrace the struggles for social justice and national dignity. Every democratic progressive citizen, I call on every democrat, here in Patras today, whatever party they voted for in the previous national elections, to join our struggles, to join our hopes, to join our forces. Together we will achieve what our political opponents thought impossible a few years ago. I call on every democrat and every progressive to move forward together, all together, so that New Democracy once again has a real opponent and not its golden sponsor, Mr Tsipras. We need a political opponent with genuine progressive discourse, with a specific programme that will guarantee respect for human rights, the rule of law, the welfare state, the separation of powers, and sustainable development with benefits for all Greeks. On June 25, we are not facing the danger of ungovernability, we are facing the danger of the omnipotence of New Democracy, of impunity and arrogance. That is why we must all face together with PASOK a strong opposition tomorrow and a strong progressive government after a few years, and our struggle will be fully justified.

But, friends, the signs are already there regarding the future of our country with Mr. Mitsotakis. PASOK is here, united, strong, and fighting every day in every village, in every town, and with every citizen. We will stand by every Greek woman, every Greek man, vulnerable citizens, and the middle class. But, friends, what is the future with Mr. Mitsotakis?

Devaluation of the National Health System.

Devaluation of public education.

Burdening the middle class and the most vulnerable Greeks with extreme precision and indirect taxation.

The New Democracy treated the state as spoils, giving 10 billion in direct assignments, favorable amendments to day laborers, thousands of recruitments, the Patsides who profited from the red loans on the backs of the Greek people, and of course, the wiretapping scandal that exposed the country internationally.

This situation must not continue. We need a strong, credible progressive opposition, and that is our duty on June 25th.

Friends, Mr Mitsotakis says that there is a risk of ungovernability. And if you do not vote for New Democracy, he may spoil your August vacation. That is a nice fairy tale, but there is no dragon. The danger is the strengthening of impunity. The danger is that the service is not for the people and the country, but for the powerful who constantly coddle New Democracy and will continue to do so.

PASOK, our movement, the democratic progressive movement, is the barrier, the dike, the obstacle to this danger. From Patras, from Western Greece, from the land of Andreas Papandreou, it sends a message of victory to all of Greece, a message of rebirth, a message of hope and perspective.

Friends, in the last few days we have witnessed an extremely divisive situation concerning Thrace. Sensitive issues are being used by New Democracy to divide for petty party reasons, mimicking to an absolute degree the practices of Mr. Kamenos and Mr. Tsipras. Let both of them stop their dangerous adventurism.

PASOK is present in every village and town. It is our movement. Only a few days remain. Fight to become the big winners on Sunday night, those who send division, maintenance, and toxicity to the dustbin of history.

But, my friends, what did we witness? Dangerous adventurism, electoral adventurism with intelligence services' briefings. However, things are very simple. We cannot have a Greek Christian or a Greek Muslim member of the Greek Parliament who does not respect the Treaty of Lausanne. We will not play Mr. Erdogan's games.

PASOK is the party that, with our founder Andreas Papandreou, broke down the barriers of shame in Thrace in 1995. PASOK is the movement that, with George Papandreou as Minister of Education, made the law of 5 per thousand for Greek Muslim citizens to study in Greek universities and not in Ankara and Istanbul, so that in 20 years the number of Muslim scientists in Thrace has increased fivefold. This is the timeless work of PASOK, which has eliminated discrimination of all kinds in our country, whether political in '81 or religious later, because it is the party that unites, unifies, and strengthens the country, not the party that divides it.

But I did not expect the experienced Mrs. Bakoyannis and the Prime Minister's close associate, Mr. Skertsos, to threaten Greek citizens with vocabulary from the 50s and 60s, far from the European acquis.

This vocabulary was consigned to the dustbin of history by PASOK in 1981.

And because I want to send a reply from democratic Patras to both Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis, it is a shame that some people talk about national exceptions, whatever mistakes our political opponents make.

For us, there are no national exceptions. The homeland is not just you. The homeland is the entire Greek people. We criticize our opponents with political culture without being divisive.

It is a shame that in the year 2023, in a normal European country, some people keep talking about national exceptions, whether it is Tsipras and Kammenos or Mitsotakis and his company.

That is why on June 25, our movement is once again a protagonist against these unacceptable practices.

But, friends, we have a duty to talk about what happened today in Tempe. Today we received the experts' conclusion on the tragedy - the tragedy that has hurt and scarred the entire Greek people. The trains were running blindly without telecommand or safety systems. In 2014, the European Union gave us EUR 55 million, but the telecommand project was never completed. However, the Transparency Authority has been pointing this out since October 2021. What did the responsible minister, Mr. Karamanlis, do? He kept the report of the Transparency Authority in his drawer instead of taking it to the prosecutor. They did not even hesitate to break the law in the buffet concerning the fatal stationmaster. Someone has to pay and will pay for the 57 of our fellow citizens who have unjustly lost their lives. And let them not be forgotten. They will be judged by justice and not by their constituency, as the communication systems of the New Democracy imply.

Friends, New Democracy presents an idyllic situation for the economy. Who will you believe? The channels that support it or the New Democracy MPs? I suggest that we listen to what the OECD and the European Commission say. The European institutions say that in Greece, real wages have not increased, as the New Democracy advertisements say, but have fallen by 7.4%. Also, real wages will continue to fall this year and in 2023. In its program and commercials, New Democracy promises a 25% increase in private sector wages, but in the medium-term plan that it submitted to the European Commission a few weeks ago, it pledges increases of only 13%. I say this because I understand the friends of New Democracy who were inspired here in Achaia to spread out with bushes to welcome Mr Mitsotakis. However, they have obviously spread the bushes because they think that Mr Mitsotakis, the 13% that he submitted to the European Commission, will make it 25%, just as Christ performed the miracle at Cana and multiplied the wine and bread. I am simply saying to the friends of New Democracy, who had this graphic inspiration with the vases, that in our case there is neither a messiah nor a miracle. There is mockery and contempt for the real problems of the Greek people. Indeed, such is their arrogance that the former Minister of Finance, Mr Skylakakis, confessed the unreliability of New Democracy. What did he say? We cannot put all our election promises into the stability programme. We know that. You did it in 2007, and we remember very well what your government delivered under Mr Karamanlis. Mr Mitsotakis is leading Greece along the same path.

So, friends, this is populism with a tie. New Democracy, taking advantage of the budgetary relaxation due to the pandemic and the energy crisis, has distributed â‚¬55 billion without any social or developmental focus. When the gentlemen of New Democracy have money, they distribute it unfairly to cronies and the powerful. But when the bill comes, they again unfairly take it from all of you.

That is why we are here with our program as a responsible opposition, so that they know they are no longer facing populism and wishful thinking, but credibility, progress, and responsibility. This way, we can point out the real failures that harm our country.

Friends, they talk about 7 billion in tax cuts, but in just 2 years, they have collected 5 billion in extra VAT and excise duty. Who did they collect it from? From the poorest and the middle class, because they pay the indirect taxes and not, as some in the New Democracy say, from the richest. The idea that VAT and excise tax hits the rich and not the poor is a novel economic theory. But let's look at the rest of the data. The country's external deficit, the current account deficit, was 12% last year and 9% this year, the largest since 2010. New Democracy replies that this is happening all over Europe, but they are lying. Portugal had a 1% deficit last year and a 1% surplus this year, and other European countries have similar figures. The Recovery Fund has become a tool made by Europe to support the vulnerable, small and medium-sized enterprises, and powerful economic interests.

We propose a competitive, sustainable, outward-looking production that plays a pioneering role in Made in Greece. We will use the Development Fund to plan tourism, manufacturing, livestock, and agri-food as tools for a strategic plan that will create good jobs and increase exports throughout the Greek region. We invest in supporting innovative businesses to add value to our economy.

Friends, a huge issue is the field of precision. The inflation of obscenity is eroding the income of the Greek people, and they want to address this painful situation only with temporary solutions.

We want permanent institutional measures including a reduction in VAT on basic goods, market controls, fuel controls, and effective market controls to prevent some people from tripling their profits. The Greek family is third from the bottom in purchasing power in all of Europe. It is the government's duty to use a portion of the tax overpayment due to inflation to support the poorest and middle class with institutional measures.

PASOK's priority is to embrace the anxieties of citizens outside the economic walls, citizens on the brink of despair. We say to them today from Patras that we will stand by you. A strong PASOK means a strong voice for all of you.

However, New Democracy continues on the path that has unrepentantly led the country into the unworthiness and opacity of memoranda.

He accuses PASOK of old partisanship and populism. What about the PASOK that spoke the painful truth during the AÎ£EP, transparency, open government, independent authorities, and everything that was done to establish meritocracy and respect for citizens in our country?

But they continue to play the same game by appointing inexperienced individuals to hospitals and organizations, such as those involved in the tragedy of Tempe.

What do we say? We see that PASOK is here to bring transparency and meritocracy. We propose that all organizations and hospitals should be filled through open international competitions and five-year terms of office to stop the game where the state is the prey of the Prime Minister. With a strong PASOK, there will be no more buffoonery and the state will not be treated as spoils. With a PASOK line-up, the best Greeks independently selected by the authorities in our country will serve the public institutions.

Friends, another major issue is the employer immunity reinforced by the policies of the Conservative Party.

We promote a new regulation of labor relations with social dialogue for work, with rules and security, and decent wages always determined by free collective bargaining and strong control mechanisms.

As far as public health is concerned, the situation in the National Health System is disheartening. Despite the fact that the pandemic has highlighted the need to revitalize the National Health System, New Democracy is condemning it daily with its policies. This is evident because the Greek people pay the second-highest private health expenditure in the entire European Union. We have seen what happened with the tragic shortages of EKAV. But it is not only EKAV that is missing 700 rescuers. There are also permanent positions in hospitals that are unfilled. I was at the Papanikolaou hospital a few days ago, and three and a half thousand citizens from Thessaloniki are waiting on shameful waiting lists in the operating theatres because there are only 7 anaesthetists for 28 posts provided.

All of this needs to be changed, and we will change it because we built the NHS. We have a duty to revitalize the National Health Service. That is why we propose using 8-10% of the resources from the Recovery Fund for the NHS to address gaps and to hire permanent staff, including health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category, with incentives for effective care on our islands and mainland Greece. Every town and village must have a strong primary care network, like any normal European country.

Friends, in education, education is the lever of social justice that gives hope and perspective to Greek children for PASOK. We are responding with a reform that brings the national baccalaureate to the fore, breaking down inequalities with remedial teaching, a safe school environment with psychological and social support services, and of course, an inclusive school with strong special education structures for all children. Parents who have children on the autism spectrum cannot live in conditions far worse than any European society.

As a genuine socialist movement, we have a vision for every citizen and family to have access to strong public education and opportunities for all Greek children to create and thrive without being limited by their family's financial situation. This is the future of social justice, future generations, and national dignity.

And not the promises that Mr Mitsotakis made during the election.

Friends, our pensioners, there are thousands of low-income pensioners who are living in desperate conditions after Mr. Tsipras abolished EKAS.

We propose a new ESAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners and the elimination of the personal contribution as of 1/1/2024.

New Democracy will fall when the real alternative is reborn. The progressive, democratic, and credible party, PASOK, the Movement for Change. We will confront maintenance. We will confront elitism, we will confront populism.

From June 26th, Mr. Mitsotakis will not have an ineffective opposition against him, but a strong democratic movement, PASOK. So let's fight every day, every hour, all together to be victorious on June 25th.

But, friends, we have a duty to protect our fellow citizens who are being blackmailed by the funds. We have a duty not to hand over our agricultural land to foreign interests. We have a duty to pass a law in Parliament that sets negotiating criteria for the funds for the borrower, so that the priority is regulation and not the destruction of the Greek economy. And, of course, we must prevent increases in loan interest rates for weak Greeks. We need a solution for loans in Swiss francs, so that 80,000 families can get out of the impasse in which they find themselves. And, of course, we must provide universal protection for the first home, along the lines of the law passed by PASOK in 2010. We have a duty to protect the first home of the middle class and our vulnerable fellow citizens.

Friends, the biggest issue for us and our patriotic movement is the demographic issue of our country. The threat of demographic danger must be addressed.

That is why we propose 150,000 social housing units to be rented at a low price.

The coverage of all children with nursery schools and tax exemptions for families with two or more children at rates equivalent to the European Union average.

Our country has the lowest tax allowances for a family with two children.

We have a vision to reach 8-10%, to match the European Union average and to incentivize Greeks to have larger families. Our vision is to deal with the demographic risk in a fair way.

We are also fighting for a fair and green transition because we are prioritizing that farmers, processors, cooperatives, municipalities, and not the oligarchs, speculate at the expense of the Greek people, as happened with natural gas. We were once told that they were all green horses. No, it is justice, social justice, and energy democracy. It is about safeguarding the cost of living and securing the geopolitical position of the country so that it does not have dependencies on gas and third countries in geopolitical risk and instability.

Friends, here in Patras, I cannot help but speak about this city where inequalities have increased and infrastructure is lacking. We have a duty to make Patras the gateway of our country to Western Europe and to play a strong development role as a hub of trade and transport. This means completing the new railway line and connecting it to the new port. The construction of a new freight port and the upgrading of the airport at Araxos are infrastructure priorities for the Democratic Party because we serve a plan for strong regional development in all regions of our country.

Friends and comrades, only a few days and a few hours remain. There is great anxiety, but also great joy in seeing all of you here. I am truly excited that our movement, which some thought had reached its end, is once again united, strong, and powerful. We will be even stronger on June 25.

As much as some people try to re-impose the fear of ungovernability, they know very well that there is another fear, real and not imaginary, that the communication systems serving the Maximos building convey.

It is the danger of uncontrolled and unaccountable omnipotence that will continue to play parochial games, as shown in the cover-up of major scandals and the support of a powerful client state at the expense of the public interest, which serves powerful oligarchic interests.

That is why I ask you to support the Democratic Party in this new journey. Know that the stronger PASOK is in the next four years, the stronger the Greeks who are striving for a better future will be.

Long live from Patras! We don't need to have the same government for the next 4 years. What does "the same" mean? It means an ineffective government, an arrogant and patronizing government, and an effective opposition. The opposition, with the mistakes of the government, is an easy opponent for New Democracy, which constantly compares its mistakes to those of the past. This is the mechanism of fear. The Greek people did not choose May 21 with hope for better days, but out of fear that Mr. Tsipras would bring the worst.

With a strong PASOK, the fear mechanism will be overcome. With a strong PASOK, there will be hope for better days. The power of the people's voice, the power of a progressive movement whose program brings better days for all citizens.

Friends, we have a duty to put an end to the opposition's golden sponsorship.

The real achievements of New Democracy must be highlighted by all of us in the coming days so that we can prove in practice that the word of the party, from all of us, from me and from all of you, becomes a wave, becomes a river in every part of the country, in every village, in every workplace. That is why I ask here in Achaia that you take the rebirth of the party in your hands in the coming days, in the coming hours, to speak the word of progress and truth to all our fellow citizens. Friends, here in Patras, I call on every democrat, every progressive Greek, whatever he or she voted in the last elections, to place their hopes in the new effort of the democratic party, in the effort of unity, renewal, and political autonomy. And every Greek, and I personally pledge that we will not disappoint anyone who will support PASOK in the effort to revive our movement. It is our country's duty to have a strong progressive force.

It is not acceptable for SYRIZA to have a leadership that holds thousands of democrats and progressive citizens hostage. It is not an honor for Mr. Tsipras that he did not vote for the amendment that banned the participation of Fyssas' killers in our political system, and that three days before the national elections, he called for misguided Chrysayghites to vote for SYRIZA. It is not just to condemn the closest collaborator and have them on the SYRIZA ballot papers. This is not our priority.

Our priority is justice, transparency, and meritocracy, so I will not allow anyone to hurt the Greek people again.

We uphold our work, the work of the party over the years, but I pledge that what has hurt the Greek people on the part of PASOK will not happen again. All together, we will follow this new course without mistakes. All together with the PASOK flag flying high. All together, having faith in our work and faith in our offer, we are recapturing the work of Andreas Papandreou and the movement of the democratic and progressive history of the country from Patras.

Friends, together we will move forward. Every democrat, progressive citizen, let's build a strong majority current of a modern center-left that confronts maintenance. A modern center-left that will be a government of values and principles, not a government for power and chairs.

That is why the criterion is hope for better days. I ask every friend, every democrat to walk together. Because together we will walk with humanity in the face of cynicism, with seriousness in the face of arrogance, with certainty in the face of uncertainty, with responsibility in the face of populism and unreliability. I call on every democrat, every progressive, to make a decision for change, a decision of social justice and national dignity on June 25. I call upon you to raise the proud flag of PASOK and join our forces, struggles, and hopes to turn the country around. We owe it to all generations, our youth, and our country. The democratic, progressive movement was born to serve the people and the country, and to have a real credible opponent to the maintenance at home. Bless you and good strength. Today is still a step and June 25 is again front and center in the struggle. Together we will win. We have a duty not to disappoint anyone. June 25, the date of victory, the date of rebirth. PASOK is once again a leading player on the political stage of our country. Be well and have a good race.
