I went to meet with the management of the ambulance service the day before yesterday. The ambulance service, along with our hospitals, is understaffed. They are missing 80 ambulances from their fleet, and to meet international standards, we still need 700 rescuers to man them. As a result, islands such as Cyclades and the Dodecanese, which expect hundreds of thousands of travelers, especially during the summer months, have only one ambulance available around the clock, which means 3 eight-hour shifts. According to the President of the EHIC, an additional 20 ambulances are needed to meet the needs in the basin, and an additional 10 nights on each shift. New Democracy decided that it could afford to recruit 1000 people for the notorious university police, which is not working, but it could not afford to support the ambulance service and our hospitals while we were going through the tragedy of the pandemic, as other European countries did. Greece has barely channeled 2% of the Recovery Fund to the NHS and another 2% to building upgrades, when other countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy have allocated 8 to 11% of the Recovery Fund. According to the latest Eurostat data, Greece has worsened its position in private health spending. I have often said in my interviews that we were third in private spending across Europe. We were overtaken by Bulgaria and Lithuania. Mr. Mitsotakis has made the country's position worse. Now we are second in Europe from the bottom in private spending, and we are only surpassed by Bulgaria. That is why we are in debt. We, who built the NHS with George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos, should revive the NHS so that there is a safety net for all the Greek people, especially for the most vulnerable Greeks.
