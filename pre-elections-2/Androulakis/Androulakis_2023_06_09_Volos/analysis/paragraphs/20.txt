Secondly, a very serious point is the biggest national issue of our country, which is demographics. All of Europe is facing a huge demographic issue. What can we do? Other countries such as Portugal have a 10 point tax rate reduction between a family with no children and a family with 2 children, while the Czech Republic has 14% and Ireland has 15%. In contrast, we only have 3%. Therefore, our goal is for the tax system to incentivize young couples to address the national bombshell of the demographic issue. Mr. Mitsotakis, this should be our priority, not pandering to media lords and oligarchs who obviously want you as Prime Minister because of your faithful service to them over the last few years. We are fighting for the many, not the few. We are fighting nationally to address the major issues of Greek society so that Greek children can stay here, create wealth, and have a strong country.
