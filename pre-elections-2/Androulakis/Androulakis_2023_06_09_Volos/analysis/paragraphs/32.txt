Friends, for consistent borrowers we must provide incentives. Therefore, measures should be taken to eliminate and prevent interest rate increases on loans for weak households and those who remain in their arrangements. Additionally, the profit margin of banks must be reduced. We have given billions to support this. The profit margin should have strong incentives for consistent borrowers, and finally, the new Republic says there should be 120 instalments. Take a tour of the marble shops tomorrow morning and ask how many of your fellow citizens have been able to join Mr Mitsotakis' 120 instalments, and you will understand to what extent he disregards the intelligence of the Greek people. Always with 120 instalments for regulations for everyone, for Eva, and for the tax office. This is PASOK's policy so that there is liquidity for small and medium-sized enterprises.
