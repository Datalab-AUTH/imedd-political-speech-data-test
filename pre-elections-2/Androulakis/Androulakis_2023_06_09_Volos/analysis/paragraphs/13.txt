Friends, speaking of corruption, I cannot help but talk about the issue of Tempe. This unspeakable tragedy is etched in the collective consciousness of the Greek people. Today, I passed through Tempe to lay a few flowers and to send a message that we have a duty not to forget and will not forget the state that tragically led 57 people to lose their lives unjustly. A state that cannot guarantee the basic necessities to its citizens. So, how do we change this state? How are we going to radically address the clientelistic logic? How are we going to deal with the phenomena of unworthiness and corruption?
