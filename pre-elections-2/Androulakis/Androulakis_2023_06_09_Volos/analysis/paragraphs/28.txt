In education, which is the lever of social justice and social upward mobility, the same lever that in the 1980s made the farmer's child a doctor or an engineer, giving them strength, dignity, and perspective, it must be reconstructed. We cannot simply shade issues like in base 10. Yes, there will be some admission criteria, but is that the only issue? Shouldn't we focus on public schooling instead of tutoring at the expense of poorer Greeks? Therefore, our priority is to regenerate public schools and universities without obsessing about the private sector. If there can be a large investment for a private university, we will not stand in the way, but our priority is public education that will embrace the aspirations of all younger generations and equip them for the future. That is why we propose the introduction of the national baccalaureate, so that a student's future is not judged in a stressful two-week process, but over a two-year period with multiple examinations.
