Second point: Our priority is a unified European foreign policy and a European army. There must be common security structures from Estonia and Finland to Greece and Cyprus. As with FRONTEX, the Euro army should not require us to pay billions for guarding the Euro-Turkish border and arming Turkey instead of supporting us. This is the vision of a Europe for the people, not for the powerful, whom some serve faithfully without calling a spade a spade. We serve the Europe of peoples and solidarity, not the Europe of the directorate, as some flexible people in the domestic political system do.
