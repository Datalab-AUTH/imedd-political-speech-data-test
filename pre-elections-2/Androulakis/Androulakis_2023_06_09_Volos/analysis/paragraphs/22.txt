Friends, we have a duty to do much, but we will do it together, in the word of truth and consistency. Today, New Democracy says we cannot reduce VAT because it will not be passed on to goods. But then why was New Democracy reducing the rate by 2 points in the 2019 program? Didn't it know the problem then? And what are we saying? To reduce VAT on basic goods, on the products that every Greek woman, every household, and the poorest Greeks buy. If Mr. Skurchos' answer is that indirect taxes are paid by the oligarchs, which is above any economic theory, the answer is that as much milk as a rich man drinks, a poor man can drink, but the rich man's pocket is much deeper than the poor man's pocket. Let's leave the new economic theories which have nothing to do with anything that is discussed in the economic universities. They also say we lowered the rates. Yes, we lowered the rates because the real tax storm in taxes and contributions happened under Mr. Tsipras who said 'don't pay the red loans' and handed over the red loans to the fund crows. He said he would lower the rates and raised taxes for all Greeks. But what is the truth about New Democracy? Yes, they lowered the rates, but the poor and middle class gain less and the rich gain much more. Why? For a simple reason. New Democracy's interventions in the tax system over four years were 7 billion. And in just 2 years, they took 5 billion more VAT than the budgeted VAT from the poorest and the middle class. So in 4 years, 7 billion was given, and in 2.5 billion was taken from the weakest Greeks. This is the reality of the fiscal data on tax.
