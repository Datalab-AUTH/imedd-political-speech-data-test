On the issue of taxes, they are lying about PASOK having a hidden agenda. There is no hidden agenda. I have said it before the last election: our agenda is not a tax agenda, it is the agenda of tax justice. That is why what PASOK is proposing is what is happening in all Western European countries, not what is happening in Hungary, Poland, and Lithuania. It is the ambition of the Greek people to belong to old Europe and not to countries with huge social inequalities, a weak middle class, and powerful oligarchs. This is the vision of Mr. Mitsotakis, and we oppose a strong economy in the hands of the Greeks and not the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy and the strengthening of a few oligarchs at the expense of the middle class.
