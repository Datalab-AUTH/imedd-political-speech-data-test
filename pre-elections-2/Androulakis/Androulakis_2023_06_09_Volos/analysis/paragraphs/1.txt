Friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your overwhelming presence on June 25th. We give dignity, hope, and perspective to every Greek woman and every Greek man. Friends, we are starting this election campaign, fighting in every city and every village to overturn a toxic two-party system that has led to four more years of lost time.
