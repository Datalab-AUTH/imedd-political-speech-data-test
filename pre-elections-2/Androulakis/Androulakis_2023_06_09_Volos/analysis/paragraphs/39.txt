In recent years, there has been opposition that has said things that could not be implemented. However, the New Democracy has made itself comfortable because all of its choices lead to new dead ends as an unrepentant conservative force. An out-of-control government prefers a toxic and weak opposition. That is why Mr. Mitsotakis does not want a united and strong PASOK. That is why they are fighting us, but that is also why we are getting stronger because we know our duty is to regenerate the opponent, the strong opponent that conservation needs in the country.
