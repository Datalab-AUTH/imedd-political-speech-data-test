2 equal members of the European Union. This is what European solidarity means. So what are we saying about that? There must be negotiations between Europe and Turkey. Negotiations for a new framework do not exist in the European perspective for Turkey. What do we propose? If Turkey wants an upgrade of the 1995 Customs Union, as it says, there must be a framework of automated sanctions on the part of Europe, in which case human rights within Turkey or sovereign rights against European states are violated.
