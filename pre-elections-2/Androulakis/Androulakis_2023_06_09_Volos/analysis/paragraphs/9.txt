Friends, how else can I describe him other than a supporter of the New Democracy party? His backtracking on the Aegean Prespes agreement, his officials' recent statements on the Turkish minority, all of these actions support the New Democracy party. Our party is democratic, progressive, and above all, patriotic, and has nothing to do with this nonsense that comes at the expense of our national interests.
