I have publicly proposed to all parties that we commit ourselves to ending the spoils state. After every national election, party children and failed MPs are appointed to organizations such as OSE, hospitals, and dozens of other organizations. They are not appointed to serve the people, but to serve the party establishment of the government of the day. For this reason, we propose here in Volos that an open international competition with high financial incentives be held. This will bring the best Greeks with the most prepared CVs who have sufficient knowledge and consistency to serve the public interest. This is how we will build meritocracy. This is how citizens will understand that this tragedy, where 57 lives were unjustly lost, will not happen again. We will radically change our state for the benefit of the Greek people, especially the weakest Greeks. There will be no impunity for the protagonists of the Tempi tragedy. Some people think that because the people voted for them, we will forget. We will not forget what happened, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that these people who lost their lives are vindicated along with their families. It was the most tragic thing that has happened in recent years.
