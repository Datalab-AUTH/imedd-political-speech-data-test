But Mr. Mitsotakis continues to blackmail. We were surprised to hear a new childish blackmail. What is he saying? "Vote for me so that I don't spoil your August holidays." You know, all this reminds me of the previous argument, "Vote for me because Androulakis is not meeting me." This is all very well for a laugh, but we have a duty to fight for the new democracy to have a real opponent so that Mr. Mitsotakis can see what a credible progressive opposition means.
