But, friends, at the end of the last election, we saw, in my humble opinion, the worst that Mr Tsipras had to offer. All the years he was leader of Syriza, and there was nothing more. Something that offends every leftist, every democrat, every progressive Greek. It was revealed just a few days before the elections that he had not voted for the amendment that prevented the criminal Golden Dawn from taking part in the elections. He did not vote for it to invite them to vote for SYRIZA, the so-called voters who did not know what was going on with the criminally imprisoned neo-Nazis. This has nothing to do with the values of socialism, democracy, progress, and the left that PASOK has represented from 1974 until today, since the time of our founder Andreas Papandreou. To this day, this party has never flirted with the extremes, nor has it undermined our national interests. We must not forget them; we have historical and social memory.
