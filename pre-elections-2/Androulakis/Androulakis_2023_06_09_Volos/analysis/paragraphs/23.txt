Friends and colleagues, regarding pensions, we don't have much to say. We won't discuss the thirteenth pension as it amounts to 2.7 billion euros, which we have already accounted for in our program. Instead, we propose three measures that aim to bring justice and address significant injustices in the pension system. The first measure is the reintroduction of the ESAS for 350,000 low-income pensioners who are on the brink of despair. The second measure is the elimination of the personal differential as of 1/01/24. Finally, we aim to rectify the injustices in the provisions concerning disability and widows' pensions. The total cost of these measures is one billion, 130 million euros, and they can be implemented immediately as they have a low fiscal impact.
