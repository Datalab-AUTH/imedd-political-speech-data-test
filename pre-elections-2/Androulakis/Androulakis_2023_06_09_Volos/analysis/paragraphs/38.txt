Friends, in closing, I would like to thank you because I have met happy faces, new faces, and all generations of the Democratic Party reunited from all corners of the country. This gives me enormous strength to continue the struggle for the rebirth of PASOK, the movement founded in 1974 with a duty to serve the people and the country. For this reason, I pledge that in this new course, PASOK will be by your side every day. Our political struggles will not be exhausted in Parliament, but we will be in every corner of Greece for young social struggles. We have a duty to fight daily battles for more opportunities for young people, for Greek children to stop being crammed into airplanes, and to find a better fate abroad. The need for perspective, Greece, and Hellenism is from all corners of the world.
