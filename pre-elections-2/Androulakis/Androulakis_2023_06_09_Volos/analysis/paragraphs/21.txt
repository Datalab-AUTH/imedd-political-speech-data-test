Friends, let's move on to the rest of the lies and big words. The New Democracy party brought bankruptcy in 2009 and imposed the memorandum, yet remains unrepentant. It tells the Greek people through speeches and statements that it will increase the average private sector wage by 25%. I cannot imagine how this will be achieved by royal decree or law. How can the state impose a 25% wage increase in the private sector? Let's examine the truth. Is it true that the medium-term plan submitted by the Mitsotakis government provides a cumulative 13% increase in wages, not the 25% that New Democracy MPs claim on TV to mock us? They say one thing in Europe and another thing here, showing contempt for the intelligence of the Greek people.
