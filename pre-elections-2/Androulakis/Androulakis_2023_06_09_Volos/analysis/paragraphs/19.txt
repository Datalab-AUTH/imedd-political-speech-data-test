Now let's go and see what we want to do. What do we want to achieve with our own tax policies? Our main goal is to reduce the tax on labor. We aim to address the issue of undeclared work, which will result in higher wages. By reducing social security contributions, we can combat undeclared work, support our funds, and provide better wages to workers with improved working conditions.
