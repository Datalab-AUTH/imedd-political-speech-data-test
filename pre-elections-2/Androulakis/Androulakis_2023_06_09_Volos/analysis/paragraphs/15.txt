Friends, in the economy, things are presented by many media outlets that faithfully serve the Mitsotakis system in a heavenly way, suggesting that everything is going well. Who are we to believe? The European Commission or the OECD? I urge you to believe the international organizations that were telling the truth in 2007, no matter how much some people said they had a shielded economy. Do we all remember what happened two years later when the New Democracy handed us a fiscal bomb in 2009? So what are the facts? Real wages have fallen by 7.4% in Greece, not risen by 20% as Mr. Skertos nominally says. The external deficit has reached 12% last year and is estimated at 9.2% this year. The New Democracy is responding because of the pandemic, which is happening all over Europe. We are answering them here from Volos that Portugal, a country with similar economic issues, had a 1% deficit last year and this year has a 1% surplus. We are the only country that has the largest and most difficult external deficit in recent years, noting that it is the largest since 2010. We can understand through this data the problematic nature of our country's economy.
