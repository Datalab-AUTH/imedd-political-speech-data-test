What does PASOK say that others don't? We have a duty. Priority in the interconnection to the grid for renewable energy sources should be given to cooperatives, farmers, processors, municipalities, and not the oligarchs. Mr Mitsotakis, the green transition must be a weapon of the middle class, of creative Greece, to be a modern European state. We should not depend on natural gas, which is a foreign fuel that undermines the country's energy stability and geopolitical position. We should not hand over the green transition and renewable resources to the few and the powerful. We are against policies that make the powerful stronger at the expense of the many. We are proposing a just green transition by spreading renewable energy production to all Greeks, to productive Greece.
