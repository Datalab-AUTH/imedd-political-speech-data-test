Finally, we have a duty to prevent the destruction of land, so there must be universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation. The establishment of subsidies, compensation, and aid for farmers should be unconditional and tax-free. Additionally, while we are in the Mediterranean, which is affected by the phenomena of climate change, ELGA should compensate farmers who have been affected by these extreme phenomena. Therefore, we propose updating the ELGA insurance regulation to cover all disasters in the animal or plant kingdom caused by climate change. Climate change is not a temporary issue, and we must defend all those whose production is undermined by these new weather events. Finally, the whole process for the programs of the new common agricultural policy must be completed within a year to stop the bureaucracy.
