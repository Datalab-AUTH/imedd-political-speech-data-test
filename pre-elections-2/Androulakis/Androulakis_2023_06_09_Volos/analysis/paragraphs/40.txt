Friends, there must be a programmatic, progressive, and realistic impression of opposition. A strong force is needed to embrace the anxieties of the Greek people and to speak honestly about national and social issues. Turkey recently had elections, and we heard things that are out of touch with reality. Some people said it's better for Mr Erdogan to come out, while others said it's better for Mr Kilicdaroglu to come out. However, they did not acknowledge that Turkey's aggressive policy, which challenges our sovereign rights, is a collective policy, excluding the pro-Kurdish HDP party. Therefore, we are saying simple things: it's not enough for Greece to arm itself, Mr Mitsotakis. We support strengthening the country and agreements on our deterrent power, but we will not participate in an arms race when European states are arming Turkey. Our priority is to stop selling even one bullet to Turkey as long as it undermines good neighborly relations and our sovereign rights in Greece and Cyprus.
