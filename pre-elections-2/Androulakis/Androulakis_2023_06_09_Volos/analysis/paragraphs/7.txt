Friends and comrades, but now we have Mr. Tsipras who has bared his claws after the results of May 21st. He arrogantly insists on not acknowledging his share of responsibility for the increase in the numbers of New Democracy. His opposition was a golden sponsor to Mr. Mitsotakis. Otherwise, it cannot be explained how a government with rampant corruption, state-sponsored cronyism, the tragedy of Tempi, huge inequalities, and growth for the few, instead of reducing its rates, could reach 40%. We are here so that New Democracy understands that there is another strong, credible force to oppose and clash with in a fruitful way for our national interests, social justice, and the hope and perspective of the Greek people.
