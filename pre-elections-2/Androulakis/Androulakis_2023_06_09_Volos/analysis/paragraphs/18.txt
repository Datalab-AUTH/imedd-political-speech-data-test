So, let's go and see why we are practically being lied to. It is stated that they do not want graduated dividend taxation. Firstly, up to 50,000, it remains at 5% as it is today. Does anyone have individual middle class dividends or even higher incomes? Individually, I am not talking about earnings. Profits are taxed at the same 2%. 100, 200,000, 300,000; I will just give you a figure. In order to receive dividends of â‚¬150,000, one must have one and a half million euros of OTE shares, dear friends. Therefore, you understand that this only concerns 0.0 something of the Greek population. We are also accused of saying that the tax-free parental allowance should not exceed EUR 4.8 million. I do not know many middle class people who have 4 million euro villas and want to give tax-free gifts to their children. So, how about increasing it to 800,000 for both parents and covering the middle class, the weak in mobile and real estate, and not the powerful friends of Mr. Mitsotakis? That is tax justice. And as much as we are honored, we will strengthen the word of truth with the word of social justice.
