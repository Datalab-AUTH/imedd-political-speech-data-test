Our program has nothing to do with the program of New Democracy because quite simply the plan of New Democracy is to dismantle the welfare state. Our priority is the regeneration of the welfare state. They serve 1000 families fiscally; otherwise, we cannot explain their asymmetrical reaction to our reasonable proposals for a fair tax system, proposals that have been implemented in all modern European states. They insult the institutions. We are the party that built the independent authorities.
