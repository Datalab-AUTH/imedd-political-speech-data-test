But I did not expect Mr Tsipras' self-criticism for his defeat by New Democracy. He says that it is the fault of PASOK, the KKE, and the lack of simple proportional representation, but there was no simple proportional representation in 2019 when he was defeated in the European, national, and municipal elections. And if it weren't for Stavros Arnaoutakis in Crete, all of Greece would be blue with 13 regions in the new democracy. So what happened was not a new scenario, it was the sequence of SYRIZA's defeats against the new democracy. That is why Mr Mitsotakis has been pampered and is trying to keep Mr Tsipras upright. We are here to consign both of them to the dustbin of history because they have created division. They are not investing in the unity of the Greek people, they are not investing in national understanding in a fruitful public debate, but in the toxic gangs of the Internet who want a divided people and not a people ready to discuss their problems and provide reasonable solutions.
