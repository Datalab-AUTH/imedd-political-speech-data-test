Friends, in the agricultural sector, PASOK was the party that changed the countryside and gave dignity to the Greek farmer in the 1980s. It is the party that gave opportunities for agricultural production to develop and reduce the huge inequalities in the countryside that existed. In recent years, successive governments have failed to address the rising cost of production, leaving thousands of farmers to their fate. The rural population has fallen by 260,000 people, and the area under cultivation has decreased by six and a half million hectares in just 10 years. Around EUR 1.3 billion in agricultural income was lost. Additionally, 70% of our farmers have debts to public funds, EAFRD, and banks. Tens of thousands of farmers and 727 cooperatives have transferred their red loans, not by their own choice, to other banks and funds due to the 2015 law from the Agricultural Bank. The threat of foreclosures is stronger than ever. It is what I said earlier: the danger of the de-farming of our production. The cost of production in one year has increased by 22.4%. What do we propose? Measures to reduce production costs, especially for agricultural inputs, with zero excise duty on agricultural oil for the duration of the energy crisis. Today, I met producers in the Larissa cooperative, and we discussed the problems of production costs for kiwi. The same applies to other products.
