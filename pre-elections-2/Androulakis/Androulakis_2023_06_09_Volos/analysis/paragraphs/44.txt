Friends, PASOK is here not to double its seats in Parliament, but to embrace your aspirations, those of your children and grandchildren, and to make our country a united people once again. Together, let us raise the sun over Greece - the sun of the Democratic Party, the sun of hope, the sun of dignity. The patriotic movement of Andreas Papandreou sends a message of victory from Volos to all of Greece. Be well and strong, and fight. There are 15 days left - 15 days and nights of struggle. On June 25th, there will be a great victory against the forces of maintenance, populism, and toxicity. Bless you and thank you for your warm presence here in Volos. Be well, strong, and ready to fight. Victory is near - fight, fight, fight for the party of democracy, the party of rebirth, the party of social justice. Be well and strong!
