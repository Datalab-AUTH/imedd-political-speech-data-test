We are a historical progressive force that has no field of convergence with New Democracy. Based on the result of the popular verdict, according to the electoral system and the result of Sunday's elections, Mr. Mitsotakis would have 172 seats. What is more dangerous is the omnipotence of New Democracy, not the false blackmail of New Democracy for elections in August. PASOK is here, united and strong, to put a damper on the omnipotence of the conservative party. Even if Mr. Mitsotakis is surprised at the ballot box on June 25th, which we wish from the bottom of our hearts, he has other partners in the political system. Additionally, he has the political children of Karatzaferis, Mr. Voridis, Mr. Georgiades, and Mr. Plevris in the top three ministries. Mr. Karatzaferis has recently been openly supporting him, and even a few days ago, Faelos Kranidiotis was in the strategic plan of support for New Democracy. Since all these people are close to you, Mr. Mitsotakis, take Mr. Velopoulos as well, so that you can fix the right-wing and far-right house and let this progressive democratic party embrace the anxieties of the Greek people for a just society, for a society that gives prospects to new generations.
