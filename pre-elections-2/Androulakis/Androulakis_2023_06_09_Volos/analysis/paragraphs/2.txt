We have seen in the last few days the new Republic reveal a callous attitude towards the national health system, albeit a day late. Mr. Mitsotakis has removed Mr. Pneuma from his ballot papers, not because of his unacceptable and cynical statements, but because he testified that the devaluation and deconstruction of the national health system is a choice of the New Democracy. We have a duty to put a stop to this choice, which increases inequalities at the expense of the middle class and the weakest Greeks. This was not the first statement. Mr. Skertsos, in the midst of the pandemic, stated that there is no need to create a luxury health system. They also had in their program that they should aim for 7 to 10 minutes in the arrival of the ambulance for each incident, which is in this year's program of the New Democracy. This shows that they know the problem very well, but they did nothing to use the funds of the Recovery Fund to strengthen the national health system, resulting in the tragic events experienced by the Greek people in recent days in Kos and, of course, in Athens.
