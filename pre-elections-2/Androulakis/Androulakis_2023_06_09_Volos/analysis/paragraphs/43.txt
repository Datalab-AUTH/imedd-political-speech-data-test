Friends and comrades, with only the service of the people and the homeland as our compass, I invite you here in Volos to take on the struggle, the effort of the rebirth of the Democratic Party in your hands. If we fight united on June 25th, PASOK will be the modern center-left, the true representative of every democrat, of every progressive Greek. The time has come for this party to break the vicious circle of unworthiness and opacity. It is time for this party to build a new relationship of trust with the Greek people, those who abhor the current party system, and you can be sure that this is its top priority. PASOK must become the party of the younger generations again. Already on the first Sunday, we doubled our percentages among the younger generations. We have a duty, as in '74, to be in the vanguard of progress against maintenance for your children and grandchildren. We have a debt to make this a movement across the country. Friends, the struggle is not easy, we must not become complacent. Take the effort in your hands, and I pledge here from Volos that we will not disappoint any Greek woman or Greek man. Power to PASOK is power to the middle class and to the most vulnerable Greeks. So let us go together to raise the sun high above Greece. Let us go together to give social justice and national dignity. On June 25th, we give dignity, hope, and perspective to every Greek woman and every Greek man. Let's go together. Proudly raise the green flag of PASOK, and here from Volos, from Magnesia, from Thessaly, we are sending a message of victory to all of Greece. On June 25th, PASOK is reborn as a democratic party and becomes the main opponent of the right and of the country's maintenance.
