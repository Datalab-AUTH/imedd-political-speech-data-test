That is why I call on all citizens of the left and centre-left to join us in this new path to rebuild our house, the house of the Democratic Party, the house of progress and hope, the house that is the real opponent of the right and maintenance. We are ready, come June 25, to join hands, embrace the anxieties of the Greek people, and refound the party of Andreas Papandreou with a strong popular verdict. Friends, in this new era and new course, we have a duty not to disappoint any Greek woman or man. I pledge here from Volos that together we will build a new course of political ethics, political consistency, and a relationship of trust with all Greeks, without populism, big talk, grand speeches, or corruption that hurts the younger generations.
