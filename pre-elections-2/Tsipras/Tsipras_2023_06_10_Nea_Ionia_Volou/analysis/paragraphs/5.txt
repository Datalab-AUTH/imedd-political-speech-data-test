Now, however, things are different. Every vote counts on June 25th, either for the new democracy of self-reliance and omnipotence or for the reversal of the correlations that only SYRIZA can demand. Or in favor of the possibility of a strong force the next day that can look Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy in the eye, in its anti-social program. And speaking of programs, let us talk about programs. The previous election debate focused on what happened in 2015, as if the history of the country started on January 15th and ended on September 15th, neither on what happened before nor what happened after, especially not at all on what happened in the 4 years of Mitsotakis' government 19-23 and not at all on what will happen in the next 4 years. So we want to focus the debate today on what happened in those 4 years and what we are asking for in the next 4 years. Because it is in the final and crucial election that our lives will be decided for the next 4 years. Who and with what program will govern us for the next 4 years. And we see that the new democracy has a fraudulent program. A program where it says a lot of things that it doesn't plan to do and it doesn't say things, it hides things, that it plans to do.
