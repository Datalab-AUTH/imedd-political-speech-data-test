Here's why we're going to get goosebumps: Mr. Spiritual now comes along and says hospitals are private legal entities. Healthcare is an expensive thing for the state to support. Partnerships with private individuals and screening of patients whenever the costs are not coming in. Those who do not have a positive prognosis should not have their treatments wasted by the state. Cancer patients who do not have a positive prognosis should not have money wasted on their treatments by the state. Those who can afford it should go to private hospitals. Those who cannot afford it, we cannot do anything differently. What was it that another New Republic minister said? Those who cannot survive, die. This is their cruel, cynical logic. Look at what has happened in the last few days: three consecutive days with three losses of our fellow human beings because while we asked for 18 ambulances, we got 143 new ambulances, but there are no staff. Why is there no staff? Because despite being under the memoranda, we had 300 rescuer recruitments in the ambulance service. Four years of Mitsotakis and not one permanent recruitment, with 560 rescuers leaving. That's why people are dying, because they don't have an ambulance to come and pick them up in time and take them to a hospital.
