SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is not a flash in the pan, precisely because it expresses and represents the interests of ordinary people, the people of New Ionia in Volos, and every popular neighborhood in our homeland, where people breathe, live, and struggle for a better tomorrow. We know from our own history and roots that it is allowed to fall, but it is imperative to get up and fight. We also know that the only losers are those who do not fight, and that is why we will fight this struggle with momentum, determination, courage, and optimism until the last second to overturn these correlations. We will not give up this fight for our party's interests. We want to fight, and we will fight. We want to fight, and we will fight until the last second to overturn these correlations expressed at the ballot box in May. Not for our party's narrow interests, but because if they are repeated, it will be a very negative development, first of all for society and for democracy itself.
