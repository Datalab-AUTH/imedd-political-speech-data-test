We want to prevent the continuation of this huge income redistribution from the few to the many, as well as the redistribution of property - the largest since the Second World War - which is about to take place through the auctions of first homes and agricultural land. 40 billion euros and 700,000 mortgages have been passed on to the funds, which are now preparing to auction off citizens. These images, which we have seen fleetingly because the media does not show them, such as the elderly disabled man in Halkidiki who was left out of his house because he was a guarantor on the loan of his unemployed son, or the single-parent family in Upper Petrelona who were left out of their house, will become images of our daily life in the next 4 years.
