So, friends, we say that the complete dismantling of the NHS is a choice and a plan. It is a choice and a plan because even health is seen as a field of speculation. Let me give you one more number because I like to speak in a well-founded way. Greece is the country with the highest expenditure in the European Union in terms of private expenditure on healthcare. 35% of the expenditure is private expenditure. The average in the European Union is 15%. Public per capita health expenditure in Greece is two times lower than the European average. What does this mean? That they want to create a huge speculative space for funds and interests in the health sector. Private hospitals are growing like mushrooms, and public hospitals are being devalued, and the citizen will have to pay out of his or her pocket to have decent health conditions. We, therefore, say that justice, a fair society, and prosperity for all mean a national health system accessible to every citizen regardless of his or her financial capacity.
