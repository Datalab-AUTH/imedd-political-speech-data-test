Yes, we are aiming for a winning result in these elections because SYRIZA has not been and will not become a complementary party that complements the right, like KINAL. It is and will remain a party of power and wants to govern the country to implement its program for the benefit of the people. It is true that we are stuck in a decades-old vision of the left, a vision to change the political system, to have fairness even in voting, and for every vote to count equally. Unfortunately, blackmailing dilemmas are being reintroduced with the enhanced proportional representation. This was our vision, and we wanted to put it into practice with altruism because as a party in power, we had nothing to lose by remaining in the enhanced proportional representation. Simple proportional representation unfortunately did not go ahead. It suffered a historic defeat, and all the progressive forces are responsible for this historic defeat because throughout the election period, we gave them the hand of cooperation. Instead of wanting to reach out our hand to bring down the right, they wanted to cut off our hand and fought a one-front struggle against SYRIZA, not against Mitsotakis.
