These are our values, and they are priceless. We will fight for these values no matter the cost, and we will fight to the end to defend life, dignity, hope, selflessness, and justice. So let's go hard, and I ask you in the next 15 days until the ballot box, not only to maintain our optimism but to fight this battle with greater momentum and be reborn. We will be strong both at the ballot box and in the struggles of the next day, and we will move forward with society and fight for rights and values. Right is on our side, and whoever is right will win. Hello! Bless you! Good strength!
