What are their plans hiding? Their plans are not just to be self-reliant, but to be all-powerful, to have a constitutional revision with 180 MPs, they said. To continue a plan of social plunder that they are hiding, but it is slowly revealing itself. So I would like to call on every progressive citizen from here in the new Ionia of Volos, because not only did 40% of New Democracy go to the ballot box, but also 60% went to other parties. Every progressive citizen who has realized that what is coming, if this correlation is repeated, will be dramatic for society. I would like to say that objectively now, with the simple proportional representation, which does not exist and is enhanced, objectively with the enhanced proportional representation, which gives 50 bonus seats to the first party, every vote that does not go to the New Democracy or does not go to Syriza will be a vote that objectively suits and strengthens the New Democracy. We therefore call on all progressive citizens, despite their disagreements and reservations, to strengthen in this ballot box of enhanced proportional representation... What should we do? It was not our choice to strengthen the only alternative force, the only alternative programmatic project against the social plundering project of the New Democracy, to strengthen SYRIZA. To have a hope of reversing this correlation and winning.
