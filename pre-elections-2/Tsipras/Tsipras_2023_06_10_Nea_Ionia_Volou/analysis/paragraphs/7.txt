But what are they not saying and what are they aiming to do? The masks have fallen, and Mitsotakis' hidden health plan has been revealed. Their MP and MP candidate, Professor Pneumatikos, revealed it by saying exactly what Mr. Mitsotakis himself told us in Parliament during the debate on the 2020 budget on December 19. He said, "You will shudder at the program that we intend to implement in healthcare." What was this program? The privatization of hospitals. Mitsotakis wanted to convert three large public hospitals into PPPs with private legal entities on a pilot basis, put managers in, and cut costs.
