They submitted the medium-term program for the next three years to the European Commission two months ago. They did not include any of the announcements they made during the election because there is no budgetary space to include them. In other words, they are using these subsidies to cover the budgetary space, which they are giving out specifically to keep prices high for the energy, refining, and supermarket cartels. That is why all of Mitsotakis' promises about tax cuts and supporting society are false and illusory because they have not been included in the medium-term program submitted to the European Commission.
