But I want to end by saying that they talk about profits and losses, numbers and billions. And who are they talking to? To us, who know very well what the numbers will say. We are the only government in the country that left the coffers full, regulated the public debt, took the country out of the memoranda, and left 40 billion. Meanwhile, the party that left the country with a 15% deficit in 2009 and empty coffers in 2015. But so be it, they talk numbers, and we talk costs.
