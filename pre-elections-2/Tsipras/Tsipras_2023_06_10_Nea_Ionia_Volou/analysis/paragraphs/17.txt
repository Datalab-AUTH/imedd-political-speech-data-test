Today, I want to publicly ask myself before you: How much is human life really worth? How much is the life of the woman who ran away like a dog in the back of a farm truck really worth? How much is the life of the woman who lost her life because the ambulance was five hours late? How much is the life of the worker in Perama who lost his life because we no longer have a labor inspection body, and there is no control over safety conditions at work, and employers do as they please? What is the cost of life? What is the cost of dignity? What is the cost of safety? What is the cost of solidarity?
