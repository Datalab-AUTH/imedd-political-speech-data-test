Hello, thank you very much for the warm welcome here in Nea Ionia, Volos. This is where our roots are, in the city of refugees, in the neighborhood of refugees, in the neighborhood of daily struggle for survival. As soon as I stopped in front of the church, a priest was waiting for me and said, "Welcome to the place where the left always recharges its batteries, because here are the people who suffer and struggle." That is why we are here today, in front of the monument to EPON, which reminds us that in this land, nothing has been given away. Everything was won through struggle, and so are we today. We continue the struggle alongside society, alongside the people of toil, alongside the people of creation. Because, my friends, Syriza Progressive Alliance is a child of necessity, a mature child of necessity, and it has come to stay forever next to the people, next to society, next to the underprivileged, next to the workers, next to the people of toil, to serve and fight for their interests.
