Mr Mitsotakis has asked us, and I close with this, to cost our programs. When I said to him, "Let's finally go, stop the speculation, we will cost them, but let's also go on television in an open public debate and talk about our programs," he ran away once again. He has once again run away because he has no arguments and because his program is false and deceptive, but also because our program is realistic, costed, and feasible.
