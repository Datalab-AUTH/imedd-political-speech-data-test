We call on Greek citizens to go to the ballot box on June 25th with the programs that are being opposed. What are the alternatives for our lives and who are the ones who will fight until the last moment with a concern for social justice? Who are the ones who will fight once again to make the rich richer and the poor poorer? This is the crucial stake of the ballot box. In this ballot box of enhanced proportional representation, I repeat, nothing has been decided before it is finally decided. No race is lost. If you don't give up, the race is not lost. We have to fight, give it our all, and win the fight. We will fight it to the last moment.
