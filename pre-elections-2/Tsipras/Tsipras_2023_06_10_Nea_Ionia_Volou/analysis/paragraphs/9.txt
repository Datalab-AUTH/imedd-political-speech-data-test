Why? Because during these past 4 years, Mitsotakis' strategic choice was not to strengthen the national health system, and he had no lack of financial possibilities. I will give you an example. In December 2019, we had a total of 108,000 serving, permanent, and contract doctors, nurses, and administrative staff in the NHS. After the pandemic, 6 months ago, in December 2022, that number had become 84,000. This frightening reduction in the number of employees serving in the NHS reflects and proves that it was a strategic choice of Mr. Mitsotakis to leave the NHS in complete disarray.
