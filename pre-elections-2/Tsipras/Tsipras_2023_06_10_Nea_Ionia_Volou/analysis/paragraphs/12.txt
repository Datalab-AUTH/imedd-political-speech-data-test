This is the major issue of the election, along with issues of inaccuracy, income theft, labor, and education, and we must finally address them. We are calling for and have a plan to combat income theft by taxing excessive profits from obscenity. Mr. Mitsotakis does not want to touch these profits and is taxing all Greek citizens equally, but mainly burdening the so-called middle class, wage earners, workers, and the vulnerable. He claims he has not imposed any new taxes, but the truth is that in the last 16 months, he has imposed an additional 6 billion in taxes on Greek citizens, keeping VAT high. How can we address inaccuracy when we are running out of benefits? Only by reducing value-added tax, reducing excise duty, abolishing excise duty for farmers and livestock farmers, increasing wages, and implementing market controls. Only in this way can we protect the income of the middle class and the poor, and this is SYRIZA's plan and program.
