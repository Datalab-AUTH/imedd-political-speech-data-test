Hello, thank you very much for the warm welcome here in Nea Ionia, Volos. This is where our roots are, in the city of refugees, in the neighborhood of refugees, in the neighborhood of daily struggle for survival. As soon as I stopped in front of the church, a priest was waiting for me and said, "Welcome to the place where the left always recharges its batteries, because here are the people who suffer and struggle." That is why we are here today, in front of the monument to EPON, which reminds us that in this land, nothing has been given away. Everything was won through struggle, and so are we today. We continue the struggle alongside society, alongside the people of toil, alongside the people of creation. Because, my friends, Syriza Progressive Alliance is a child of necessity, a mature child of necessity, and it has come to stay forever next to the people, next to society, next to the underprivileged, next to the workers, next to the people of toil, to serve and fight for their interests.

SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is not a flash in the pan, precisely because it expresses and represents the interests of ordinary people, the people of New Ionia in Volos, and every popular neighborhood in our homeland, where people breathe, live, and struggle for a better tomorrow. We know from our own history and roots that it is allowed to fall, but it is imperative to get up and fight. We also know that the only losers are those who do not fight, and that is why we will fight this struggle with momentum, determination, courage, and optimism until the last second to overturn these correlations. We will not give up this fight for our party's interests. We want to fight, and we will fight. We want to fight, and we will fight until the last second to overturn these correlations expressed at the ballot box in May. Not for our party's narrow interests, but because if they are repeated, it will be a very negative development, first of all for society and for democracy itself.

What are their plans hiding? Their plans are not just to be self-reliant, but to be all-powerful, to have a constitutional revision with 180 MPs, they said. To continue a plan of social plunder that they are hiding, but it is slowly revealing itself. So I would like to call on every progressive citizen from here in the new Ionia of Volos, because not only did 40% of New Democracy go to the ballot box, but also 60% went to other parties. Every progressive citizen who has realized that what is coming, if this correlation is repeated, will be dramatic for society. I would like to say that objectively now, with the simple proportional representation, which does not exist and is enhanced, objectively with the enhanced proportional representation, which gives 50 bonus seats to the first party, every vote that does not go to the New Democracy or does not go to Syriza will be a vote that objectively suits and strengthens the New Democracy. We therefore call on all progressive citizens, despite their disagreements and reservations, to strengthen in this ballot box of enhanced proportional representation... What should we do? It was not our choice to strengthen the only alternative force, the only alternative programmatic project against the social plundering project of the New Democracy, to strengthen SYRIZA. To have a hope of reversing this correlation and winning.

Yes, we are aiming for a winning result in these elections because SYRIZA has not been and will not become a complementary party that complements the right, like KINAL. It is and will remain a party of power and wants to govern the country to implement its program for the benefit of the people. It is true that we are stuck in a decades-old vision of the left, a vision to change the political system, to have fairness even in voting, and for every vote to count equally. Unfortunately, blackmailing dilemmas are being reintroduced with the enhanced proportional representation. This was our vision, and we wanted to put it into practice with altruism because as a party in power, we had nothing to lose by remaining in the enhanced proportional representation. Simple proportional representation unfortunately did not go ahead. It suffered a historic defeat, and all the progressive forces are responsible for this historic defeat because throughout the election period, we gave them the hand of cooperation. Instead of wanting to reach out our hand to bring down the right, they wanted to cut off our hand and fought a one-front struggle against SYRIZA, not against Mitsotakis.

Now, however, things are different. Every vote counts on June 25th, either for the new democracy of self-reliance and omnipotence or for the reversal of the correlations that only SYRIZA can demand. Or in favor of the possibility of a strong force the next day that can look Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy in the eye, in its anti-social program. And speaking of programs, let us talk about programs. The previous election debate focused on what happened in 2015, as if the history of the country started on January 15th and ended on September 15th, neither on what happened before nor what happened after, especially not at all on what happened in the 4 years of Mitsotakis' government 19-23 and not at all on what will happen in the next 4 years. So we want to focus the debate today on what happened in those 4 years and what we are asking for in the next 4 years. Because it is in the final and crucial election that our lives will be decided for the next 4 years. Who and with what program will govern us for the next 4 years. And we see that the new democracy has a fraudulent program. A program where it says a lot of things that it doesn't plan to do and it doesn't say things, it hides things, that it plans to do.

They submitted the medium-term program for the next three years to the European Commission two months ago. They did not include any of the announcements they made during the election because there is no budgetary space to include them. In other words, they are using these subsidies to cover the budgetary space, which they are giving out specifically to keep prices high for the energy, refining, and supermarket cartels. That is why all of Mitsotakis' promises about tax cuts and supporting society are false and illusory because they have not been included in the medium-term program submitted to the European Commission.

But what are they not saying and what are they aiming to do? The masks have fallen, and Mitsotakis' hidden health plan has been revealed. Their MP and MP candidate, Professor Pneumatikos, revealed it by saying exactly what Mr. Mitsotakis himself told us in Parliament during the debate on the 2020 budget on December 19. He said, "You will shudder at the program that we intend to implement in healthcare." What was this program? The privatization of hospitals. Mitsotakis wanted to convert three large public hospitals into PPPs with private legal entities on a pilot basis, put managers in, and cut costs.

It didn't proceed because of the pandemic. The pandemic arrived and we witnessed the consequences for the country, including the devaluation of the NHS. Unfortunately, Greece has the highest number of deaths in proportion to its population in all of Europe.

Why? Because during these past 4 years, Mitsotakis' strategic choice was not to strengthen the national health system, and he had no lack of financial possibilities. I will give you an example. In December 2019, we had a total of 108,000 serving, permanent, and contract doctors, nurses, and administrative staff in the NHS. After the pandemic, 6 months ago, in December 2022, that number had become 84,000. This frightening reduction in the number of employees serving in the NHS reflects and proves that it was a strategic choice of Mr. Mitsotakis to leave the NHS in complete disarray.

Here's why we're going to get goosebumps: Mr. Spiritual now comes along and says hospitals are private legal entities. Healthcare is an expensive thing for the state to support. Partnerships with private individuals and screening of patients whenever the costs are not coming in. Those who do not have a positive prognosis should not have their treatments wasted by the state. Cancer patients who do not have a positive prognosis should not have money wasted on their treatments by the state. Those who can afford it should go to private hospitals. Those who cannot afford it, we cannot do anything differently. What was it that another New Republic minister said? Those who cannot survive, die. This is their cruel, cynical logic. Look at what has happened in the last few days: three consecutive days with three losses of our fellow human beings because while we asked for 18 ambulances, we got 143 new ambulances, but there are no staff. Why is there no staff? Because despite being under the memoranda, we had 300 rescuer recruitments in the ambulance service. Four years of Mitsotakis and not one permanent recruitment, with 560 rescuers leaving. That's why people are dying, because they don't have an ambulance to come and pick them up in time and take them to a hospital.

So, friends, we say that the complete dismantling of the NHS is a choice and a plan. It is a choice and a plan because even health is seen as a field of speculation. Let me give you one more number because I like to speak in a well-founded way. Greece is the country with the highest expenditure in the European Union in terms of private expenditure on healthcare. 35% of the expenditure is private expenditure. The average in the European Union is 15%. Public per capita health expenditure in Greece is two times lower than the European average. What does this mean? That they want to create a huge speculative space for funds and interests in the health sector. Private hospitals are growing like mushrooms, and public hospitals are being devalued, and the citizen will have to pay out of his or her pocket to have decent health conditions. We, therefore, say that justice, a fair society, and prosperity for all mean a national health system accessible to every citizen regardless of his or her financial capacity.

This is the major issue of the election, along with issues of inaccuracy, income theft, labor, and education, and we must finally address them. We are calling for and have a plan to combat income theft by taxing excessive profits from obscenity. Mr. Mitsotakis does not want to touch these profits and is taxing all Greek citizens equally, but mainly burdening the so-called middle class, wage earners, workers, and the vulnerable. He claims he has not imposed any new taxes, but the truth is that in the last 16 months, he has imposed an additional 6 billion in taxes on Greek citizens, keeping VAT high. How can we address inaccuracy when we are running out of benefits? Only by reducing value-added tax, reducing excise duty, abolishing excise duty for farmers and livestock farmers, increasing wages, and implementing market controls. Only in this way can we protect the income of the middle class and the poor, and this is SYRIZA's plan and program.

We want to prevent the continuation of this huge income redistribution from the few to the many, as well as the redistribution of property - the largest since the Second World War - which is about to take place through the auctions of first homes and agricultural land. 40 billion euros and 700,000 mortgages have been passed on to the funds, which are now preparing to auction off citizens. These images, which we have seen fleetingly because the media does not show them, such as the elderly disabled man in Halkidiki who was left out of his house because he was a guarantor on the loan of his unemployed son, or the single-parent family in Upper Petrelona who were left out of their house, will become images of our daily life in the next 4 years.

We call on Greek citizens to go to the ballot box on June 25th with the programs that are being opposed. What are the alternatives for our lives and who are the ones who will fight until the last moment with a concern for social justice? Who are the ones who will fight once again to make the rich richer and the poor poorer? This is the crucial stake of the ballot box. In this ballot box of enhanced proportional representation, I repeat, nothing has been decided before it is finally decided. No race is lost. If you don't give up, the race is not lost. We have to fight, give it our all, and win the fight. We will fight it to the last moment.

Mr Mitsotakis has asked us, and I close with this, to cost our programs. When I said to him, "Let's finally go, stop the speculation, we will cost them, but let's also go on television in an open public debate and talk about our programs," he ran away once again. He has once again run away because he has no arguments and because his program is false and deceptive, but also because our program is realistic, costed, and feasible.

But I want to end by saying that they talk about profits and losses, numbers and billions. And who are they talking to? To us, who know very well what the numbers will say. We are the only government in the country that left the coffers full, regulated the public debt, took the country out of the memoranda, and left 40 billion. Meanwhile, the party that left the country with a 15% deficit in 2009 and empty coffers in 2015. But so be it, they talk numbers, and we talk costs.

Today, I want to publicly ask myself before you: How much is human life really worth? How much is the life of the woman who ran away like a dog in the back of a farm truck really worth? How much is the life of the woman who lost her life because the ambulance was five hours late? How much is the life of the worker in Perama who lost his life because we no longer have a labor inspection body, and there is no control over safety conditions at work, and employers do as they please? What is the cost of life? What is the cost of dignity? What is the cost of safety? What is the cost of solidarity?

These are our values, and they are priceless. We will fight for these values no matter the cost, and we will fight to the end to defend life, dignity, hope, selflessness, and justice. So let's go hard, and I ask you in the next 15 days until the ballot box, not only to maintain our optimism but to fight this battle with greater momentum and be reborn. We will be strong both at the ballot box and in the struggles of the next day, and we will move forward with society and fight for rights and values. Right is on our side, and whoever is right will win. Hello! Bless you! Good strength!
