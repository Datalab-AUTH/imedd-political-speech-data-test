Dear friends, reversing the course of divergence of the country from the European average in terms of social cohesion and doing so in a socially just way is the real national goal for which it is worth fighting in the next four years. If this course of divergence continues, the country will once again face existential economic, social, and geopolitical dilemmas. Our party has done its duty to get us out of the crisis, and today, the dilemma that existed 8 years ago about whether we would stay in Europe is no longer on the horizon. However, there is an urgent question of whether we will finally become Europe or remain the poor tail. To do so requires a different plan and different recipes from those that led us into the crisis 14 years ago.
