Step Three: Putting workers and the right to work at the center. Labor for us is not just a factor of production. It is at the heart of the economy because only labor produces wealth, and this wealth must be shared. Our aim is to reform the labor market, to make workers feel powerful and secure. The state, in our conception, cannot simply act as an observer of promiscuity. It must and will set rules to eliminate precarious, uninsured, black labor and to strengthen the bargaining position of workers for better wages and humane working conditions. A just society means rules at work, and prosperity for all will only come with job security, better jobs, and better wages.
