They will again mobilise all their communication machinery not to discuss our proposals, but to convince us that the numbers don't add up. Who? Those who left the country in 2009 with a 15% deficit, do they know best how the numbers come out? Those who have bankrupted their party and owe EUR 400 million to the banks, both borrowed and unpaid, do they know how the figures come out? And those who got the country out of the crisis, that is to say us, do not know. We left 37 billion in the public coffers, we regulated the public debt, we left the country with its head out of the water. We don't know how the numbers come out. They know better. We will hear again about general accounts, about costing, about expenditure and revenue. Even though when we challenged them, because they were circulating an old excel sheet from their computer and they were supposedly saying it had the GAO stamp on it. And when we challenged them to go along and cost our program and their program, they ran away, they refused.
