Where the wealth produced will grow and be shared fairly and equitably among citizens. It will not be accumulated by a few select business groups. A country and society that are constantly developing their productive potential, that have exploited their comparative advantages, that are confident and secure. It is the image of a country with strong institutions, entrenched democracy, and a strong welfare state. With workers who are better paid for their work, in dignity and security. A country where workers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs will not be taxed to enrich the oligarchy but will share equally and proportionately in the common burdens.
