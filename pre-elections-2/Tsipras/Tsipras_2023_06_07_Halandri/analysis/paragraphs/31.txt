Step Five: Strengthening public education. We commit to providing quality public and free schools and universities, as well as public and free postgraduate education. We will increase spending and permanently recruit teachers to finally solve the huge problem of substitutes, which is 5% throughout Europe but 30% in Greece. Education, whether it be school, university, or technical, is not a privilege for us. It is a right of our children and an obligation of the state to provide it free of charge to all children. It is a prerequisite for progress and prosperity, as well as democracy and civilization. Solidarity and respect.
