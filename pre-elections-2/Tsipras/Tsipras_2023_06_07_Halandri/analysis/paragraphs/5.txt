I want, and we want, to live in a country where a young couple can have children whenever they want and can cope with the costs of the supermarket, rent, mortgage, and utilities. We want a country where they will have free access to nursery care, healthcare, quality, and modern schools. We want to live in a country where a young scientist can choose whether to stay, work, and contribute her knowledge and energy to the collective effort for the common good, and not be forced to emigrate to see her efforts rewarded.
