But I ask: How much is the life of the 63-year-old woman who perished in the back of a rural car in Kos two days ago really worth? How much is the life of the worker who died a week ago in Perama? How much is the life of the 19-year-old pregnant woman who died yesterday after waiting for five hours for an ambulance in Nea Makri? How much does equality really cost? How much does safety really cost? How much does dignity really cost? How much does the dignity of Greek women and men really cost? All of these, our values, are not free. But they are free of charge. Because they go beyond the cold logic of paying cash. They are values and principles of a society in which it is worth living. They are our principles and our values.
