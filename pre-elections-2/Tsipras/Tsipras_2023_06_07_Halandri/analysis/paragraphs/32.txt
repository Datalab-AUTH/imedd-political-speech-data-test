Step six: Creating conditions of security for all with strong social protection. For us, social welfare and state care are not only about extreme poverty. It concerns all citizens and aims to reduce inequalities and help those in need. It is one of the main tools for tackling the demographic problem. That is why we resolutely support mothers, take care of children, guarantee active social support for our disabled fellow citizens, and take care of the elderly with special measures of financial support and care services.
