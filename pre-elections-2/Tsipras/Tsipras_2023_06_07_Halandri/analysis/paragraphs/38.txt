We have chosen a side. And we will fight until the last moment. With modesty and determination. With real concern for people and society. Because we want a just society with prosperity for all and for all. And we will always fight until victory! Good strength. Thank you very much. We will always and in all circumstances and from whatever position until our eternal victory for a society of equality, prosperity, solidarity and justice. Goodbye!
