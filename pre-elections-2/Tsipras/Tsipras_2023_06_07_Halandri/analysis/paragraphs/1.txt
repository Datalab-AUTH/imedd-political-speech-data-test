We thank you all for your warm welcome and presence here in Chalandri today, in a program presentation that is different than usual, in an open outdoor space, but at a very critical juncture. We are only 18 days away from the elections on June 25th, and these elections are not just about deciding the government of the country tomorrow, the Prime Minister tomorrow, the parliamentary strength of the parties, or the composition of the parliament. In these elections, something much more important, something much bigger, something that concerns us all, is being decided. The very future of the country and its citizens is at stake. We are not just deciding who will be the winner and who will be the loser. We are deciding who and how the country will be governed over the next four years. Therefore, we are deciding on our future and our lives.
