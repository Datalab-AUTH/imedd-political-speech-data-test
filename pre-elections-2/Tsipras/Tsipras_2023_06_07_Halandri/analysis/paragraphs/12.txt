And while the Southwest took over the government for the first time in decades at a fiscally favorable time, unfortunately, it did not choose to seize the opportunity. Five years after the end of the adjustment programs, the country's per capita income is at 59% of the Eurozone average, 18 percentage points lower than the pre-crisis level of 77% in 2007. Countries that were in a much worse position than us in 2007 - Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovenia - have already surpassed us. At the same time, the percentage of citizens at risk of poverty is now 28.2%, a beastly figure. In other words, the threat of poverty is knocking at the door of one in three Greeks. It is the worst rate among all EU countries, matched only by Romania and Bulgaria. This deterioration of the country's position is reflected in the low wages of workers and the complete deregulation of the labor market.
