Friends, I have presented the main priorities: the seven steps of SYRIZA's plan for an inclusive, dynamic, green, and sustainable economy. It is a redistributive economy that guarantees equal access to goods and services for all. I know what the reactions will be. Those who have no intention of discussing our programs will create a distorted image of their credibility, questioning whether they are realistic or workable. What will they do once again? They will describe our program as expensive, utopian, and unworkable.
