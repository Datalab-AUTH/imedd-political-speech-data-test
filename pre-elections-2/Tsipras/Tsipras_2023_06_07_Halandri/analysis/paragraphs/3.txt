And let's ask ourselves together: What do we want our country to look like at the end of the next four years, in 2027? What do we want our society to look like in 2027 to make it worth living in? The image that comes to my mind is that of a country and a society of democracy and equality. We want ourselves and our children to live in 2027 in a country of democracy and equality, in a country and a society with dynamism and perspective, and in a country and a society with less inequality.
