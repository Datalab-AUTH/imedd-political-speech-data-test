The idea that prosperity will be spread to more people as wealth is concentrated in a few, as the latest data from the BoE showed us, where 0.7% of the rich hold 42% of bank deposits, is a dangerous idea and doomed to lead us to new crises. That is why this idea, this project must be defeated. And it must be defeated both at the polls and in the field of everyday political and ideological struggle. Indirect taxes must be reduced. No matter how much the representatives of the New Democracy Party, alone against the whole body of economists of all theoretical traditions and schools of thought worldwide, try to convince us that reducing indirect taxes favours the rich. No matter how hard they try to convince us that high indirect taxes favour the rich, they will not succeed, because the vast majority of the Greek people know. Six billion more in taxes were paid by Greeks in the last 16 months due to high indirect taxation. This is a huge redistribution of income from the many to the few. But it is not the only one.
