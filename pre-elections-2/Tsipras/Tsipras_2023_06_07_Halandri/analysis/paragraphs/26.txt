Step One: Reconstruct the productive and development model for just, sustainable, and green growth. Create a dynamic and outward-looking economy that breaks free from the trap of clientelism, privileged suppliers, and state-owned enterprises. Build an economy based on knowledge, innovation, a just green transition, and claiming its own share of the global division of labor. Redirect the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund and other financial instruments to primary production, manufacturing, digital transformation, critical public infrastructure, and research. Approximately 70 billion euros will be available over the next seven years, with 32 billion coming from the Recovery Fund and the rest from other European financial instruments. Create an economy that finally utilizes the country's highly qualified human resources, young scientists, skilled craftsmen, and the accumulated experience of farmers. Establish a banking system that works for the benefit of the real economy and bears the stamp of public intervention. Create a strong public pillar by regaining control of a systemic bank and giving a leading role to the Development Bank. The public pillar should direct competition to the benefit of the real economy, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which must finally gain access to liquidity.
