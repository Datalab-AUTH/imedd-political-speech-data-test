Step Four: Creating a new, strong NHS. The NHS is first and foremost its people - the people who fought through the pandemic in tragic circumstances. Workers who have gone beyond the limits of job exhaustion but are not paid commensurate with their contribution. These are the people we must support by increasing their salaries, recognizing the dangerous nature of their profession, and supporting and developing the infrastructure of the healthcare system in which they work. Of course, we must also give tenure to all those who have been on the front line of the battle. It is our moral duty, and our new national goal is convergence, which certainly goes through the regeneration and rebuilding of the NHS and its infrastructure. It is a shame for our country to compare our public hospitals with similar public structures in central Europe. Our top priority is to rebuild and reconstruct the NHS and make health services universally accessible and of high quality for all, regardless of their financial means.
