I would say that if there is a top major national goal for the next four years, and perhaps for the next decade, it is exactly that: the national goal to reverse the current trend of divergence and become a path of convergence again. Workers' wages and household income must be strengthened, and this cannot happen as long as precarious employment has become the norm and collective agreements are the exception. As long as the Labour Inspectorate has been abolished and employer impunity prevails, the idea that the economy will grow by reducing workers' real wages, dismantling labour relations, and cutting taxes for the fewest businesses is an idea doomed to failure.
