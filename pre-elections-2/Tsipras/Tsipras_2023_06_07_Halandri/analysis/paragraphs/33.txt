Step seven: We guarantee the right to decent housing and protect the first home. The housing problem will be the problem of the next decade, and immediate government intervention is required without further delay. I repeat what I said earlier: If the redistribution of real estate planned by the government and the funds at the expense of the vast social majority is not prevented, the result will be painful for society and irreversible. It will be painful because it will break up the cohesion of Greek society and cause enormous upheavals in the economy. There is no stability or economic growth with a broken society. We have a coherent and complete, realistic plan for the protection of first homes and access to quality housing. Our holistic plan includes the regulation of bank loans, with the possibility of legal recourse and a ban on auctions, as well as a package of measures to regulate property prices. This includes a restriction of Airbnb to individuals only, the creation of the Housing Bank, and a special rent subsidy program for young people.
