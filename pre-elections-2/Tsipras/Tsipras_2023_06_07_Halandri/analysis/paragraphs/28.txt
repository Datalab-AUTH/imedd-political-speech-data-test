Step Two: Boost income and protect purchasing power. We will address the problem of price stickiness that reduces household income by increasing disposable income and intervening in the price-setting arena. This will be achieved through wage increases in the public and private sectors, increases in all pensions, regulating debts to tax and social security funds, reducing the tax burden for the majority of the population, and ending the policy of feeding obscenity. We will tax the excess profits of energy companies and refineries, and cap their profits and retail prices. We will mobilize all state control mechanisms to break up cartels that hinder fair development and collective well-being. The reduction of prices must be enforced before household income is annihilated, as the Commission has already announced that subsidies and passes will soon stop. This is our plan, and it is what our constitution requires, which states that "Greeks shall contribute without discrimination to the public burdens, according to their strength." Everyone will contribute according to their strengths.
