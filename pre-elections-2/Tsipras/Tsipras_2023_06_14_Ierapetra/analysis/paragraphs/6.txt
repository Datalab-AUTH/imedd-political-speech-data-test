What is New Democracy's plan for the National Health System? It is, and I will say this without any doubt, the Pneumatiko plan. It is the plan that the New Democracy candidate for MP in Evia and former MP, a remarkable professor, revealed through his statements and forced Mr. Mitsotakis to pretend that he was taking it off the ballot paper. However, it has not been removed from the ballot paper. It was declared. What is the Pneumatiko plan? Is it the secret Mitsotakis plan that he had revealed? The pandemic came and he did not complete it. I want to remind you that during the debate of the December 20, 2019 budget in Parliament, just before the pandemic came in March 2020, Mr. Mitsotakis had told us that he was planning at that time to proceed with a pilot and later complete it in almost all hospitals.
