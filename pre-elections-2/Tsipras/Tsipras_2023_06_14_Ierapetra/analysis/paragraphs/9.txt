We have not forgotten that, but his plan did not materialize. He did not have time to materialize it, and he is now coming to put it forward and materialize it. The plan that they say, he said it himself, "we're going to cringe," and we did cringe at the statement from Pneuma, who talked about screening patients. Which is what? He said, "there is no way the public can cover healthcare costs. It is expensive healthcare. So, public hospitals will have to make cuts. They will have to close public facilities, and when a patient with a low life expectancy goes to get treatment that is expensive, we will choose who we give it to. We will give it to the one who has a longer life expectancy." But this is creepy. Isn't it just cynical and what is leading us to a society that will devalue the greatest value? What is the greatest value? Human life is the greatest value. We do not value benefit, profit, gain, and loss. Value is human life.
