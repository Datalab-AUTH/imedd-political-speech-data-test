Because New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis want one thing: to win. And not just to win, but to fragment the progressive vote so that they have no opponent the next day. So how much will it matter if parties that were set up by the Mitsotakis regime get into parliament? They were set up by the Mitsotakis regime. How important is it for someone to go from 7 to 8 or from 10 to 13? It is very important to reverse this correlation. It is of great importance to prevent the victory of an unpopular, anti-social programme such as that of New Democracy, and it is of great importance the next day to be present and to defend the rights of society. And we are committed to you. We will be present. We will be with you no matter what. Bless you!
