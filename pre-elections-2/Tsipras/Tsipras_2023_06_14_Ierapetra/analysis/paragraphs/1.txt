I want to thank you first of all for your presence and your warm welcome, which gives us all strength. It is a pleasure to be here again in Ierapetra, in Crete, and I want to address the great problems facing your society and the country. Your fellow citizens are facing these problems. We are a few days away from a crucial election, and this contest is taking place on different terms. First of all, because this time we have a contest that is certain to produce a government for the next four years. Whoever comes out first will govern for the next four years. It is not a showdown with the electoral system of simple proportional representation. It is a showdown with the system we have known for many, many years: the system of enhanced proportional representation. We had a vision to change the political system, to make it less toxic, and to make it fair and equal for every citizen to vote. That is why we introduced simple proportional representation.
