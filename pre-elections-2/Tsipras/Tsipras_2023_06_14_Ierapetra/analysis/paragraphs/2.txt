During the last election period, we initiated a debate on programmatic convergences and the necessary programmatic debate to ensure progressive governance in the future. However, other progressive forces chose to focus solely on expanding their own field rather than governing the country. They launched a one-sided attack on SYRIZA instead of examining who governed the country for the past four years and criticizing Mr. Mitsotakis and the New Democracy party. Today, the situation is completely different, and all citizens understand that they oppose the governance programs and power plans of Mr. Mitsotakis and Syriza.
