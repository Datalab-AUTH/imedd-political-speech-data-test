We have a plan for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship that involves debt adjustment, not tax increases. This is similar to what we did in 2018 with social security contributions for small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs. We provided a solution to write off part of the nominal value of the debt and allowed for 120 instalments for the remaining debt. Our goal is debt adjustment, not the closure or strangulation of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship.
