And I will tell you one last thing. In the next few months, there will be about 700,000 auctions coming up as 700,000 mortgages have gone through the banks and funds. They've put up a 19 billion guarantee. If the auctions do not take place, that is, the Greek government will pay 19 billion. We have tabled, and this is our programme, a framework of regulation, a fair regulation, to enable, with a legal framework that is compulsory for creditors, the regulations that will enable not only the weak but also the middle class who have a mortgage on their first home, their professional housing, their agricultural land, to go into viable arrangements that they will be able to afford to pay. The state will act as a helper to support these arrangements, subsidizing the installment of people who will be able to slowly repay their debts. And the funds will go for a generous haircut on their claims, not with 15-20% that the red loans have taken, wanting to get 100%.
