But since the programs are being contrasted, allow me to say a few words about the alternative programs of governance that are being put to the Greek people's judgment in view of the June 25th showdown. And I want to start with one that I think is fundamental, crucial. One that we have not given the attention it deserves in the debate leading up to the simple proportional representation elections. It's the healthcare issue, and let me start with that because I'm here in Hierapetra, in a place that I know all too well that local communities have fought to defend the city's public hospital, and I want to speak in the language of truth because we need to speak the language of truth. On the one hand, there is a plan, the SYRIZA plan, which wants to prioritize public health. We want a new strong national health system because our vision is that all citizens, regardless of their financial capacity, should have access to a health system that offers decent care and medical and pharmaceutical care to all Greeks. And to do this, we have planned to redistribute the resources of the Recovery Fund. The current government is only giving 2% for health. We have planned to boost the salaries of primary care doctors. We have plans to make permanent doctors and nurses who have been on the front line of the pandemic. We have plans to include nurses in the heavy and unhealthy category, to make 15,000 much-needed new hires for public hospitals.
