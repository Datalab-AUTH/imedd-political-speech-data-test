And so, in closing, I want to tell you two things. The first is this: The new republic has a program in which it makes promises that it has no intention of keeping, and it fails to mention the things it does plan to do. The promises it makes are not included in the medium-term program it submitted to Brussels. None of the promises that Mitsotakis has made are recorded in the plan he sent to Brussels two months ago, or even two years ago. He certainly doesn't openly discuss his plans. I previously mentioned issues such as public health, hospital closures, spending cuts, patient triage, and 700,000 auctions. These are not the things he is talking about.
