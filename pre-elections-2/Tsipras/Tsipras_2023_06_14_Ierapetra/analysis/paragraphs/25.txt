A profit cap should be imposed on energy companies to provide relief for the middle and lower classes. We should not have to pay for the wealthy's land. The excessive profits must stop. Therefore, we propose a tax on the 6 billion dollars of excess profits accumulated by energy and refining companies. We should decrease indirect taxes that affect everyone, but those with 6 billion in excess profits should contribute to funding social needs such as hospitals, schools, and welfare support.
