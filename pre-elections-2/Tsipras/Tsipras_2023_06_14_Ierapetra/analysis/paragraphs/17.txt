So we say that no matter how much it costs, human life is priceless and our top priority. Therefore, in this election, let us keep in mind that the most critical issue to discuss is how we will live in the next four years. We advocate for a strong National Health System, recruitment and staffing of the EHIC, primary health care, local health units, and hospitals that provide decent health care for all citizens, rather than the dismantling of the NHS as proposed by the New Democracy party.
