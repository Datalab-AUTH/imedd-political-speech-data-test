And I say this because in the last few days, we have seen a right-wing that cannot hide its arrogance and desire for power. They not only want to win the elections and be self-reliant, but they want to be an all-powerful regime. They intimidate and blackmail any social group that disagrees with them, and this is a message that concerns everyone, regardless of whether they vote for Syriza or even for New Democracy. What do we want for the future? Do we want an arrogant, uncontrollable government that functions as a regime of party and family power, or do we want a vibrant and healthy democracy? Do we want a force that can stand up to the government and defend society? This is a crucial question.
