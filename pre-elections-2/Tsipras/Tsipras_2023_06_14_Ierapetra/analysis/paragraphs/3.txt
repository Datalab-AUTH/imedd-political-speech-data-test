And I want to stress this: SYRIZA Progressive Alliance was, is, and will remain a party of power, not a party of protest or a complement to the governance of the right. The fragmentation of the progressive vote led to a negative result on May 21st, but I will borrow a phrase that Mr. Mitsotakis likes, and here is something we agree on: on June 25th, the ballot box will be empty, and the criterion of the vote will be which program and who will govern us for the next four years. New Democracy or SYRIZA, a progressive alliance? So we are going into this election with one goal, a party in power cannot have another goal. With the aim of bringing a winning result, with the aim of overturning the unfavorable correlations recorded in the ballot box of the simple proportional representation. And in any case, we believe that this is as useful for society as it is crucial for democracy. It is a question of the stability of the political system and the health of democracy itself.
