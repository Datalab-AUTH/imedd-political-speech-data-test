But why do I say that this is critical for Ierapetra and your local community? I mention health not only because you have fought to keep your hospital alive, but also because the hospital of Ierapetra is first on the list to be closed in the implementation of the Mitsotakis-Pneimatikos plan. The first public health facility to be closed is the prefecture of Lasithi. Why? Because it has three hospitals. There are many. We should build more private hospitals, but not three public hospitals.
