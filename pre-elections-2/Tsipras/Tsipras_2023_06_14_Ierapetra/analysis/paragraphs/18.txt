Let me mention 2-3 additional critical issues regarding small and medium-sized businesses. New Democracy has a plan, the Pissarides plan. What did the Pissarides plan propose? It suggested that small and medium-sized enterprises that cannot compete should be shut down. Conversely, we believe that small and medium-sized enterprises are the foundation of the economy and should be supported. What did, and what does, New Democracy's plan for small and medium-sized businesses propose? Those who can compete survive, while the others perish.
