Our aim, as I have told you, is nothing less than reversing the correlation and achieving a victorious result. In any case, it is necessary for society, the country, and democracy to not leave the prospect of an uncontrolled right-wing regime in the next day. There must be a strong force that can look those who want to impose anti-social policies in the eye. Given the fact that we are voting with enhanced proportional representation this time and the familiar dilemmas are being posed again, it is not us who are posing them, it is life. Every vote of a progressive citizen poses these dilemmas. A vote that is directed anywhere else but to the Syriza ballot box, from a progressive citizen who understands that the new democracy must not be strengthened and unchecked, objectively favors the design of New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis.
