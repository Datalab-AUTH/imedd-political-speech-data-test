And here comes the new democracy in four years, outside of the memoranda, with the European Union allowing them to spend over 50 billion. With the pandemic as the reason and cause, but where to spend it as a priority? On health. So what do they do? They leave the hospitals in ruins. They are cutting staff, six and a half thousand fewer doctors and nurses, fewer permanent staff in 2023 than we left in '19, and they are leaving the ambulance service without staff, without rescuers. 560 left this four-year period, not a single hiring by Mr. Mitsotakis. Why? Didn't he now have the budgetary capacity? Did he have the troika counting his last euro? No, and we had it and we hired. Now without the troika, they let the ambulance service collapse. 148 ambulances we took over in 2018. We have ambulances today. We have no rescuers, and in most tourist areas, there is only one ambulance. In the Attica basin, 84 ambulances were operating in our days. 52 are operating today. Why? Because I am not in their plan to support public health. Because human life is not in their values. Human life is cheap. A woman can die in the back of a pickup truck like a dog, but it costs... it costs health care, and it can't be taken over by the public.
