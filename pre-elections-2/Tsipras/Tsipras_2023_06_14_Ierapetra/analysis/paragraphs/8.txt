The pandemic came, and we didn't have time to shudder at its plan. We shuddered at the numbers and the results of the country being the worst in Europe in terms of deaths, in proportion to our population. We mourned 38,000 victims, worse than Bolsonaro's Brazil. Why? Because the National Health System was weak, unprotected, and powerless. Because we were told then, remember: "We don't have studies that prove that outside of intensive care units, people can die. It's the same either inside or outside of intensive care units."
