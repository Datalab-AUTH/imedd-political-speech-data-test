Because the result of the May 21 elections was not only negative for us, but also negative for society and the country. That is the main thing that motivates us to do more. That is why we have been giving a coordinated response from the first days. We will all be here, present and accounted for, in this new battle - more stubborn, more determined, and more united than ever before. And we will fight until the last second before the ballot box closes for a victorious result. We will fight with heart, with soul, but also with brains, putting our program at the center, talking to the people about the big issues that matter to them - programs, not propaganda; society, not communication.
