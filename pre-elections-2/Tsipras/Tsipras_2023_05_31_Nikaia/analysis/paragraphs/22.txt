We invest in truth, not propaganda. The truth showed its face from the very first moments of New Democracy's electoral victory on May 21. We saw the modesty of democracy yield to the unprecedented arrogance of power. Mr. Mitsotakis has wasted no time in recent days, presenting himself as the only candidate for prime minister and the only party running in these elections with the aim of claiming governance. He has already anticipated the result of the second ballot, even though he says the polls will be empty on June 25.
