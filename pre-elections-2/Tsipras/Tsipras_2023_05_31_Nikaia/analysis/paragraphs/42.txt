That is why we want to call on all of you and all citizens today to prevent this prospect. On June 25, we are not electing a manager of power. The Greek people are being asked to choose which plan the country will follow in the coming years, which will be its life in the coming years. Therefore, I call upon you to fight this battle together. The battle for people's lives, the battle for society. I call upon you to stand together side by side, to stand together stronger. And I am not only calling you, the members, the voters of SYRIZA. I call every democratic citizen. And I call on them to put aside our differences in the face of the possibility of an unchecked right-wing. I also address the citizens who have been disappointed by our mistakes and omissions. I appeal to the young people who chose abstention thinking they are all the same. I am addressing the progressive citizens who chose parties smaller than Syriza. And I have only one thing to say to them: It is worth joining forces and fighting this battle together. It is worth it because now we are voting for our lives and not for our party, and because together we can turn it around. Together we can avert the prospect of an out-of-control and arrogant right-wing government. Together we can prevent the imposition of a program that will cost the people and the country dearly. So let us all start together from here in the Red of Struggles, let us all start together on a new path with new confidence, with new trust. No vote lost until June 25. No vote without a goal. No vote that does not take into account what is to come, the future that is being prepared for us.
