Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular neighbourhoods of Piraeus, we are here today because we have heard the message of the Greek people. It is not the people's fault, it is our fault that we have failed to communicate our programme and express our messages in a way commensurate with our capabilities and our history. I take that responsibility first. We are here today precisely because we have heard this message and want to join with your strength to mend the threads that we cut on our own responsibility, in a new path of trust. On May 21st, the Greek people told us that they have greater demands of us, that they expect more, and I will be the first to say that they are right. We got the message and we are setting the bar high to correct ourselves. We are changing, getting stronger, and moving forward. Our fight is not to keep our seats and our percentages, but to keep the hope of justice alive in this society and country. That is our struggle, to keep the cohesion of society alive in the face of policies that want to crush and weaken it.
