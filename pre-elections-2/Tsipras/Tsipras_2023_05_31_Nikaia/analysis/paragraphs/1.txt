Thank you very much for this warm welcome. It truly strengthens my soul. I want to express my gratitude for your presence here today as we embark on a new beginning. We must remember that although we may fall, we must always get back up. We are all standing here together, and I wonder if there is anyone among us who truly believed that we would not fight this new battle with determination, or that there was even a chance that we would give up and abandon this fight. We did not give up during much more difficult times, and we will not give up now. So let us stand up and face this challenge together.
