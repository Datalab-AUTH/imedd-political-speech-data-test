Many times, our opponents believed that we would give up the battle. We fell many times along the way, but we got up and always fought. We didn't give them the slightest slack, and we won't give them slack now. It is no coincidence that we have decided to start this new critical battle together again, from here, from Kokkinia, from our roots, from our home. Kokkinia is the home of workers' struggles, the National Resistance, refugees, and the Kokkinia blockade. Here, we have our roots, the roots of justice, equality, and struggle. In this neighborhood, as well as in other popular neighborhoods of Piraeus, such as Keratsini, Drapetsona, Perama, and Korydallos, the voice of young people against fascism has been resounding for ten years with the slogan "Pavlo, you live!" Here, in these streets, is our home and our political heritage. We are a resilient people who do not compromise, who do not give in to any correlation, who do not give up.
