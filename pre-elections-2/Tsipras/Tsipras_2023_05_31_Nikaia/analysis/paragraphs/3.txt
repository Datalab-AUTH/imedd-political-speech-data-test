This is the message that I want to convey today to the centers of power, who once again dream and plan to finish us off. To all those who cannot hide their impatience, today we answer them from here, from Kokkinia: the controlled and convenient two-party system, which bankrupted us and threw us on the rocks, will not return. We are not going to do you any favors, we are not going to give up. Red will be red again! The people's neighborhoods, the workers, the employees, the unemployed, the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs will not be left without support, without a decoy, without someone to genuinely represent their class interests, and we will do everything in our power to achieve this.
