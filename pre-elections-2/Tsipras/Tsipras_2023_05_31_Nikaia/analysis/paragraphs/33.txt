We remember that despite the difficulty of the memoranda and the pressure of the Troika at that time, we covered 2.5 million uninsured people. We put them in the National Health System and gave them healthcare. Now, without memoranda or the Troika, those who cannot pay their contributions are left out of healthcare. Do we deserve such a present and an even worse future? Or should we go to the GAO to decide how much a human life costs? How much does it cost an indebted dealer who cannot access medicines? What is the cost of a human life?
