But we do not have a war to justify such losses. We have something else: a war on labor. That is what we have had for the last four years. They have annihilated protection measures, effectively dismantled the Labor Inspectorate, and neutralized control mechanisms. So it is a specific policy. You were wrong to rush to say that it is a matter of luck, bad luck... No. It is a matter of policy, a specific policy that does not respect safety at work or people's lives. That puts profits before people's lives, that's what it is. There is a certain politics behind the tragedies, and we must not forget that. We have no right to forget that. You know it because you are living it. The New Democracy government has deliberately chosen to invest in the complete deregulation of labor relations. They turn overtime into unpaid work, liberalize redundancies, make workers feel lucky to have a job, and not care about their working conditions. These are Mr. Mitsotakis's so-called 'well-paid jobs'. Unfortunately, this is the truth of his policy.
