But this policy is not a one-way street, as they want to make it appear. The SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance has been identified from its beginnings with the interests of the world of work. The SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance exists primarily to represent the world of work. That is why the cry of the wife of the worker from Perama, who unjustly lost his life, the cry that she was saying, resounds strongly in our ears and disturbs us: "Let there be no more horror wages, let this incident not be forgotten, let no other family be hurt." That is what we will fight for, that is what we will fight for with all our strength. Our programme, friends, and our actions are diametrically opposed to the programme and the actions of the New Democracy. We have proved this in the most difficult times, in the most difficult circumstances, with the increase in the minimum wage, the abolition of the minimum wage, the imposition of fines on banks that violated working hours, the revival of the Labour Inspectorate, which they then abolished, with the promotion of legislation for invisible and precarious workers, as in the case of courier workers.
