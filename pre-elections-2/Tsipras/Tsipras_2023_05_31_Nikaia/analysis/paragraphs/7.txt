We are not flying in the clouds. We are fully aware of the difficulties, but we also have a non-negotiable principle, born out of the most difficult years, where our roots, as I said before, are still alive. Our history, the history of the struggles of our people, has taught us one thing: Only battles that are not fought are lost. We will not only fight this battle, but we will bleed if necessary to win it. Because our success in the electoral battle before us, I repeat, is not about us; it is about the vast majority of our people.
