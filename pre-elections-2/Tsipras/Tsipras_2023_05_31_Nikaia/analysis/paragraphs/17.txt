Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular areas of Piraeus, a few days ago, Mr. Mitsotakis visited Perama. He found, he said, smiling faces of workers. And the day before yesterday - well, the irony, but it is tragic irony! - in an interview with a television station, he boasted about the results he achieved last Sunday in Perama. Why? Because he put the Shipbuilding Zone in order, he said, and provided jobs. But reality came to remind him only a few hours later of the harsh face of their policies. One worker was killed the next day in the Shipbuilding Zone, and two were injured. 57 workers were killed in workplace accidents in the first quarter of 2023. Dozens of working people leave for work and never return.
