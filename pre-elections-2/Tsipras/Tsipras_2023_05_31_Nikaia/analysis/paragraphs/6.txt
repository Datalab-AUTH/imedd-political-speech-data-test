Friends, on June 25th we do not have a run-off election. It is not a run-off match, to speak in football terms, where there was a defeat in the first match and the score counts. It is a second, completely separate election. And this election is also the most crucial election because it is the contest that will give the country the government it will have for the next few years. This final and crucial election will decide the lives of people, our fellow citizens, and all of us for the next four years. It will decide whether we will move towards a society of freedom, rights, justice, and security or a society where inequality, the party-prey state, corruption, and the waste of public money will become the norm and an uncontrollable regime. This electoral battle will decide whether public goods, even water, will become the object of trade and obscenity, whether hundreds of thousands of houses will be put under the hammer, and whether even human lives will be sacrificed on the altar of speculative absurdity.
