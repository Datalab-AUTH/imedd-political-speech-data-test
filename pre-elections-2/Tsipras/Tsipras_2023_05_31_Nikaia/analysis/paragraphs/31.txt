Talk to the world about public health. Is it an exaggeration that thousands of people died helplessly during the pandemic? Is it an exaggeration that the National Health Service was allowed to collapse at a time when its immense importance was demonstrated? Would-be healthcare investors are already taking up residence on the doorsteps of hospitals. Have we not wised up in spite of all we had in the pandemic? The numbers say it all. In December 2019, those who served the National Health System - doctors, nurses, and staff - numbered 108,000 employees. In December 2022, it is 84,000, despite the fact that we went through the pandemic and didn't think twice. Are we going to let this continue?
