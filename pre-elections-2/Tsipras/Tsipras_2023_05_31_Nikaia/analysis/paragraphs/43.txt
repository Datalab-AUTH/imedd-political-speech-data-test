SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is, was, and will remain the great popular force of resistance, hope, and justice. It has been and will remain the great force by the side of the people. There are no impossibilities for societies and peoples seeking a better tomorrow. Together, we can. With the strength of our program and the subversive momentum of our ideas, the ideas of democracy and justice, we will succeed! We will fight this battle and we will stand up. Good strength, strong, determined, optimistic! Goodbye.
