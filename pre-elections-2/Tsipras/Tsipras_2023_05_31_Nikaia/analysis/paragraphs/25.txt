But I want to tell you, friends, from Kokkinia, that the news is not good. Nothing is over until the battle is over. Nothing is decided until the polls open. Democracy does not thrive on fear and threats. However, some people are saying, "Since it is now so difficult to overturn the result that came out on May 21 and have the reverse on June 25, why should we vote for Syriza? Let's vote for smaller parties."
