Is there a greater fear than the certainty that the human right to health, to life, will be traded? Since June 1st, we learned two days ago, hundreds of thousands of professionals have been left without healthcare. In crisis conditions, they have not been able to meet their health insurance contributions. The fact is: you pay or else you are left to die. Those who, two days before the elections, used their propaganda machine to spread the miserable lie everywhere that we have a plan to increase social security contributions. The same people who were spreading this miserable lie that Syriza would increase contributions are now leaving tens of thousands of freelancers and farmers without healthcare, ten days later.
