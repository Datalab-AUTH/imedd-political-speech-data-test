Talk to people about public infrastructure. They advertised the railway and we ended up with the tragedy of the Tempi River. They advertise the executive state and we end up with tragedies. They advertised the digital state and we ended up with the hilarious tragedy of the school exams yesterday and the day before yesterday. If this had happened on our watch, we would have been hanged... The excellent ones!
