It is obvious, not only from what they say and don't say, but from what their actions have revealed over the past four years: They want to constitutionalize speculation everywhere, in higher education, hospitals, public infrastructure, water, and energy. That's what they want to do, that's what they seek to do. The public good, represented by the PPC which they privatised, is their great enemy. That is what they want to abolish constitutionally.
