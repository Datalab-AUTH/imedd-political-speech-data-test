To talk to people about the upcoming auctions of first homes and the 700,000 families who are at risk of losing their homes, Mr. Mitsotakis made it clear in an interview on the Friday before the elections. He stated that he wants to crush those who hid behind the Katseli law and saved their properties - that is the word he used! He referred to them as 'strategic defaulters', including the chief strategic defaulter with the 400 million debt of New Democracy. Although they tried to hold back until the elections, we saw the tragic signs of this policy in many families. There is a tsunami of foreclosures coming after the election. This is the greatest redistribution of property and wealth the country has ever known, and it is not scaremongering. It is data, it is numbers. 700,000 properties worth EUR 40 billion are in funds. Are we going to let this happen? This is what we need to talk to the world about! Are we going to let it happen, or are we going to go to the polls to support the program that protects first homes, commercial housing, and agricultural land from the funds?
