I want to call on all of you to go out into the world over the next 25 days and speak to the people with courage. Speak to them in the language of truth, our truth. Talk about today and tomorrow. Talk about the supermarket, the petrol station, the electricity bill, and the daily adventure of inexactitude that will become a permanent normality, since Mr Mitsotakis likes the word 'adventure'. Let us talk about the New Democracy proposal. What is its proposal for dealing with inexactitude? And what is it in practice? Sky-high profits for the big groups. That is their proposal. Six billion euros of excess profits in 2022 to energy providers and refineries, unregulated speculation and profiteering, and some passport to charity for the many. But where will that end?
