This is exactly what New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis want: to be all-powerful and do whatever they want for the next four years, undisturbed. This is exactly what he desires. They want to turn the opposition of the majority of the electorate anywhere else - opposition to New Democracy, I mean - other than Syriza. Because if it goes to SYRIZA, they will lose the election despite the large margin they have. And in any case, what they want is not to have a strong opponent. That's what they want. New Democracy and its propaganda apparatus want many small and weak parties against them, not a strong opponent that can look them in the eye, that can either reverse the correlations or prevent them from their plan of social plunder. That is what they want. So we call on all democratic citizens to think once and twice. We call on all democratic citizens who did not choose the New Democracy party in the last ballot and who will not choose it now.
