A large reduction of up to 40% in the purchasing power of wages and pensions is occurring, while SYRIZA declares that the excess profits of 7-8 large business groups should be taxed in an extraordinary way to return the money to Greek society. This has been done throughout Europe, and Mr. Mitsotakis was forced to commit to taxing them at 90% in Parliament. However, we are not talking about taxing the small middle class or the majority of the middle class. Instead, we are talking about reducing the Value Added Tax, the indirect tax that has plundered Greek society. We are not talking about taxes, but about putting an end to obscenity.
