Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular neighborhoods of Piraeus, we have decided to make this restart together. It is no coincidence that we decided to start from here. I invite you to communicate this to the citizens in the next 25 days. Speak the truth about the great difficulties we face and the crucial programmatic differences. There will be many ballot papers on the ballot box, but there are two opposing plans. One is the alternative proposal for power and governance to that of the Right and Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy.
