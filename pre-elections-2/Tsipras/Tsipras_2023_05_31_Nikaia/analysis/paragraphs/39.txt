Finally, we should also discuss the great opportunity that lies ahead for the country in the next few years, despite the technical terms involved. This opportunity is the European resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. Over the next few years, our country will receive significant European resources, totaling over EUR 70 billion, in addition to the NSRF. And what is New Democracy doing? It is squandering this opportunity for the country in the way it knows best - giving the money to the few and powerful, subsidizing chronic pathologies, and turning a tool for development into a mechanism for micro-political management. This choice undermines the future of the country. The question is: Will the Greek people entrust these 70 billion and their use to those who have shown over the past four years that their plan was direct outsourcing and cheap development, without added value, without a productive edge, without decent wages? Or will they support a program of redirecting resources at the ballot box, with the aim of investing them productively for the good of the economy and society, with a view to regional recovery and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and strengthening public infrastructure? But with honesty in their management, honesty and fairness in their distribution and use? This is the crucial question.
