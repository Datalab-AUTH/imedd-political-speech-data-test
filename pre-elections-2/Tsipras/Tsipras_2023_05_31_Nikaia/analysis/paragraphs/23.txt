While, on the other hand, Mr. Adonis Georgiades states, "Don't get upset, these are our political opponents, and we must see and hear their arguments and respond to their arguments." What did he arrogantly declare just two days after the elections? He said that New Democracy is not seeking to win, not self-reliance; it is seeking the omnipotence of 180 seats. Why? To change the Constitution on its own. Constitutional revision by only one party is an aberration that has never happened in the country since the post-independence period.
