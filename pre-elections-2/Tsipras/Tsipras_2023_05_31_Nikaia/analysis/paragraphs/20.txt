Because our concept of development does not require human sacrifice. In our vocabulary, the word "development" is synonymous with rules, rights, justice, and the basic principle that wealth should be shared and enjoyed by all its producers. Otherwise, we will live in a society where numbers sometimes prosper but people always suffer. In the coming elections, therefore, not only parties and people are being judged, but our lives. The lives of workers, young people, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the social majority. One of our political opponents is New Democracy, who invests in fear - fear of instability, adventure, and uncharted waters. But there is no greater instability than the stability of job insecurity, which they have imposed for four years and want to perpetuate in the years to come.
