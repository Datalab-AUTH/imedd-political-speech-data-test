To talk to people about the real problems and the language of truth. To talk to them about public education and our schools that have no teachers. Because, as the well-known Mr. Psarianos, candidate for parliament and perennial New Democracy second-in-command, told us yesterday, "teachers are scum, Mafia bosses, worms, and bums." But the point is not what he said; he understands as much as he says. The point is that the spokesman for New Democracy, Mr. Skertsos, came out today and absolutely covered for him. He said, "there is no issue with everything he says, he will remain on the New Democracy ballot papers." That's why they haven't hired teachers for so many years in public schools because they consider them "scumbags and mafia bosses." And tens of thousands of children are denied access to higher education through the Minimum Admission Base. Why? Because their goal is to serve private interests, colleges, and private schools. That is their plan.
