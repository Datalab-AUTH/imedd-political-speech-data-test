We urge all those who understand how unfavorable it will be for the country, for society, and for democracy in the final and crucial ballot that will decide our lives for the next four years to achieve a similar result to that of May 21. Despite any reservations or disagreements they may have with us, we call on them to join their voices and forces with us because together, we can bring about a reversal. Together, we can put a stop to arrogance and fear. We know how to do it, and we have done it before in difficult circumstances. Democratic citizens also know that no mistake or failure can override our commitment to their interests, which we have demonstrated in difficult years.
