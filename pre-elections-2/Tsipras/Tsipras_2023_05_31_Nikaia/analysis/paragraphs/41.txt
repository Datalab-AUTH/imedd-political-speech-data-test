That is why today you have not heard me say and will not say a word about the other forces of the progressive space. They missed a great opportunity, and we missed a great opportunity. The country missed a great opportunity when we extended the hand of cooperation, and they were looking at how to cut off our hand, to shorten it. When we were looking at the country and its future, they were looking at how to grow their own fields. We have responsibilities, but they also have great responsibilities, and they don't seem to care where the country is headed. If this correlation is not reversed, the country will head towards an out-of-control Right.
