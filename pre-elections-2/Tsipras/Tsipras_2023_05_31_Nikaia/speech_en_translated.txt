Thank you very much for this warm welcome. It truly strengthens my soul. I want to express my gratitude for your presence here today as we embark on a new beginning. We must remember that although we may fall, we must always get back up. We are all standing here together, and I wonder if there is anyone among us who truly believed that we would not fight this new battle with determination, or that there was even a chance that we would give up and abandon this fight. We did not give up during much more difficult times, and we will not give up now. So let us stand up and face this challenge together.

Many times, our opponents believed that we would give up the battle. We fell many times along the way, but we got up and always fought. We didn't give them the slightest slack, and we won't give them slack now. It is no coincidence that we have decided to start this new critical battle together again, from here, from Kokkinia, from our roots, from our home. Kokkinia is the home of workers' struggles, the National Resistance, refugees, and the Kokkinia blockade. Here, we have our roots, the roots of justice, equality, and struggle. In this neighborhood, as well as in other popular neighborhoods of Piraeus, such as Keratsini, Drapetsona, Perama, and Korydallos, the voice of young people against fascism has been resounding for ten years with the slogan "Pavlo, you live!" Here, in these streets, is our home and our political heritage. We are a resilient people who do not compromise, who do not give in to any correlation, who do not give up.

This is the message that I want to convey today to the centers of power, who once again dream and plan to finish us off. To all those who cannot hide their impatience, today we answer them from here, from Kokkinia: the controlled and convenient two-party system, which bankrupted us and threw us on the rocks, will not return. We are not going to do you any favors, we are not going to give up. Red will be red again! The people's neighborhoods, the workers, the employees, the unemployed, the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs will not be left without support, without a decoy, without someone to genuinely represent their class interests, and we will do everything in our power to achieve this.

Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular neighbourhoods of Piraeus, we are here today because we have heard the message of the Greek people. It is not the people's fault, it is our fault that we have failed to communicate our programme and express our messages in a way commensurate with our capabilities and our history. I take that responsibility first. We are here today precisely because we have heard this message and want to join with your strength to mend the threads that we cut on our own responsibility, in a new path of trust. On May 21st, the Greek people told us that they have greater demands of us, that they expect more, and I will be the first to say that they are right. We got the message and we are setting the bar high to correct ourselves. We are changing, getting stronger, and moving forward. Our fight is not to keep our seats and our percentages, but to keep the hope of justice alive in this society and country. That is our struggle, to keep the cohesion of society alive in the face of policies that want to crush and weaken it.

Because the result of the May 21 elections was not only negative for us, but also negative for society and the country. That is the main thing that motivates us to do more. That is why we have been giving a coordinated response from the first days. We will all be here, present and accounted for, in this new battle - more stubborn, more determined, and more united than ever before. And we will fight until the last second before the ballot box closes for a victorious result. We will fight with heart, with soul, but also with brains, putting our program at the center, talking to the people about the big issues that matter to them - programs, not propaganda; society, not communication.

Friends, on June 25th we do not have a run-off election. It is not a run-off match, to speak in football terms, where there was a defeat in the first match and the score counts. It is a second, completely separate election. And this election is also the most crucial election because it is the contest that will give the country the government it will have for the next few years. This final and crucial election will decide the lives of people, our fellow citizens, and all of us for the next four years. It will decide whether we will move towards a society of freedom, rights, justice, and security or a society where inequality, the party-prey state, corruption, and the waste of public money will become the norm and an uncontrollable regime. This electoral battle will decide whether public goods, even water, will become the object of trade and obscenity, whether hundreds of thousands of houses will be put under the hammer, and whether even human lives will be sacrificed on the altar of speculative absurdity.

We are not flying in the clouds. We are fully aware of the difficulties, but we also have a non-negotiable principle, born out of the most difficult years, where our roots, as I said before, are still alive. Our history, the history of the struggles of our people, has taught us one thing: Only battles that are not fought are lost. We will not only fight this battle, but we will bleed if necessary to win it. Because our success in the electoral battle before us, I repeat, is not about us; it is about the vast majority of our people.

It concerns employees in the private and public sectors whose pay does not correspond to their performance and working conditions.

It concerns pensioners who live in marginal housing.

It concerns individuals who have experienced a 40% decrease in their purchasing power in recent years.

It concerns the unemployed and young people.

It concerns those living below the poverty line, which is 30%.

It concerns freelancers who are testing their strengths by the thousands without a tomorrow.

It concerns the rural world and rural people in general, who produce at a cost for the middlemen and food cartels.

It concerns healthy entrepreneurs operating in a high-cost and unfair competition.

This battle is for all of them, not for our party. This large majority has nothing to gain with New Democracy in government. On the contrary, it has much to lose. This majority has much to gain from the alternative power proposal of SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, from the implementation of the SYRIZA programme, and we must communicate our programme to this majority.

Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular areas of Piraeus, a few days ago, Mr. Mitsotakis visited Perama. He found, he said, smiling faces of workers. And the day before yesterday - well, the irony, but it is tragic irony! - in an interview with a television station, he boasted about the results he achieved last Sunday in Perama. Why? Because he put the Shipbuilding Zone in order, he said, and provided jobs. But reality came to remind him only a few hours later of the harsh face of their policies. One worker was killed the next day in the Shipbuilding Zone, and two were injured. 57 workers were killed in workplace accidents in the first quarter of 2023. Dozens of working people leave for work and never return.

But we do not have a war to justify such losses. We have something else: a war on labor. That is what we have had for the last four years. They have annihilated protection measures, effectively dismantled the Labor Inspectorate, and neutralized control mechanisms. So it is a specific policy. You were wrong to rush to say that it is a matter of luck, bad luck... No. It is a matter of policy, a specific policy that does not respect safety at work or people's lives. That puts profits before people's lives, that's what it is. There is a certain politics behind the tragedies, and we must not forget that. We have no right to forget that. You know it because you are living it. The New Democracy government has deliberately chosen to invest in the complete deregulation of labor relations. They turn overtime into unpaid work, liberalize redundancies, make workers feel lucky to have a job, and not care about their working conditions. These are Mr. Mitsotakis's so-called 'well-paid jobs'. Unfortunately, this is the truth of his policy.

But this policy is not a one-way street, as they want to make it appear. The SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance has been identified from its beginnings with the interests of the world of work. The SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance exists primarily to represent the world of work. That is why the cry of the wife of the worker from Perama, who unjustly lost his life, the cry that she was saying, resounds strongly in our ears and disturbs us: "Let there be no more horror wages, let this incident not be forgotten, let no other family be hurt." That is what we will fight for, that is what we will fight for with all our strength. Our programme, friends, and our actions are diametrically opposed to the programme and the actions of the New Democracy. We have proved this in the most difficult times, in the most difficult circumstances, with the increase in the minimum wage, the abolition of the minimum wage, the imposition of fines on banks that violated working hours, the revival of the Labour Inspectorate, which they then abolished, with the promotion of legislation for invisible and precarious workers, as in the case of courier workers.

Because our concept of development does not require human sacrifice. In our vocabulary, the word "development" is synonymous with rules, rights, justice, and the basic principle that wealth should be shared and enjoyed by all its producers. Otherwise, we will live in a society where numbers sometimes prosper but people always suffer. In the coming elections, therefore, not only parties and people are being judged, but our lives. The lives of workers, young people, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the social majority. One of our political opponents is New Democracy, who invests in fear - fear of instability, adventure, and uncharted waters. But there is no greater instability than the stability of job insecurity, which they have imposed for four years and want to perpetuate in the years to come.

We, on the other hand, invest in our program, our proposals, our positions, the stability of social justice, labor normality, democracy, and social cohesion. There can be no stability without justice and cohesion in society. We are investing in our program and in something that is not self-evident in today's circumstances: our honesty and clean hands.

We invest in truth, not propaganda. The truth showed its face from the very first moments of New Democracy's electoral victory on May 21. We saw the modesty of democracy yield to the unprecedented arrogance of power. Mr. Mitsotakis has wasted no time in recent days, presenting himself as the only candidate for prime minister and the only party running in these elections with the aim of claiming governance. He has already anticipated the result of the second ballot, even though he says the polls will be empty on June 25.

While, on the other hand, Mr. Adonis Georgiades states, "Don't get upset, these are our political opponents, and we must see and hear their arguments and respond to their arguments." What did he arrogantly declare just two days after the elections? He said that New Democracy is not seeking to win, not self-reliance; it is seeking the omnipotence of 180 seats. Why? To change the Constitution on its own. Constitutional revision by only one party is an aberration that has never happened in the country since the post-independence period.

But why do they say that? What exactly do they want to do? What's in the back of their minds? It is obvious, not only from what they say and don't say, but from what their actions have revealed over the past four years: They want to constitutionalize speculation everywhere, in higher education, hospitals, public infrastructure, water, and energy. That's what they want to do, that's what they seek to do. The public good, represented by the PPC which they privatised, is their great enemy. That is what they want to abolish constitutionally.

But I want to tell you, friends, from Kokkinia, that the news is not good. Nothing is over until the battle is over. Nothing is decided until the polls open. Democracy does not thrive on fear and threats. However, some people are saying, "Since it is now so difficult to overturn the result that came out on May 21 and have the reverse on June 25, why should we vote for Syriza? Let's vote for smaller parties."

This is exactly what New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis want: to be all-powerful and do whatever they want for the next four years, undisturbed. This is exactly what he desires. They want to turn the opposition of the majority of the electorate anywhere else - opposition to New Democracy, I mean - other than Syriza. Because if it goes to SYRIZA, they will lose the election despite the large margin they have. And in any case, what they want is not to have a strong opponent. That's what they want. New Democracy and its propaganda apparatus want many small and weak parties against them, not a strong opponent that can look them in the eye, that can either reverse the correlations or prevent them from their plan of social plunder. That is what they want. So we call on all democratic citizens to think once and twice. We call on all democratic citizens who did not choose the New Democracy party in the last ballot and who will not choose it now.

We urge all those who understand how unfavorable it will be for the country, for society, and for democracy in the final and crucial ballot that will decide our lives for the next four years to achieve a similar result to that of May 21. Despite any reservations or disagreements they may have with us, we call on them to join their voices and forces with us because together, we can bring about a reversal. Together, we can put a stop to arrogance and fear. We know how to do it, and we have done it before in difficult circumstances. Democratic citizens also know that no mistake or failure can override our commitment to their interests, which we have demonstrated in difficult years.

I want to call on all of you to go out into the world over the next 25 days and speak to the people with courage. Speak to them in the language of truth, our truth. Talk about today and tomorrow. Talk about the supermarket, the petrol station, the electricity bill, and the daily adventure of inexactitude that will become a permanent normality, since Mr Mitsotakis likes the word 'adventure'. Let us talk about the New Democracy proposal. What is its proposal for dealing with inexactitude? And what is it in practice? Sky-high profits for the big groups. That is their proposal. Six billion euros of excess profits in 2022 to energy providers and refineries, unregulated speculation and profiteering, and some passport to charity for the many. But where will that end?

A large reduction of up to 40% in the purchasing power of wages and pensions is occurring, while SYRIZA declares that the excess profits of 7-8 large business groups should be taxed in an extraordinary way to return the money to Greek society. This has been done throughout Europe, and Mr. Mitsotakis was forced to commit to taxing them at 90% in Parliament. However, we are not talking about taxing the small middle class or the majority of the middle class. Instead, we are talking about reducing the Value Added Tax, the indirect tax that has plundered Greek society. We are not talking about taxes, but about putting an end to obscenity.

Does anyone believe that this normalization of obscenity has a chance of changing if New Democracy prevails in the elections? Is there anyone who can believe that the law of the strongest will not prevail with the election of New Democracy? And that is not a possibility, that is not a fear. It is a certainty, we all know it. Just as it is certain that there is an answer. The answer that our program gives is about controls on the markets, the reduction of VAT, and the reduction of excise duty. There is breathing space for households.

Talk to the world about public health. Is it an exaggeration that thousands of people died helplessly during the pandemic? Is it an exaggeration that the National Health Service was allowed to collapse at a time when its immense importance was demonstrated? Would-be healthcare investors are already taking up residence on the doorsteps of hospitals. Have we not wised up in spite of all we had in the pandemic? The numbers say it all. In December 2019, those who served the National Health System - doctors, nurses, and staff - numbered 108,000 employees. In December 2022, it is 84,000, despite the fact that we went through the pandemic and didn't think twice. Are we going to let this continue?

Is there a greater fear than the certainty that the human right to health, to life, will be traded? Since June 1st, we learned two days ago, hundreds of thousands of professionals have been left without healthcare. In crisis conditions, they have not been able to meet their health insurance contributions. The fact is: you pay or else you are left to die. Those who, two days before the elections, used their propaganda machine to spread the miserable lie everywhere that we have a plan to increase social security contributions. The same people who were spreading this miserable lie that Syriza would increase contributions are now leaving tens of thousands of freelancers and farmers without healthcare, ten days later.

We remember that despite the difficulty of the memoranda and the pressure of the Troika at that time, we covered 2.5 million uninsured people. We put them in the National Health System and gave them healthcare. Now, without memoranda or the Troika, those who cannot pay their contributions are left out of healthcare. Do we deserve such a present and an even worse future? Or should we go to the GAO to decide how much a human life costs? How much does it cost an indebted dealer who cannot access medicines? What is the cost of a human life?

We will not go to the General Accounting Office to decide how much a human life costs. We will go to the ballot box. We will go to the ballot box en masse to support the debt adjustment program with a haircut and 120 installments. We will support the program for a new NHS, upgraded, with people who are better paid and work in security.

To talk to people about the real problems and the language of truth. To talk to them about public education and our schools that have no teachers. Because, as the well-known Mr. Psarianos, candidate for parliament and perennial New Democracy second-in-command, told us yesterday, "teachers are scum, Mafia bosses, worms, and bums." But the point is not what he said; he understands as much as he says. The point is that the spokesman for New Democracy, Mr. Skertsos, came out today and absolutely covered for him. He said, "there is no issue with everything he says, he will remain on the New Democracy ballot papers." That's why they haven't hired teachers for so many years in public schools because they consider them "scumbags and mafia bosses." And tens of thousands of children are denied access to higher education through the Minimum Admission Base. Why? Because their goal is to serve private interests, colleges, and private schools. That is their plan.

Are we going to let it happen and continue to expand over the next four years? Will we allow the creation of ghettos in education for those who cannot afford it, or will we go to the ballot box to support a program that recruits and phases out substitutes in secondary education? A program that recruits teachers instead of police officers for universities? A barrier-free public education program for all children, regardless of their family's financial situation?

Talk to people about public infrastructure. They advertised the railway and we ended up with the tragedy of the Tempi River. They advertise the executive state and we end up with tragedies. They advertised the digital state and we ended up with the hilarious tragedy of the school exams yesterday and the day before yesterday. If this had happened on our watch, we would have been hanged... The excellent ones!

To talk to people about the upcoming auctions of first homes and the 700,000 families who are at risk of losing their homes, Mr. Mitsotakis made it clear in an interview on the Friday before the elections. He stated that he wants to crush those who hid behind the Katseli law and saved their properties - that is the word he used! He referred to them as 'strategic defaulters', including the chief strategic defaulter with the 400 million debt of New Democracy. Although they tried to hold back until the elections, we saw the tragic signs of this policy in many families. There is a tsunami of foreclosures coming after the election. This is the greatest redistribution of property and wealth the country has ever known, and it is not scaremongering. It is data, it is numbers. 700,000 properties worth EUR 40 billion are in funds. Are we going to let this happen? This is what we need to talk to the world about! Are we going to let it happen, or are we going to go to the polls to support the program that protects first homes, commercial housing, and agricultural land from the funds?

Finally, we should also discuss the great opportunity that lies ahead for the country in the next few years, despite the technical terms involved. This opportunity is the European resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. Over the next few years, our country will receive significant European resources, totaling over EUR 70 billion, in addition to the NSRF. And what is New Democracy doing? It is squandering this opportunity for the country in the way it knows best - giving the money to the few and powerful, subsidizing chronic pathologies, and turning a tool for development into a mechanism for micro-political management. This choice undermines the future of the country. The question is: Will the Greek people entrust these 70 billion and their use to those who have shown over the past four years that their plan was direct outsourcing and cheap development, without added value, without a productive edge, without decent wages? Or will they support a program of redirecting resources at the ballot box, with the aim of investing them productively for the good of the economy and society, with a view to regional recovery and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and strengthening public infrastructure? But with honesty in their management, honesty and fairness in their distribution and use? This is the crucial question.

Citizens of Kokkinia and the popular neighborhoods of Piraeus, we have decided to make this restart together. It is no coincidence that we decided to start from here. I invite you to communicate this to the citizens in the next 25 days. Speak the truth about the great difficulties we face and the crucial programmatic differences. There will be many ballot papers on the ballot box, but there are two opposing plans. One is the alternative proposal for power and governance to that of the Right and Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy.

That is why today you have not heard me say and will not say a word about the other forces of the progressive space. They missed a great opportunity, and we missed a great opportunity. The country missed a great opportunity when we extended the hand of cooperation, and they were looking at how to cut off our hand, to shorten it. When we were looking at the country and its future, they were looking at how to grow their own fields. We have responsibilities, but they also have great responsibilities, and they don't seem to care where the country is headed. If this correlation is not reversed, the country will head towards an out-of-control Right.

That is why we want to call on all of you and all citizens today to prevent this prospect. On June 25, we are not electing a manager of power. The Greek people are being asked to choose which plan the country will follow in the coming years, which will be its life in the coming years. Therefore, I call upon you to fight this battle together. The battle for people's lives, the battle for society. I call upon you to stand together side by side, to stand together stronger. And I am not only calling you, the members, the voters of SYRIZA. I call every democratic citizen. And I call on them to put aside our differences in the face of the possibility of an unchecked right-wing. I also address the citizens who have been disappointed by our mistakes and omissions. I appeal to the young people who chose abstention thinking they are all the same. I am addressing the progressive citizens who chose parties smaller than Syriza. And I have only one thing to say to them: It is worth joining forces and fighting this battle together. It is worth it because now we are voting for our lives and not for our party, and because together we can turn it around. Together we can avert the prospect of an out-of-control and arrogant right-wing government. Together we can prevent the imposition of a program that will cost the people and the country dearly. So let us all start together from here in the Red of Struggles, let us all start together on a new path with new confidence, with new trust. No vote lost until June 25. No vote without a goal. No vote that does not take into account what is to come, the future that is being prepared for us.

SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is, was, and will remain the great popular force of resistance, hope, and justice. It has been and will remain the great force by the side of the people. There are no impossibilities for societies and peoples seeking a better tomorrow. Together, we can. With the strength of our program and the subversive momentum of our ideas, the ideas of democracy and justice, we will succeed! We will fight this battle and we will stand up. Good strength, strong, determined, optimistic! Goodbye.
