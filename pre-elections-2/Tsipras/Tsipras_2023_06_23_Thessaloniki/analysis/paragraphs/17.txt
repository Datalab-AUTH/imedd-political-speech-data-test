We stand with humanity, not with barbarism. And that, if you will, is our fundamental difference. As the great slogan of our youth says: "They talk about costs and damages, we talk about human lives." That is our fundamental difference. And you know, we do not consider color, religion, nationality, age, gender, or economic status when it comes to defending human life. That is what we have always done.
