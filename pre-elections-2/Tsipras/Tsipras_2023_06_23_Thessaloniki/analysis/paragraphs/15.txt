It foresees a reduction in the purchasing power of wage earners. Even worse, a more degraded NHS. And while Mr Mitsotakis promises that after the NSI, he will take the NSI under his protection and upgrade it as he upgraded the NSI, and while he promises that he will personally take over the NSI, here comes the MP and candidate of the New Democracy, Mr Pneimatikos, to put things in their place. And what did he announce? He missed the truth. Reduction of public spending on the NHS, hospital mergers, closure of structures, privatisation of nursing units and screening of patients. That's the plan. The NHS will have neither the spending nor the staff to meet the needs of its citizens. And expensive treatments will be administered based on patients' life expectancy. Anyone who doesn't have the life expectancy they will set, let them go to a private hospital. And if he can't afford it, good luck to him. This is the core of neoliberal ideology, have no doubt. It's no coincidence that the pandemic centenarians were not the first in all of Europe in deaths per million population, it's no coincidence that we are first in Europe in deaths per million population.
