We were looking at how the country would move forward. We were considering the interests of the country, while they were focused on how their own field would grow. Now, we find ourselves in a difficult situation, facing an uncontrolled and unchecked right-wing. They tell us, "We don't care if the right-wing is uncontrolled and unregulated, we want to win against Syriza." Well, you will never defeat SYRIZA. SYRIZA is a mature child of necessity, not a passing trend. Unlike PASOK, we will never become a governmental complement to our political opponents. We will never support right-wing policies or conservative governments. We will also never become a protest party. Our goal is to attain power and become a party of power, to give power to the Greek people and meet the needs of the social majority. That is what sets us apart. During the previous election period, we were slapped in the face because we were looking at the prospect of progressive government and turned the other cheek. That is over now. We will no longer leave anything unanswered. We will call a spade a spade to progressive and democratic citizens.
