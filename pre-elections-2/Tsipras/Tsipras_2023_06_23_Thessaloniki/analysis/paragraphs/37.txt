I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, your presence, and your struggle. This struggle is even more important than the triumphs we have achieved. At this moment, we are fighting the most beautiful battle. I want to make a commitment to you: we will go together until Sunday, until the last second, until the last ballot box is closed. Not a single vote will be wasted. But we will be together on Monday, continuing the fight to defend democracy and society. The struggle of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance represents the people who have no voice, the underprivileged Greeks. We will not leave anyone alone in this struggle.
