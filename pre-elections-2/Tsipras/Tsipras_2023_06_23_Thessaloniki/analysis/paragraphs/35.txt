We remember well that rant, the savage exploitation of patriotism, the bullying of citizens, members, and MPs of SYRIZA throughout Northern Greece, and especially here in Thessaloniki, on the occasion of an agreement that they fought against and for which they called us traitors. But once they were elected and became the government, they honored it - not just kept it - they kept it and honored it. And Zoran Zaev ended up sending a letter to Mr. Mitsotakis, thanking him for how much he fought to get North Macedonia into NATO and the European Union. And rightly so, I will say. But their hypocrisy and their patriotism know no bounds. Thessaloniki, Macedonia, has been the field of their divisive arrogance, their national frivolity, their subjugation even of patriotism to party and personal agendas.
