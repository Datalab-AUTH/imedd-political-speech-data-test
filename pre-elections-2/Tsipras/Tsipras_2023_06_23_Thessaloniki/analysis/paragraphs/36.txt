That was their stance. All for one, as long as SYRIZA is harmed. Partisanship over patriotic duty. So we do not play with our homeland. And this is the message I want to convey from here, from Thessaloniki. The second message I want to convey is that we do not play with democracy either, Mrs Bakoyannis and Mr Mitsotakis. If your aim with your threats towards minorities, these poor and defenseless people, was to intimidate and terrorize them today, and tomorrow every social category that resists, including workers, nurses, teachers, deliverymen, cultural workers, young people, and every citizen who resists, our response is: We will be here, standing up and strong, and we will stand by every social group and citizen that you target with your policies! We will be here, no matter what happens. We will stand strong to defend democracy and justice in this country!
