We have a new election with a new and different electoral system. In this contest, there are only two alternative plans of governance, power, and programs being contested. These two programs reflect two different concepts and visions for Greece. Our vision, the vision of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, and the vision of New Democracy. Our vision is for a country and society of humanity, democracy, and justice. A country and society where all people will live and be measured equally. An economy where the wealth produced will grow and be shared fairly among citizens. A country where children and future generations will have equal opportunities for education, health, work, and progress.
