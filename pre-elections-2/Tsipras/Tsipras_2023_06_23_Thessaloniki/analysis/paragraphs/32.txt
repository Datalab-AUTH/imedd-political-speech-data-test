But they got what they deserved: a lesson in responsibility, patriotism, and democracy from SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. Mr. Mitsotakis attempted to dig the SYRIZA pit, and in the end, he himself fell into it with the irresponsible games he tried to set up and play in Thrace. And he finally scapegoated his minority candidate. After all, Mr. Mitsotakis is a specialist in scapegoats. It is always not his fault, it is someone else's fault. It was his nephew's fault for the surveillance. He didn't know. It was the stationmaster's fault for the Tempe case. It's always somebody else's fault. Now it was three people's fault. He got three in this election, he got the Spiritualist, he got Cricket, he got Katradzi. If we had one more week of the election campaign, I don't know how many people would leave the ballot papers of the New Democracy!
