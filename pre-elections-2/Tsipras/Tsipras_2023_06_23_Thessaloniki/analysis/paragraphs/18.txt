This is what we did the day before yesterday regarding the tragic shipwreck of Pylos. This tragedy resulted in over 600 people being lost in the water, a watery grave. It is the deadliest shipwreck in the modern history of our country. When we asked how and why, we were told: "Don't speak, don't ask, don't breathe, keep quiet." Why? Because they were not rich, they were oppressed, they were outlaws. Because they were not Greeks, they were not even tourists, they were refugees. Well, we answer: Whatever they were, they were people! And when it comes to human life, when it comes to people, we will be there to ask questions and defend the dignity of human life. We have an obligation to our values and our culture to speak and ask questions. No matter how much they try to take away the oxygen of democracy, we will breathe humanity and solidarity. That is why we are here, to serve values, not to count the political cost. These are precisely the values we served as a government when we made our country a synonym for humanity around the globe. We faced the biggest migrant refugee crisis Europe has seen since World War II. The image of Greece was three old grandmothers holding the babies of refugees in their arms to give them a glass of milk and some bread to eat. That was the image of Greece when the Pope, the Patriarch, and the world public opinion were describing Greece as a country of humanity. Today, we will not allow some people to turn the country synonymous with humanity into a country synonymous with barbarism!
