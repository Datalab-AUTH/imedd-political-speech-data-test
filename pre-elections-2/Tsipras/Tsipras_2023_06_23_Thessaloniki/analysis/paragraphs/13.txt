This is exactly why New Democracy is trying to hide the hard and brutal core of its program from the electoral debate. They have been announcing things for two months now, both in the previous elections and in this election, that they have no intention of implementing, while hiding what they do intend to implement. But lies have short legs. They do not go far. But the truth goes all the way to Brussels. Because it is there, in Brussels, that Mr Mitsotakis submitted the real government program of New Democracy two months ago - the three-year binding Stability Program. So none of his election promises are included in it.
