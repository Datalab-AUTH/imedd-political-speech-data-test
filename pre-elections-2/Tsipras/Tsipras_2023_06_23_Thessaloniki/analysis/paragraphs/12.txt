This is the plan. This is our vision for Greece: a Greece of a just society and prosperity for all. Our plan stands against the programme of Mr Mitsotakis' right-wing party, which puts the profits of the few above the public interest, but also above the lives of the many. Mr Mitsotakis' programme wants growth to come through tax breaks for the few and powerful, hot money for the few and powerful, and the parallel reduction of labour costs. The eviction of the state from critical areas of social and economic life makes room for speculative funds. We are told that when the powerful and the funds increase their profits, then growth will come. And when growth comes, then we will all share the benefits together. This is the neoliberal recipe of New Democracy. But a recipe that has cost tears, blood, injustice, social destruction, wherever it has been applied on the planet. Cheap growth that leaves the great social majority on the sidelines, growth that respects neither the environment nor workers nor democracy, often neither human life nor natural nor human resources, is unsustainable growth. Unviable for the many. Doomed to produce crises, social tensions and a frightening widening of inequalities.
