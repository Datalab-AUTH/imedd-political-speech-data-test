To reverse this downward divergence from the core of European countries, a new national plan is needed to support social infrastructure and strong public and private investment. This plan is at the core of the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance programme, which is coherent, radical, but also realistic, with human resource development, healthy entrepreneurship, and justice at its core. It proposes a new model of production and economic development that makes room for innovation, knowledge, the fair distribution of resources, and the reduction of inequalities, supporting the needs of society, wage labor, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, stockbreeders, and young people. By closing the door to the logic of state-owned business, the bleeding of the state and the privileges of interdependence can be eliminated.
