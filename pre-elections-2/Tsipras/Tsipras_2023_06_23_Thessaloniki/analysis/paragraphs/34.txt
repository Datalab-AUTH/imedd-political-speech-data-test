So today, from the port of Thessaloniki, I want to send a message to enemies and friends from here, from our Macedonia. We, the core, the nucleus, the pillar, the basic force of the progressive and democratic Party of the country, do not play games with the homeland! Patriotism is not a partisan commodity for us. We do not put Greece on the market for a few thousand votes. We have never put political costs first, and we will never put political costs first. Instead, we will always put patriotic responsibility first, and we have proven this on our journey. We fought with the great powers of Europe, and we liberated our country from the memoranda. When our political opponents were shouting "Vasta Schaeuble" and "Gerun Gera", we did not forget that. We also established peace in the Balkans and security on our northern borders with the Prespa Agreement, and we are proud of that. However, the "Old Geruns" wore hlamys and ran to the rallies in the arms of Golden Dawn, and we do not forget that.
