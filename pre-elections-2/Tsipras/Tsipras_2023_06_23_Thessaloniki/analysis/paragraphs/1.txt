Citizens of Thessaloniki, we are once again joining together in this call for the struggle for democracy and justice. We are all here, present and united in this great and crucial struggle. Your presence here today is more important than ever before. As you know well in Thessaloniki, it is allowed to fall, but it is necessary to get up. And we are already up! We are on our feet, fighting for our ideals, values, and principles. We are fighting on behalf of the majority of Greek society, for justice and progress. Our weapons are our values, principles, dedication to justice, democracy, equality, and our love for humanity. Today, we are in the last turn of a difficult but beautiful battle, a crucial battle to overturn the correlations that were reflected in the ballot box of the simple proportional representation. We are all learned in these battles, accustomed to being present when democracy, the homeland, and justice demand it. No matter how much persecution, slander, or repression we face, we will continue to fight until the last second before the polls close. We know that these ballot boxes will determine who will govern this country for the next four years, with what program, means, and perspective. Sunday's elections will decide our lives for the next four years, but they will also decide the quality of our democracy. The dilemmas are tough, made tougher by the system of enhanced proportional representation, which gives a bonus of 50 seats to the first party. Because on Sunday, we do not have the second round of the previous contest.
