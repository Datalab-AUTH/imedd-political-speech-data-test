But I also want to say a few words about the parties' strategies. Our strategy is not only about the programmes being debated. Our strategy is a strategy of democracy, civil society, accountability, programmatic debate, participation, inclusion, and dialogue. The strategy of New Democracy is the opposite. They do not just want to win the elections; they want to weaken at all costs the party that may be staring them in the face the next day, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance. Their main goal is to have a fragmented opposition of progressive and powerless parties. Their strategy can be summed up in three words: Divide and conquer! They found a great opportunity in the stance of the other progressive parties on simple proportional representation, a stance that paved the way for an unexpected electoral result for New Democracy. Because we had the hand of cooperation outstretched to the progressive forces, and they were looking at how to cut the hand of cooperation. And they didn't care that they were thus paving the way for Mitsotakis and the Right.
