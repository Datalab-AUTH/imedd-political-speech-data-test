And in order to avoid discussing our programs and positions, they did not hesitate to put even our critical and sensitive national issues at the center of the political debate in the electoral arena. The sensitive national issue of Thrace and the minority has been brought up, along with their audacity, lies, ethnic cleansing, and the NIS, which they have used as a pawn to divide the country. They have taken us back to dark times, where one side calls the other a traitor, as we have seen in the past during the Schism, National Schism, Civil War, and post-Civil War state. This Right is not the New Democracy of 2023, but rather the ERE of the 1950s, with intolerance and division, labeling their political opponents as "national exception," SYRIZA MPs as "minority," and half of the Greeks as having a "reduced national conscience."
