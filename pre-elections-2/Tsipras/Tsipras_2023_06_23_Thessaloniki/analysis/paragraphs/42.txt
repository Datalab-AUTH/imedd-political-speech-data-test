So let's convince those who did not vote in May to vote in June because the correlation that will emerge on Sunday is crucial to everyone's lives. And because, you know, no contest is decided before the people have made their final decision with their vote. I therefore call on you to fight this battle to the last second, to overturn the correlations, to achieve a winning result. I invite you to go together with optimism because Syriza is not a flare. It is the representative of hope, of the social majority. Because SYRIZA has been and is here in the difficult times, so let us stand up armed with our ideas, our values, with the weapons of democracy, speech, and vote, with the justice of our positions. With these weapons, we will fight the battle on Sunday in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every home, to reclaim every vote. I call on you to fight the battle of our ideas and values, the fight for democracy, the fight for dignity. And we will stand together. We will continue this struggle until our eternal, final victory. Be well! Good strength! Good fight! I told you from the very first moment that your presence here today is more important and more critical than any other presence. We therefore invite you to fight this battle, the battle of our ideas, of our values, the battle of democracy, the battle of social dignity. Let us fight it standing up, and we must remain on our feet. We will be here, together, fighting the battles for society. I thank you from the depths of my soul for this support, for this optimism, for this stubbornness, for this determination. Strength and fight! Goodbye!
