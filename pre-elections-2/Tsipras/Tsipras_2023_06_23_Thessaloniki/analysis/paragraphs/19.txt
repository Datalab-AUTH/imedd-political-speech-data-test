Our differences, citizens of Thessaloniki, with our political opponents, are based on values, but they are not only in the realm of ideas. These differences are also reflected in every aspect of social and economic life. They are reflected in the everyday life of citizens, in labor relations, in eight-hour working hours, in employment rights, in health, in education, in energy, in water, and in primary housing. A few years ago, we were the ones who, with consistency, honesty, determination, and patriotism, made difficult decisions with the aim and guiding principle of protecting society and the social majority. We made difficult decisions and kept the country at the heart of Europe, in the eurozone. But today we say that this is not enough. It is not enough that we stayed in Europe. It is not enough to stay in Europe. We must finally become Europe. Because we are not Europe in wages, in rights, in the rule of law, in transparency, or in the efficiency of the state. We are not Europe in hospitals, in schools, in universities, or in infrastructure. That is why we are setting a national goal for the next four years and for the next decade, I would say, for Greece to stop deviating from the average of the countries of the European Union. To become Europe.
