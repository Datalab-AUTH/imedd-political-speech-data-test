A person with a disability can live, work, play, and have fun like everyone else in a country where truth is not persecuted and diversity is seen as an asset, not a handicap. The horizons of each and every person will not be determined by birth, whether they were born rich or poor, in the center or in the periphery, but will open up and expand according to their needs and potential.
