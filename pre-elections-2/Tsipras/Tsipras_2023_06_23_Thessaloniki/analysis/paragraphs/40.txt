Mitsotakis started out as a politician who wanted to be like Macron, and ended up being a politician - a carbon copy of Orban of Hungary. He has the same views on immigration policy, the same views on critical foreign policy issues, and the same management of the rule of law with predator, wiretapping, and the NIS at his beck and call. Therefore, I want to say that the only ones who can prevent the "Orbanization" of the country, the transformation of Greece into Hungary, and the transformation of Greece into a weak democracy are the Greek people with their vote on the coming Sunday.
