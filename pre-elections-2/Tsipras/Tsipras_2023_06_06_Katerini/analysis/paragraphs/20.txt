And I urge all of you to unite in this struggle. I particularly want to address those who did not vote for SYRIZA but realize that what is coming is very difficult and want to resist the prospect of an all-powerful or self-reliant New Democracy. I urge them to realize that there is no other choice at this time. The plan of the right is to vote for small parties. Anywhere else, the challenge can go to the New Democracy government as long as it does not go to SYRIZA. They want the opposition to be fragmented and divided so that they can go unchecked the next day.
