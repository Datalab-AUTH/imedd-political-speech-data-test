I wonder, who were the people able to spend 60 billion? Where did that money go? What is left today to act as a buffer against the crisis? A refuge, a support for the majority of society? Look at the state of public hospitals. Look at the state of public schools. I come from Lagada in Thessaloniki, where children are taught in containers. Look at the state of the welfare state, social welfare.
