We call on all of you, despite any disagreements or reservations you may have with us, to unite your strength and voice on June 25th at the SYRIZA ballot box. This will make us as strong as possible and prevent social plunder. Together, we can achieve a turnaround and we will do everything possible to make it happen. Bless you and thank you very much. Good strength and good fight! Remember, the only losers are those who do not fight. We will fight this battle until the end. Bye!
