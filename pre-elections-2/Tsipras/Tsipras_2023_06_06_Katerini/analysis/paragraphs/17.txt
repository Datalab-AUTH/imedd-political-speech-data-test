But we will be here to stand by the 700,000 families who are now worried that they may lose their homes because 700,000 mortgages have been transferred to funds by the banks, and a tsunami of foreclosures is expected the next day. The funds bought these loans at 20% of the value and want to get 100%. Yesterday, I was reading another news story about a disabled man in Halkidiki who is still living out of his house because he was a guarantor on a loan for his unemployed son. In Upper Petrelona, a mother of a single-parent family with her disabled child was evicted. The solidarity of the neighborhood and ordinary people was mobilized, and the crows were evicted, but he remains and is still in jail. These images will be everyday life for the next four years.
