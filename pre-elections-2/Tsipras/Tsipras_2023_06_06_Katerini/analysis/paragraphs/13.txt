And I see that KINAL is just as bad. He says all they care about is becoming caliphs again at some point in the place of the caliph. They don't care if Mitsotakis and New Democracy rule. They do not care at all. If they did care, they would also give their hand of complicity so that we don't miss the great opportunity of simple proportional representation. In fact, they even said during the pre-election that they would have no problem working with New Democracy, only their face was missing.
