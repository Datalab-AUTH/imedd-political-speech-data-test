Who can convince us of that? Here is the great truth that must be put on the table in this election debate. We respect the popular verdict of the ballot box on the twenty-first of May, but it was a ballot box with a simple proportional representation in which we had a vision, but were strategically locked in. We had a vision to change the political system, to have governments of cooperation based on programmatic convergences. However, when we shook hands with the other progressive forces, they looked to cut off our hand and made a one-front attack on SYRIZA instead of dealing with the one who governs and implements their policies. Today, we have another ballot box before us, not with a simple proportional representation, but with an enhanced proportional representation and 50 bonus seats. What does this enhanced proportional representation ballot box say? Whoever comes out first will rule us for another four years. What are the alternative programmatic plans being opposed in this ballot?
