I am concerned today as I was coming to Katerini and read a news item in the media. Yesterday in Kos, a 63-year-old woman drowned in the back of a farm truck as she was being taken to the hospital. And why was she being transported in the back of a farm truck? Kos has had three ambulances since we were there, but there is no staff to operate them. I ask myself, is it possible that in 2023 our fellow human beings will be treated like dogs on a truck because there is no care, concern, or funds to ensure that every person, wherever they are, in every corner of our country, feels safe?
