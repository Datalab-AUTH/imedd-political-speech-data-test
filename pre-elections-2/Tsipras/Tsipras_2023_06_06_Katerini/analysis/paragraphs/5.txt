That is why it is worthwhile, even during this election period, to put the major problems that concern Greek society at the center of the debate, since we did not succeed in doing so in the previous election. These are the significant issues that must concern us. We have governed in very difficult circumstances, perhaps the most challenging circumstances ever experienced by a government in this country. Yet, with our mistakes and failures, we managed to get the country out of the memoranda and guardianship, regulate the public debt, and leave 37 billion in the public coffers. That is what we have achieved. We did not have the leeway to spend 60 billion, as those who came after us did. We had the obligation to put almost 40 billion in the public coffers to get the country out of the memoranda and bankruptcy, and we did it honestly and with integrity.
