Unfortunately, nothing has been done with this 60 billion, which was an opportunity for the country after a decade of crisis to heal the wounds in society. The big question is where are we going? What is the next day? What's the way forward? I am determined to bring the big issues into the debate. One is public healthcare. The second, which concerns all of you regardless of what you voted for in the election, is the big issue of income looting. The big issue of the price tag is also important. In the third week of the month, income is being saved, and we can no longer afford to pass the supermarket as the revaluations are daily. So, how will the big issue of price competitiveness be addressed?
