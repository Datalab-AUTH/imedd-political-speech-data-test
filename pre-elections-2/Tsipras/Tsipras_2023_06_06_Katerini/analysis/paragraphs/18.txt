So that's why we say we have 15 years ahead of us... 3 weeks. In these 3 weeks, we have to do everything in our power to reverse these correlations. Not, I repeat, for our party's interest, but for the social interest, to stop seeing images like this in Ano Petralona, Halkidiki, and Kos. To stop seeing these images of people freezing to death in the backs of farm cars because there is no ambulance service. To put an end to this obscenity, to this precision.
