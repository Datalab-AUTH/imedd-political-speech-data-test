But we will address other issues. We will also raise the issue of pensions. We will bring up the fact that they promised to keep the 13th, which we gave them in '18, but they cut it. They have not given back the retroactive payments that the State Council decided. So we will fight the battle so that retirees, the people who have fought for their jobs, can have dignity. That is the word: dignity. Although the pension may have stayed the same from '19 to today, with only a 7% increase that we voted for in '18, the crucial point is that statistics actually show, according to Eurostat, that those with an income of up to 700 euros have suffered a 40% reduction in their purchasing power. This means that the pension in '23 is 40% less than the pension in '19. Therefore, we will be here to stand by these people and those who are out of work.
