We say that we will stand up and call on the Greek people to support us because the country needs a strong force of social resistance. We will not allow an uncontrolled and all-powerful right-wing party to take the heat of poverty and social plunder. The country needs a strong force of resistance. We will fight until the last second to overturn the correlations because we know and have seen it, and we suffered it at the last ballot box. Four days ago, the polls were showing different correlations. At the ballot box, only 20% of citizens decided. We will fight until the last second to overturn the correlations. In any case, we promise to be here together, standing up, to fight for the farmer, the worker, the employee, the unemployed, and the young people because the future lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the future ahead of us will not be easy, and we need to hold in our hands... How did the poet put it? To keep water in our handfuls for there are wild months ahead. We will be here and fight together.
