And I want to close by saying this: During the election campaign, Mr Mitsotakis's top man, the former adviser to the Association of Greek Industrialists, Mr Skertos, who has come to Maximou with an agenda, told us that it's not a play and laugh. The Pissarides plan, if you recall, is to dismantle the middle class. He told us that our program is not costed and he included an old paper, right and left, which was supposedly an official map of the General Accounting Office of the State. You can see how crooked they are. It was a scrap of paper that he made on his computer and supposedly contained the signatures of the General Accounting Office. When I said the day before yesterday, "Mr. Mitsotakis, let's go to the general accounting office, let's go to the budget office of the House of Representatives, to any independent body you want, and our program, and your program, and cost it. But come on the next day and let's have a public open televised debate, the two of us, the whole Greek people to hear our proposals, which are the two alternative programs that will be judged at the ballot box." His answer was no to both. He is afraid to discuss and afraid to take this old paper to be costed to an official body. But you can't get very far with a lie. Lying has short legs. I am sure the Greek people will realize this. I hope they will realize it as soon as possible. We will fight for it until the last moment.
