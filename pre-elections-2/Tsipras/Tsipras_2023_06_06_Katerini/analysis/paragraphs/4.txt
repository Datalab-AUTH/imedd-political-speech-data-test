In December 2019, we left the national healthcare system to serve it, leaving behind 108,000 workers, including doctors and nurses. In the past six months, since December 2012, the number has decreased from 108,000 to 84,000. Despite the pandemic and the need to strengthen the national healthcare system, we have reduced staff. The people who left were not replaced, and today, all over Greece, we are experiencing a situation of disintegration of public hospitals. You are well aware of this situation here in Katerini, especially during the pandemic period, with the negative records of losses of our fellow human beings.
