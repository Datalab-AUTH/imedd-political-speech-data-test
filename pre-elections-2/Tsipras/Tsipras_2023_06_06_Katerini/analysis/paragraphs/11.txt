I no longer see anything else. I see what Mr. Mitsotakis is implementing - who talks about obscenities, who talks about private interests, who talks about privatization, even for water privatization, who talks about dismantling the National Health System, who talks about precision and no other way, and an alternative plan, which is the plan of Syriza. I don't see any other alternative plans from other parties.
