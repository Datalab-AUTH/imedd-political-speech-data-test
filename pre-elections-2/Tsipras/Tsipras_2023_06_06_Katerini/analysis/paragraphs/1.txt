Thank you very much for the warm welcome. I am delighted to see you all here today, standing strong and determined as ever, especially since it has been a long time since I last visited Katerini. We stand strong and determined not for our party's interests, but for the interests of society. We need a force that will support these interests, stand up for them, and fight for the public good.
