Mr. Mitsotakis tells us that he has not raised taxes for 4 years now. There is no bigger lie. 4.5 billion in taxes were raised, but they were raised on the many, the middle class, and the weak. Because when you have a scary accuracy like the one we have had in the last 2 years, when the household basket goes from €50 to €100, you don't need to increase tax rates to increase taxes, you just need to keep them constant. When the household basket goes from €50 to €100, the tax paid by the citizen doubles. When it goes from €50 needed to fill up a tank at the gas station to €100, the tax paid by the citizen doubles when indirect tax rates are kept constant. So now here's 4.5 billion in '22 more revenue and 1.5 billion in '23 in the first quarter. 6 billion more taxes have been imposed by Mr. Mitsotakis with this policy. He told us that the crisis, of course, and the accuracy were imported. Yes, but the obscenity was Greek because the Commission recommended that all EU countries should reduce their indirect tax rates. Do you know which ones alone did not reduce them? 3 countries. Slovakia, Malta, and Greece. Only 3 countries have not reduced their indirect tax rates.
