Thank you very much for the warm welcome. I am delighted to see you all here today, standing strong and determined as ever, especially since it has been a long time since I last visited Katerini. We stand strong and determined not for our party's interests, but for the interests of society. We need a force that will support these interests, stand up for them, and fight for the public good.

I am concerned today as I was coming to Katerini and read a news item in the media. Yesterday in Kos, a 63-year-old woman drowned in the back of a farm truck as she was being taken to the hospital. And why was she being transported in the back of a farm truck? Kos has had three ambulances since we were there, but there is no staff to operate them. I ask myself, is it possible that in 2023 our fellow human beings will be treated like dogs on a truck because there is no care, concern, or funds to ensure that every person, wherever they are, in every corner of our country, feels safe?

So, this is what a just society means and what prosperity for all means, which is our motto in this election. A just society and prosperity for all mean that not only those in urban centers and those who can afford it will be able to save their lives if something happens to them, but every citizen should have access to it.

In December 2019, we left the national healthcare system to serve it, leaving behind 108,000 workers, including doctors and nurses. In the past six months, since December 2012, the number has decreased from 108,000 to 84,000. Despite the pandemic and the need to strengthen the national healthcare system, we have reduced staff. The people who left were not replaced, and today, all over Greece, we are experiencing a situation of disintegration of public hospitals. You are well aware of this situation here in Katerini, especially during the pandemic period, with the negative records of losses of our fellow human beings.

That is why it is worthwhile, even during this election period, to put the major problems that concern Greek society at the center of the debate, since we did not succeed in doing so in the previous election. These are the significant issues that must concern us. We have governed in very difficult circumstances, perhaps the most challenging circumstances ever experienced by a government in this country. Yet, with our mistakes and failures, we managed to get the country out of the memoranda and guardianship, regulate the public debt, and leave 37 billion in the public coffers. That is what we have achieved. We did not have the leeway to spend 60 billion, as those who came after us did. We had the obligation to put almost 40 billion in the public coffers to get the country out of the memoranda and bankruptcy, and we did it honestly and with integrity.

I wonder, who were the people able to spend 60 billion? Where did that money go? What is left today to act as a buffer against the crisis? A refuge, a support for the majority of society? Look at the state of public hospitals. Look at the state of public schools. I come from Lagada in Thessaloniki, where children are taught in containers. Look at the state of the welfare state, social welfare.

Unfortunately, nothing has been done with this 60 billion, which was an opportunity for the country after a decade of crisis to heal the wounds in society. The big question is where are we going? What is the next day? What's the way forward? I am determined to bring the big issues into the debate. One is public healthcare. The second, which concerns all of you regardless of what you voted for in the election, is the big issue of income looting. The big issue of the price tag is also important. In the third week of the month, income is being saved, and we can no longer afford to pass the supermarket as the revaluations are daily. So, how will the big issue of price competitiveness be addressed?

Mr. Mitsotakis tells us that he has not raised taxes for 4 years now. There is no bigger lie. 4.5 billion in taxes were raised, but they were raised on the many, the middle class, and the weak. Because when you have a scary accuracy like the one we have had in the last 2 years, when the household basket goes from €50 to €100, you don't need to increase tax rates to increase taxes, you just need to keep them constant. When the household basket goes from €50 to €100, the tax paid by the citizen doubles. When it goes from €50 needed to fill up a tank at the gas station to €100, the tax paid by the citizen doubles when indirect tax rates are kept constant. So now here's 4.5 billion in '22 more revenue and 1.5 billion in '23 in the first quarter. 6 billion more taxes have been imposed by Mr. Mitsotakis with this policy. He told us that the crisis, of course, and the accuracy were imported. Yes, but the obscenity was Greek because the Commission recommended that all EU countries should reduce their indirect tax rates. Do you know which ones alone did not reduce them? 3 countries. Slovakia, Malta, and Greece. Only 3 countries have not reduced their indirect tax rates.

They are now trying to convince us, day and night, with alchemy and lies, that if they reduce the value-added tax, they will favor the rich. Do they really care so much about not favoring the rich, those who have given EUR 10 billion directly, EUR 15 billion in direct contracts to day laborers, and EUR 10 billion in subsidies that go directly to the energy, refining, and supermarket cartels?

Who can convince us of that? Here is the great truth that must be put on the table in this election debate. We respect the popular verdict of the ballot box on the twenty-first of May, but it was a ballot box with a simple proportional representation in which we had a vision, but were strategically locked in. We had a vision to change the political system, to have governments of cooperation based on programmatic convergences. However, when we shook hands with the other progressive forces, they looked to cut off our hand and made a one-front attack on SYRIZA instead of dealing with the one who governs and implements their policies. Today, we have another ballot box before us, not with a simple proportional representation, but with an enhanced proportional representation and 50 bonus seats. What does this enhanced proportional representation ballot box say? Whoever comes out first will rule us for another four years. What are the alternative programmatic plans being opposed in this ballot?

I no longer see anything else. I see what Mr. Mitsotakis is implementing - who talks about obscenities, who talks about private interests, who talks about privatization, even for water privatization, who talks about dismantling the National Health System, who talks about precision and no other way, and an alternative plan, which is the plan of Syriza. I don't see any other alternative plans from other parties.

The KKE is not interested in how the country will be governed. It says that they are all the same - those who implement the dismantling of labor relations, those who want collective agreements, and those who want a wage increase. They only care about growing their own field.

And I see that KINAL is just as bad. He says all they care about is becoming caliphs again at some point in the place of the caliph. They don't care if Mitsotakis and New Democracy rule. They do not care at all. If they did care, they would also give their hand of complicity so that we don't miss the great opportunity of simple proportional representation. In fact, they even said during the pre-election that they would have no problem working with New Democracy, only their face was missing.

We say that we will stand up and call on the Greek people to support us because the country needs a strong force of social resistance. We will not allow an uncontrolled and all-powerful right-wing party to take the heat of poverty and social plunder. The country needs a strong force of resistance. We will fight until the last second to overturn the correlations because we know and have seen it, and we suffered it at the last ballot box. Four days ago, the polls were showing different correlations. At the ballot box, only 20% of citizens decided. We will fight until the last second to overturn the correlations. In any case, we promise to be here together, standing up, to fight for the farmer, the worker, the employee, the unemployed, and the young people because the future lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the future ahead of us will not be easy, and we need to hold in our hands... How did the poet put it? To keep water in our handfuls for there are wild months ahead. We will be here and fight together.

We will put the tax issues on the table because, as the Commission said, the end of benefits is in '23. What happens after that? How will people live if VAT doesn't go down? If there isn't a cap on the profitability of the energy, refining, and supply chain cartels? How do we move forward exactly?

But we will address other issues. We will also raise the issue of pensions. We will bring up the fact that they promised to keep the 13th, which we gave them in '18, but they cut it. They have not given back the retroactive payments that the State Council decided. So we will fight the battle so that retirees, the people who have fought for their jobs, can have dignity. That is the word: dignity. Although the pension may have stayed the same from '19 to today, with only a 7% increase that we voted for in '18, the crucial point is that statistics actually show, according to Eurostat, that those with an income of up to 700 euros have suffered a 40% reduction in their purchasing power. This means that the pension in '23 is 40% less than the pension in '19. Therefore, we will be here to stand by these people and those who are out of work.

But we will be here to stand by the 700,000 families who are now worried that they may lose their homes because 700,000 mortgages have been transferred to funds by the banks, and a tsunami of foreclosures is expected the next day. The funds bought these loans at 20% of the value and want to get 100%. Yesterday, I was reading another news story about a disabled man in Halkidiki who is still living out of his house because he was a guarantor on a loan for his unemployed son. In Upper Petrelona, a mother of a single-parent family with her disabled child was evicted. The solidarity of the neighborhood and ordinary people was mobilized, and the crows were evicted, but he remains and is still in jail. These images will be everyday life for the next four years.

So that's why we say we have 15 years ahead of us... 3 weeks. In these 3 weeks, we have to do everything in our power to reverse these correlations. Not, I repeat, for our party's interest, but for the social interest, to stop seeing images like this in Ano Petralona, Halkidiki, and Kos. To stop seeing these images of people freezing to death in the backs of farm cars because there is no ambulance service. To put an end to this obscenity, to this precision.

And I want to close by saying this: During the election campaign, Mr Mitsotakis's top man, the former adviser to the Association of Greek Industrialists, Mr Skertos, who has come to Maximou with an agenda, told us that it's not a play and laugh. The Pissarides plan, if you recall, is to dismantle the middle class. He told us that our program is not costed and he included an old paper, right and left, which was supposedly an official map of the General Accounting Office of the State. You can see how crooked they are. It was a scrap of paper that he made on his computer and supposedly contained the signatures of the General Accounting Office. When I said the day before yesterday, "Mr. Mitsotakis, let's go to the general accounting office, let's go to the budget office of the House of Representatives, to any independent body you want, and our program, and your program, and cost it. But come on the next day and let's have a public open televised debate, the two of us, the whole Greek people to hear our proposals, which are the two alternative programs that will be judged at the ballot box." His answer was no to both. He is afraid to discuss and afraid to take this old paper to be costed to an official body. But you can't get very far with a lie. Lying has short legs. I am sure the Greek people will realize this. I hope they will realize it as soon as possible. We will fight for it until the last moment.

And I urge all of you to unite in this struggle. I particularly want to address those who did not vote for SYRIZA but realize that what is coming is very difficult and want to resist the prospect of an all-powerful or self-reliant New Democracy. I urge them to realize that there is no other choice at this time. The plan of the right is to vote for small parties. Anywhere else, the challenge can go to the New Democracy government as long as it does not go to SYRIZA. They want the opposition to be fragmented and divided so that they can go unchecked the next day.

We call on all of you, despite any disagreements or reservations you may have with us, to unite your strength and voice on June 25th at the SYRIZA ballot box. This will make us as strong as possible and prevent social plunder. Together, we can achieve a turnaround and we will do everything possible to make it happen. Bless you and thank you very much. Good strength and good fight! Remember, the only losers are those who do not fight. We will fight this battle until the end. Bye!
