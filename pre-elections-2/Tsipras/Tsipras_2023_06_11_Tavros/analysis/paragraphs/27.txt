Just as it is shameful that every day, work accidents and industrial accidents are recorded. In 2023, there were 57 deaths and 57 industrial accidents, with the most recent being the death of a worker in the Perama zone. This is where the devaluation of trade unions, encouragement of employer arbitrariness, and dismantling of control mechanisms lead. If there were a strong ACPC, employers would prioritize safety conditions, knowing they could be audited and face expensive fines. But there is nothing now. We still hear the shocking message from the widow of the worker in Perama who lost his life, telling us that we can no longer play with human lives. "Mercy. Enough!" she said.
