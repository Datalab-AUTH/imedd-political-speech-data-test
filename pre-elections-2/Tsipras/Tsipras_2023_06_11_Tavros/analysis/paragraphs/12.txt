Friends, comrades, and colleagues, there are obviously serious issues and significant challenges facing the labor and trade union movement, and we will not hide from them. However, we will not do any favors for those who seek to abolish unions altogether, or for those who seek to eliminate the concept of workers' demands and collective action. Our vision of a fair society involves representing and fighting for the interests of the working majority, and we have demonstrated this commitment in difficult times.
