The Ministry of Labour was a steadfast ally on the side of workers during the difficult years of the memorandum guardianship. We rolled up our sleeves and fought to do the impossible: to get the country out of the memorandum guardianship and the bankruptcy that others had thrown it into. We washed the dirty laundry of decades and fought through constant negotiation with our creditors to represent and defend the rights of society and workers. During this battle, the Ministry of Labour stood by the workers and reconstructed and substantially upgraded the Labour Inspectorate. However, after the 2019 elections, the Inspectorate was abolished and became an Independent Authority, essentially not existing to protect workers or enforce labor regularity and safety rules at work. We fought battles to restore collective bargaining, increase the minimum wage immediately after leaving the memoranda, and abolish the racist minimum wage for young people. We also made efforts to avoid invisible workers and defend the eight-hour working week and collective agreements.
