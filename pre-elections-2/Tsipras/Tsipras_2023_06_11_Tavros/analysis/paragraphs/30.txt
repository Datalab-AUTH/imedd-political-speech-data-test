Comrades, thanks to SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance and its choices, the country stood upright in the very critical period of 2015-19. But for us, our medal, if you like, and our pride, are not only that the country stood upright, but that at the same time, society did not collapse, society was not flattened. That was not self-evident. Society stood up together with the country. The popular strata stood upright. In conditions of extreme economic and social crisis, we achieved much more than even our friends could have imagined. The dignity of the citizens and, of course, the ability to take difficult, brave, big decisions that brought the country out of bankruptcy, I repeat, without the disintegration of society. And I want to conclude this intervention today by saying that we are proud of this. We are proud that we managed to keep society standing and that at the same time, we managed to make historic choices, doing our duty to the country and to history.
