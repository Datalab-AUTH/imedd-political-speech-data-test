New Democracy's plan is to "vote for anything but SYRIZA, because if you vote for SYRIZA, we risk losing the elections." In any case, we risk having someone the next day who can look us in the eye for not implementing our unpopular, anti-social policies. So we call on progressives, democratic citizens, not to do them any favors. We call on the world of work, especially the world of work, all those who know that they may have reservations about us, all those who know that there are disagreements about us, to consider how important it is for a party to go from 5% to 6%, from 7% to 8%. And how much more important it is to reverse these correlations, to have a winning result against Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. And in any case, the next day we must be present and present in the great struggle to defend labor and social rights against a neoliberal avalanche, an attack on rights, an attack on society.
