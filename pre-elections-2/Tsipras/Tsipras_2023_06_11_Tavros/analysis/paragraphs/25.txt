I want to remind you that during the toughest fiscal years, when the last euro was controlled by third parties, we hired 300 permanent staff in the ambulance service, while they didn't even have one. However, 560 employees have left during this four-year period. This was a choice, not a mistake. The choice was to devalue the NHS. Why? Because Greece is the only country that gives such a large share to the private sector in healthcare. Private services and clinics are emerging one after the other, being bought by large investment funds that come to the country not as strategic investors, but to make a three-year or five-year cycle and sell for even more money. I will not bore you with figures, but Greece has 35% of its health expenditure in private spending, while the European average is 15%. Greece has twice less public per capita spending on healthcare than the European average.
