SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance was not found as the main body or pillar of the progressive party in our country due to an electoral situation, but precisely because it expresses, continues to express, and will continue to express these social needs. That is why we say and repeat: we are and will be here as the main representatives of the social needs of the working classes and the interests of our people.
