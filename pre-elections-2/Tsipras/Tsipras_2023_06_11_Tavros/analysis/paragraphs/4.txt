This attack, which we have seen taking shape in legislative frameworks over the past four years and being institutionalized, is bound to intensify even more after the June 25 elections. This is particularly true if the same correlation of power is recorded as that which was recorded in the ballot box for the simple proportional representation on May 21. That is why we must fight and do our utmost to reverse this correlation. We must fight until the last vote, until the last second before the polls close, to reverse this correlation.
