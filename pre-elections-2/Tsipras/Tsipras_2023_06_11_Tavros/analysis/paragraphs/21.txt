And it was the European Commission itself that recommended to all member states to reduce indirect taxation. The only countries in Europe that did not do this were Malta, Slovakia, and Mitsotakis' Greece. And they did not do this because they had a plan. They didn't do it by mistake. The plan was to tax the middle class and the weak because the ratio of indirect to direct taxes has reached an overwhelming 60% in indirect taxes. This shows that we are a rather third-world country in terms of the way we manage taxes and public finances. This is not the case in serious European countries. So 60-40 is the ratio. This was done for a purpose: so that there would be fiscal availability, fiscal space available to give targeted subsidies, which the citizen would think are being done for him, but they are being done to go specifically into the pockets of the energy, refining, supply chain cartels to keep prices high.
