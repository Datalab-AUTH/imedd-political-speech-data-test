But comrades, it is not only the cost of life. At the core of our ideology is not only the cost of life, but also our plan and program to make it bearable and reduce it. At the core of our ideology is human life itself. I would like to say a few words at this point because, tragically, Greek society has recently experienced the collapse of the NHS. It is a devaluation of human life when we see how cheaply we treat it. In three days, we have lost three fellow human beings, three of our fellow citizens, in the same tragic way: a 63-year-old woman lost her life in Kos, run off like a dog in the back of a farm car because there was no ambulance; the next day in Nea Makri, a 19-year-old pregnant woman lost both her and her child because the ambulance never arrived; the same happened in Halkidiki.
