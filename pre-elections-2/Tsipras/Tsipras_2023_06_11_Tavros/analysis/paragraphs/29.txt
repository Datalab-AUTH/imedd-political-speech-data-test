We declare today that regardless of the election result, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance puts labor rights first for equality, dignity, and prosperity. There should be no more living wage of terror. Every workplace should become a space for the expression of human creativity and freedom. We aim for higher wages and stable working conditions, and for strong unions. Yes, we must make this our goal: strong unions on the side of society, fighting for work with rights, for the right to work, for a life worth living, for a just society for all and for all.
