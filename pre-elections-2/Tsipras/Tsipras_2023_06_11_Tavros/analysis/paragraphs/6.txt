And we have pursued it during difficult times. And I want to remind you that today is a significant anniversary, a negative anniversary, but it means something. That we got to where we are through struggle and that we will continue to do so. Ten years ago today, the coalition government of New Democracy and PASOK at the time, Samaras and Venizelos, closed ERT, putting it under blackmail. We supported the struggles of the workers, of POSPERT, and the struggles of the Greek people. As we did then with ERT, we did with every small and big struggle. And it was this that gave SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance its momentum and perspective.
