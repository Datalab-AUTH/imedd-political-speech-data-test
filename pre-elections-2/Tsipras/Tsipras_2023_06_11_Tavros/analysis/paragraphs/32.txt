And here it is important to say one more thing, so that all citizens, and especially progressive citizens, can understand it. Those who understand very well what we are saying when we say that the next day will be very difficult if Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy is re-elected, and therefore if it is given a blank cheque to continue an unpopular policy, let alone if this correlation is repeated and it is re-elected with an air of omnipotence. So I want to say this: This election before us is not a simple proportional representation election. It is an election under the system of enhanced proportional representation, meaning that the first to finish will get 50 bonus seats, as has always been the case. So this time, every progressive citizen, every citizen who understands the great risk, even if they are not a progressive, democratic citizen - because it is not only a question of having a strong society, but also of having a stable political system, a healthy democracy - every citizen who fully understands the risk to democracy, for society, for the political system, by the repetition of the correlation that was recorded in the ballot box of the simple proportional representation, must know that every vote that will not be directed to SYRIZA but to other smaller parties, objectively, is a vote that favours the planning of New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis' plan. Because the design of New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis is one: The fragmentation of forces, so that the next day there is no rival.
