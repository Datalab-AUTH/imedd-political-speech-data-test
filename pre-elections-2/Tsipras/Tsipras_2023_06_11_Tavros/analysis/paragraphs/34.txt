I am sure that we will emerge from this battle stronger, comrades. I am confident that, like all of us, you will do what needs to be done in the next 15 days. I am also certain that the progressive and democratic world will recognize the high stakes of June 25th. These stakes are whether the country will have a government and a program that will give society a breath of fresh air the next day, or whether it will have a government and a program that will plunder labor, health, and education. We will fight to secure the right of the Greek people and society to a just and prosperous society for all! The right to work, the right to a welfare state. We will fight this battle decisively, from whatever position we hold. Today, tomorrow, and always, on the front line! Take care. Goodbye.
