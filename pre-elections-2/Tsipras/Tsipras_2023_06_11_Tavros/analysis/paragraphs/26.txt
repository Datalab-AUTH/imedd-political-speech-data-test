The Mitsotakis plan, which he told us in December '19 would make us shudder with its approach to health care, has now been revealed by Mr. Pneumatikos. Their plan involves everything being on the market. Those who can afford to go to a private clinic will do so, while the public health care system will also be semi-privatized. Mr. Pneumatikos stated that health care is too expensive, so they plan to make hospitals Public Law Entities with managers in order to reduce spending. Patients with a negative prognosis will not receive treatment and will be screened, following the American model. This is an inhumane model, which is why we are fighting to demand not only a better cost of living, but also to defend the right to life itself. The dismantling of public health care primarily affects working people, those who cannot afford to pay and citizens who have been paying taxes for years but are left on their own at critical moments. This is a disgrace to our country.
