SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is not a firework. We have been in battle positions for a decade in defense of society. It has been in battle positions for a decade, not as a party of protest, nor as a party complementary to the right-wing government. It is as a party of power that claims governance for the benefit of the forces of society. This is what it will be in the aftermath of the election, this is what it is today, in the 15 days left. We are fighting and will fight for a victorious election result. And I want to remind you: we did not come to power as a party of power by luck or by chance, but because we expressed social needs with determination, with boldness, and we demanded that a government program of protection for the weak, for wage labor, for the underprivileged Greeks be implemented.
