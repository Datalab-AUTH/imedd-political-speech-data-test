In the midst of the national disaster of the Tempi accident, the voice of the workers and their unions was an oasis. They broke the government's attempt at cover-up and disorientation from the very first moment. Their message was one of hope and optimism, showing that not everything is covered by propaganda mechanisms and that there is resistance. Greek society, and I personally as a member of SYRIZA, owe a big thank you to these railway trade unionists who did not hesitate to take on the mechanisms of lies and continue to fight for safe and public transport in the service of the Greek people.
