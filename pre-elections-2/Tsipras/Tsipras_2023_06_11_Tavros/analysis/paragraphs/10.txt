But there are moments when reality itself shows the limits of this policy. No one can forget, however much some say we forget easily in this country - it was a few months ago - the arrogant form in Parliament of Mr. Karamanlis of Tempe, who, in Parliament, with the familiar arrogant style of the new right, disregarded the warnings not only of the MPs of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, but also disregarded the warnings of the workers, the successive letters of apology sent to him by the railway workers and their unions about the state of deterioration of the Greek railways. Warnings that were, if you like, a foreshadowing of this tragic development, this tragic accident.
