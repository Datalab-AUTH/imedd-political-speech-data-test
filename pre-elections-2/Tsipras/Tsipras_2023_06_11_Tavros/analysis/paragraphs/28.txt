Well, that's what we say: Enough with the degradation of human life. Enough! On June 25th, we must fight the battle to defend life. On June 25th, we must put a stop to their plans to further degrade human life. On June 25th, we must fight to strengthen the rights of working people, laborers, and the rights of every Greek man and woman to a decent life. This is our message. Dignity, security, life. This is our message. This is our message and plan, from whatever position we find ourselves in. And we must implement this plan together, with the working people and trade unionists who will be on the front line of the struggle.
