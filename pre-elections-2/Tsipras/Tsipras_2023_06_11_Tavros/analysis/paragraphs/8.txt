But I want to say one more thing in relation to the battle ahead of us. I said earlier that we will fight until the last vote to overturn this correlation, to win. Not because our party interests dictate this, but because the interests of society dictate this. In any case, however, and I want to emphasize this, we will fight until the polls close at the last second and vote by vote, because it is very crucial for the next day that there is a strong opponent who can look Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy in the eye and fight to prevent the neoliberal onslaught on society and work.
