But the repeal of the Hatzidakis law is not enough to change the labor market landscape. Today, with the intensity of the crisis problem, the inflationary crisis, the crisis of price inflation that is plundering income, we also need immediate measures to protect workers' incomes and enable them to live with dignity. Every euro lost in the whirlwind of inflation is a euro stolen from the pockets of the world of wage earners. It is frankly outrageous to see the representatives of New Democracy, Mr Mitsotakis himself and his colleagues, telling us that cutting VAT, indirect taxation on food will favor the rich.
