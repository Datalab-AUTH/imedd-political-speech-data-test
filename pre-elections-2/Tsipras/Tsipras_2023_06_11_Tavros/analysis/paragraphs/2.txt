I am here, and we are here, to renew our programmatic and constitutional commitment to the interests of the working classes of the country, but also to listen. We want to hear from you what we are doing well, but above all, what we need to do better. You have seen that in this election period, in a new phase, in a new context where the ballot box on June 25th will decide the next four years for our country. It will decide, if you like, not just parties, but our lives for the next four years. Who and with what program will govern in the next four years? It is also a ballot box with enhanced proportional representation, which is a different logic from the previous ballot box. So, in this effort, you will have realized, you will have seen, we are doing what we have always done as a party, but we are doing it with great speed. We are changing on the move, correcting our weaknesses and mistakes. That is why I would like us to have this opportunity to exchange ideas and thoughts. SYRIZA is a party that is social, popular, but also open to the messages of society.
