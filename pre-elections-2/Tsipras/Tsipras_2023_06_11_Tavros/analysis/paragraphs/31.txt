But today, once again, we have a difficult race ahead of us. It is as difficult as those crucial moments when the outcome I described to you earlier was not certain. It was by no means certain that we would be able to achieve both objectives: to keep the country standing and to save society from being flattened. I would say that with the stories of probabilities, it was much more uncertain and much more difficult than the task we have now - the difficult struggle we have ahead of us between now and June 25th to overturn the correlations that went to the ballot box on May 21st. That is why we have experience, and in difficult times, it is we who come forward, who stand up, united, determined to fight the battle. So we will fight, we will fight as we know how to fight, until June 25th, until the last second, vote by vote, first and foremost because we know that this is not a fight, I repeat, for our party's interests. It is a fight for society, for the popular strata, for the underprivileged, who need to have strong support against the onslaught of anti-people policies that are damaging to their interests and the public interest.
