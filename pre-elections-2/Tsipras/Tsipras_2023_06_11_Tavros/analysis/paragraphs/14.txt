It is certainly no coincidence that this is where the systematic effort of New Democracy under Mr. Mitsotakis to dismantle the welfare state began, starting with Mr. Hatzidakis' anti-worker and anti-social law. This law, which went beyond individual regulations, had at its heart a strategic choice: to turn work from a right into a privilege, to make the relationship between employer and employee an individual affair, and to undermine the foundation of human dignity, namely the eight-hour workday, which has been the foundation of human dignity for decades, if not centuries, and from where all the great labor struggles began.
