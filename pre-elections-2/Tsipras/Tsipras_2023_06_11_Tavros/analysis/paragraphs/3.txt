The world of wage labor and the labor movement in our country are in the crosshairs of an ideological and political attack, my friends. This attack has been even more intense in our country. Trade unionism, the organization of workers, the strike, and the demand have been treated as opponents of progress and development in all the previous years, but especially in the last four years. We know the results: a labor market dominated by employer promiscuity, flexible working relations, insecurity, and individualization. This attack on workers' rights has been going on for decades, but especially in the last four years.
