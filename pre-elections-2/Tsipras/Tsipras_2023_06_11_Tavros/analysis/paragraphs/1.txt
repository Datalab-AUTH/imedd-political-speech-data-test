Friends, hello. Thank you very much for this warm welcome. It is crucial for us to be here today with representatives of working people, trade unionists of the working class, and wage laborers. These social strata are the reason why we are here, to represent their interests and fight for them. We are here to fight for the interests of society. I am delighted about our meeting today and want to declare from the outset our firm commitment to the problems, anxieties, and aspirations of the world of wage labor. The people who produce wealth with their labor are the social and political backbone of our party, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance.
