And it is indeed amazing that they are trying to convince us that they have not imposed taxes in the four years they have been in power. In the last 16 months alone, through the maintenance of high VAT, they have collected 6 billion more taxes than the majority of society. Because when the household basket doubles and becomes 50 or 100 euros, you do not need to increase the tax rate to double taxes. You just have to keep it at the same level. When you used to fill your car tank with 50 and now you have to fill it with 100, you don't have to increase the tax rate to collect more tax. All you have to do is leave it at the same level.
