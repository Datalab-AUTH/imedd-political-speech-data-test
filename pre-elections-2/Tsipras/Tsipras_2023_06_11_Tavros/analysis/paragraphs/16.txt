We want a just society and prosperity for all, as our motto says. There can be no just society and prosperity for all when workers do not have defined and inalienable rights. It cannot exist when everyone is not equal before the law and lacks security. Therefore, it is crucial for us that workers have rights. It is crucial that no one feels alone and unprotected in the face of arbitrariness. It is crucial that the rules apply to everyone, both the weak and the strong.
