{"text_en": "Friends, hello. Thank you very much for this warm welcome. It is crucial for us to be here today with representatives of working people, trade unionists of the working class, and wage laborers. These social strata are the reason why we are here, to represent their interests and fight for them. We are here to fight for the interests of society. I am delighted about our meeting today and want to declare from the outset our firm commitment to the problems, anxieties, and aspirations of the world of wage labor. The people who produce wealth with their labor are the social and political backbone of our party, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance.\n\nI am here, and we are here, to renew our programmatic and constitutional commitment to the interests of the working classes of the country, but also to listen. We want to hear from you what we are doing well, but above all, what we need to do better. You have seen that in this election period, in a new phase, in a new context where the ballot box on June 25th will decide the next four years for our country. It will decide, if you like, not just parties, but our lives for the next four years. Who and with what program will govern in the next four years? It is also a ballot box with enhanced proportional representation, which is a different logic from the previous ballot box. So, in this effort, you will have realized, you will have seen, we are doing what we have always done as a party, but we are doing it with great speed. We are changing on the move, correcting our weaknesses and mistakes. That is why I would like us to have this opportunity to exchange ideas and thoughts. SYRIZA is a party that is social, popular, but also open to the messages of society.\n\nThe world of wage labor and the labor movement in our country are in the crosshairs of an ideological and political attack, my friends. This attack has been even more intense in our country. Trade unionism, the organization of workers, the strike, and the demand have been treated as opponents of progress and development in all the previous years, but especially in the last four years. We know the results: a labor market dominated by employer promiscuity, flexible working relations, insecurity, and individualization. This attack on workers' rights has been going on for decades, but especially in the last four years.\n\nThis attack, which we have seen taking shape in legislative frameworks over the past four years and being institutionalized, is bound to intensify even more after the June 25 elections. This is particularly true if the same correlation of power is recorded as that which was recorded in the ballot box for the simple proportional representation on May 21. That is why we must fight and do our utmost to reverse this correlation. We must fight until the last vote, until the last second before the polls close, to reverse this correlation.\n\nSYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is not a firework. We have been in battle positions for a decade in defense of society. It has been in battle positions for a decade, not as a party of protest, nor as a party complementary to the right-wing government. It is as a party of power that claims governance for the benefit of the forces of society. This is what it will be in the aftermath of the election, this is what it is today, in the 15 days left. We are fighting and will fight for a victorious election result. And I want to remind you: we did not come to power as a party of power by luck or by chance, but because we expressed social needs with determination, with boldness, and we demanded that a government program of protection for the weak, for wage labor, for the underprivileged Greeks be implemented.\n\nAnd we have pursued it during difficult times. And I want to remind you that today is a significant anniversary, a negative anniversary, but it means something. That we got to where we are through struggle and that we will continue to do so. Ten years ago today, the coalition government of New Democracy and PASOK at the time, Samaras and Venizelos, closed ERT, putting it under blackmail. We supported the struggles of the workers, of POSPERT, and the struggles of the Greek people. As we did then with ERT, we did with every small and big struggle. And it was this that gave SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance its momentum and perspective.\n\nSYRIZA-Progressive Alliance was not found as the main body or pillar of the progressive party in our country due to an electoral situation, but precisely because it expresses, continues to express, and will continue to express these social needs. That is why we say and repeat: we are and will be here as the main representatives of the social needs of the working classes and the interests of our people.\n\nBut I want to say one more thing in relation to the battle ahead of us. I said earlier that we will fight until the last vote to overturn this correlation, to win. Not because our party interests dictate this, but because the interests of society dictate this. In any case, however, and I want to emphasize this, we will fight until the polls close at the last second and vote by vote, because it is very crucial for the next day that there is a strong opponent who can look Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy in the eye and fight to prevent the neoliberal onslaught on society and work.\n\nThis is what Mr. Mitsotakis' Right wants - to not have a strong opponent the next day, so that they can plunder social and labor rights with greater ease. They want to impose a policy that does not take people into account, but only profits.\n\nBut there are moments when reality itself shows the limits of this policy. No one can forget, however much some say we forget easily in this country - it was a few months ago - the arrogant form in Parliament of Mr. Karamanlis of Tempe, who, in Parliament, with the familiar arrogant style of the new right, disregarded the warnings not only of the MPs of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, but also disregarded the warnings of the workers, the successive letters of apology sent to him by the railway workers and their unions about the state of deterioration of the Greek railways. Warnings that were, if you like, a foreshadowing of this tragic development, this tragic accident.\n\nIn the midst of the national disaster of the Tempi accident, the voice of the workers and their unions was an oasis. They broke the government's attempt at cover-up and disorientation from the very first moment. Their message was one of hope and optimism, showing that not everything is covered by propaganda mechanisms and that there is resistance. Greek society, and I personally as a member of SYRIZA, owe a big thank you to these railway trade unionists who did not hesitate to take on the mechanisms of lies and continue to fight for safe and public transport in the service of the Greek people.\n\nFriends, comrades, and colleagues, there are obviously serious issues and significant challenges facing the labor and trade union movement, and we will not hide from them. However, we will not do any favors for those who seek to abolish unions altogether, or for those who seek to eliminate the concept of workers' demands and collective action. Our vision of a fair society involves representing and fighting for the interests of the working majority, and we have demonstrated this commitment in difficult times.\n\nThe Ministry of Labour was a steadfast ally on the side of workers during the difficult years of the memorandum guardianship. We rolled up our sleeves and fought to do the impossible: to get the country out of the memorandum guardianship and the bankruptcy that others had thrown it into. We washed the dirty laundry of decades and fought through constant negotiation with our creditors to represent and defend the rights of society and workers. During this battle, the Ministry of Labour stood by the workers and reconstructed and substantially upgraded the Labour Inspectorate. However, after the 2019 elections, the Inspectorate was abolished and became an Independent Authority, essentially not existing to protect workers or enforce labor regularity and safety rules at work. We fought battles to restore collective bargaining, increase the minimum wage immediately after leaving the memoranda, and abolish the racist minimum wage for young people. We also made efforts to avoid invisible workers and defend the eight-hour working week and collective agreements.\n\nIt is certainly no coincidence that this is where the systematic effort of New Democracy under Mr. Mitsotakis to dismantle the welfare state began, starting with Mr. Hatzidakis' anti-worker and anti-social law. This law, which went beyond individual regulations, had at its heart a strategic choice: to turn work from a right into a privilege, to make the relationship between employer and employee an individual affair, and to undermine the foundation of human dignity, namely the eight-hour workday, which has been the foundation of human dignity for decades, if not centuries, and from where all the great labor struggles began.\n\nWe, comrades and friends, have committed ourselves to making the restoration of labor normality our main priority. Our programmatic commitment is to annul and overturn the Hatzidakis law. This is not just a catchy phrase about labor issues, but rather our strategic objective. Our pursuit is in the exact opposite direction.\n\nWe want a just society and prosperity for all, as our motto says. There can be no just society and prosperity for all when workers do not have defined and inalienable rights. It cannot exist when everyone is not equal before the law and lacks security. Therefore, it is crucial for us that workers have rights. It is crucial that no one feels alone and unprotected in the face of arbitrariness. It is crucial that the rules apply to everyone, both the weak and the strong.\n\nBut the repeal of the Hatzidakis law is not enough to change the labor market landscape. Today, with the intensity of the crisis problem, the inflationary crisis, the crisis of price inflation that is plundering income, we also need immediate measures to protect workers' incomes and enable them to live with dignity. Every euro lost in the whirlwind of inflation is a euro stolen from the pockets of the world of wage earners. It is frankly outrageous to see the representatives of New Democracy, Mr Mitsotakis himself and his colleagues, telling us that cutting VAT, indirect taxation on food will favor the rich.\n\nIt is infuriating that New Democracy is using a Trump strategy and running a campaign similar to the Republican campaign in the US. It seems as though they are addressing citizens in Alabama rather than citizens in a European country like Greece.\n\nIt is infuriating. They make things black and white, and they tell the biggest lie by presenting it as the biggest truth. With the terrifying support of the media, they can present the biggest lie as the biggest truth.\n\nAnd it is indeed amazing that they are trying to convince us that they have not imposed taxes in the four years they have been in power. In the last 16 months alone, through the maintenance of high VAT, they have collected 6 billion more taxes than the majority of society. Because when the household basket doubles and becomes 50 or 100 euros, you do not need to increase the tax rate to double taxes. You just have to keep it at the same level. When you used to fill your car tank with 50 and now you have to fill it with 100, you don't have to increase the tax rate to collect more tax. All you have to do is leave it at the same level.\n\nAnd it was the European Commission itself that recommended to all member states to reduce indirect taxation. The only countries in Europe that did not do this were Malta, Slovakia, and Mitsotakis' Greece. And they did not do this because they had a plan. They didn't do it by mistake. The plan was to tax the middle class and the weak because the ratio of indirect to direct taxes has reached an overwhelming 60% in indirect taxes. This shows that we are a rather third-world country in terms of the way we manage taxes and public finances. This is not the case in serious European countries. So 60-40 is the ratio. This was done for a purpose: so that there would be fiscal availability, fiscal space available to give targeted subsidies, which the citizen would think are being done for him, but they are being done to go specifically into the pockets of the energy, refining, supply chain cartels to keep prices high.\n\nSo whoever continues to insist on this inconceivable propaganda that cutting indirect taxes will benefit the rich should try saying that one day during a visit to a supermarket. Let them dare to say that to children who work ten-hour days to be able to afford the basics. To the kids who work ten-hour days and have seen their rent go up, double and triple and can't get past a supermarket. Let them tell that to those who know better than anyone how hard it is to make the last euro, which they easily scorn with these public statements.\n\nBut comrades, it is not only the cost of life. At the core of our ideology is not only the cost of life, but also our plan and program to make it bearable and reduce it. At the core of our ideology is human life itself. I would like to say a few words at this point because, tragically, Greek society has recently experienced the collapse of the NHS. It is a devaluation of human life when we see how cheaply we treat it. In three days, we have lost three fellow human beings, three of our fellow citizens, in the same tragic way: a 63-year-old woman lost her life in Kos, run off like a dog in the back of a farm car because there was no ambulance; the next day in Nea Makri, a 19-year-old pregnant woman lost both her and her child because the ambulance never arrived; the same happened in Halkidiki.\n\nWhat does it all mean? They didn't have the fiscal capacity when, precisely because of the pandemic, they were given the opportunity to spend beyond and outside any fiscal constraints - for the first time in the country since we entered EMU - 60 billion? Fifteen billion has gone into direct awards and closed tenders, ten billion has gone into subsidizing the energy cartels. And they couldn't afford to hire 600-700 rescuers for the ambulance service? They hired 1,000 police officers for the university police, to go outside the university lecture halls. And of course, they had nothing to do with them and they turned people back to where they were supposed to be, which was the police stations. But they didn't have 600-700 rescuers to hire.\n\nI want to remind you that during the toughest fiscal years, when the last euro was controlled by third parties, we hired 300 permanent staff in the ambulance service, while they didn't even have one. However, 560 employees have left during this four-year period. This was a choice, not a mistake. The choice was to devalue the NHS. Why? Because Greece is the only country that gives such a large share to the private sector in healthcare. Private services and clinics are emerging one after the other, being bought by large investment funds that come to the country not as strategic investors, but to make a three-year or five-year cycle and sell for even more money. I will not bore you with figures, but Greece has 35% of its health expenditure in private spending, while the European average is 15%. Greece has twice less public per capita spending on healthcare than the European average.\n\nThe Mitsotakis plan, which he told us in December '19 would make us shudder with its approach to health care, has now been revealed by Mr. Pneumatikos. Their plan involves everything being on the market. Those who can afford to go to a private clinic will do so, while the public health care system will also be semi-privatized. Mr. Pneumatikos stated that health care is too expensive, so they plan to make hospitals Public Law Entities with managers in order to reduce spending. Patients with a negative prognosis will not receive treatment and will be screened, following the American model. This is an inhumane model, which is why we are fighting to demand not only a better cost of living, but also to defend the right to life itself. The dismantling of public health care primarily affects working people, those who cannot afford to pay and citizens who have been paying taxes for years but are left on their own at critical moments. This is a disgrace to our country.\n\nJust as it is shameful that every day, work accidents and industrial accidents are recorded. In 2023, there were 57 deaths and 57 industrial accidents, with the most recent being the death of a worker in the Perama zone. This is where the devaluation of trade unions, encouragement of employer arbitrariness, and dismantling of control mechanisms lead. If there were a strong ACPC, employers would prioritize safety conditions, knowing they could be audited and face expensive fines. But there is nothing now. We still hear the shocking message from the widow of the worker in Perama who lost his life, telling us that we can no longer play with human lives. \"Mercy. Enough!\" she said.\n\nWell, that's what we say: Enough with the degradation of human life. Enough! On June 25th, we must fight the battle to defend life. On June 25th, we must put a stop to their plans to further degrade human life. On June 25th, we must fight to strengthen the rights of working people, laborers, and the rights of every Greek man and woman to a decent life. This is our message. Dignity, security, life. This is our message. This is our message and plan, from whatever position we find ourselves in. And we must implement this plan together, with the working people and trade unionists who will be on the front line of the struggle.\n\nWe declare today that regardless of the election result, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance puts labor rights first for equality, dignity, and prosperity. There should be no more living wage of terror. Every workplace should become a space for the expression of human creativity and freedom. We aim for higher wages and stable working conditions, and for strong unions. Yes, we must make this our goal: strong unions on the side of society, fighting for work with rights, for the right to work, for a life worth living, for a just society for all and for all.\n\nComrades, thanks to SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance and its choices, the country stood upright in the very critical period of 2015-19. But for us, our medal, if you like, and our pride, are not only that the country stood upright, but that at the same time, society did not collapse, society was not flattened. That was not self-evident. Society stood up together with the country. The popular strata stood upright. In conditions of extreme economic and social crisis, we achieved much more than even our friends could have imagined. The dignity of the citizens and, of course, the ability to take difficult, brave, big decisions that brought the country out of bankruptcy, I repeat, without the disintegration of society. And I want to conclude this intervention today by saying that we are proud of this. We are proud that we managed to keep society standing and that at the same time, we managed to make historic choices, doing our duty to the country and to history.\n\nBut today, once again, we have a difficult race ahead of us. It is as difficult as those crucial moments when the outcome I described to you earlier was not certain. It was by no means certain that we would be able to achieve both objectives: to keep the country standing and to save society from being flattened. I would say that with the stories of probabilities, it was much more uncertain and much more difficult than the task we have now - the difficult struggle we have ahead of us between now and June 25th to overturn the correlations that went to the ballot box on May 21st. That is why we have experience, and in difficult times, it is we who come forward, who stand up, united, determined to fight the battle. So we will fight, we will fight as we know how to fight, until June 25th, until the last second, vote by vote, first and foremost because we know that this is not a fight, I repeat, for our party's interests. It is a fight for society, for the popular strata, for the underprivileged, who need to have strong support against the onslaught of anti-people policies that are damaging to their interests and the public interest.\n\nAnd here it is important to say one more thing, so that all citizens, and especially progressive citizens, can understand it. Those who understand very well what we are saying when we say that the next day will be very difficult if Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy is re-elected, and therefore if it is given a blank cheque to continue an unpopular policy, let alone if this correlation is repeated and it is re-elected with an air of omnipotence. So I want to say this: This election before us is not a simple proportional representation election. It is an election under the system of enhanced proportional representation, meaning that the first to finish will get 50 bonus seats, as has always been the case. So this time, every progressive citizen, every citizen who understands the great risk, even if they are not a progressive, democratic citizen - because it is not only a question of having a strong society, but also of having a stable political system, a healthy democracy - every citizen who fully understands the risk to democracy, for society, for the political system, by the repetition of the correlation that was recorded in the ballot box of the simple proportional representation, must know that every vote that will not be directed to SYRIZA but to other smaller parties, objectively, is a vote that favours the planning of New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis' plan. Because the design of New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis is one: The fragmentation of forces, so that the next day there is no rival.\n\nNew Democracy's plan is to \"vote for anything but SYRIZA, because if you vote for SYRIZA, we risk losing the elections.\" In any case, we risk having someone the next day who can look us in the eye for not implementing our unpopular, anti-social policies. So we call on progressives, democratic citizens, not to do them any favors. We call on the world of work, especially the world of work, all those who know that they may have reservations about us, all those who know that there are disagreements about us, to consider how important it is for a party to go from 5% to 6%, from 7% to 8%. And how much more important it is to reverse these correlations, to have a winning result against Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. And in any case, the next day we must be present and present in the great struggle to defend labor and social rights against a neoliberal avalanche, an attack on rights, an attack on society.\n\nI am sure that we will emerge from this battle stronger, comrades. I am confident that, like all of us, you will do what needs to be done in the next 15 days. I am also certain that the progressive and democratic world will recognize the high stakes of June 25th. These stakes are whether the country will have a government and a program that will give society a breath of fresh air the next day, or whether it will have a government and a program that will plunder labor, health, and education. We will fight to secure the right of the Greek people and society to a just and prosperous society for all! The right to work, the right to a welfare state. We will fight this battle decisively, from whatever position we hold. Today, tomorrow, and always, on the front line! Take care.

Private services and clinics are emerging one after the other, being bought by large investment funds that come to the country not as strategic investors, but to make a three-year or five-year cycle and sell for even more money.

Their plan involves everything being on the market. Those who can afford to go to a private clinic will do so, while the public health care system will also be semi-privatized. Mr. Pneumatikos stated that health care is too expensive, so they plan to make hospitals Public Law Entities with managers in order to reduce spending. Patients with a negative prognosis will not receive treatment and will be screened, following the American model. This is an inhumane model, which is why we are fighting to demand not only a better cost of living, but also to defend the right to life itself.

I would say that with the stories of probabilities, it was much more uncertain and much more difficult than the task we have now - the difficult struggle we have ahead of us between now and June 25th to overturn the correlations that went to the ballot box on May 21st. That is why we have experience, and in difficult times, it is we who come forward, who stand up, united, determined to fight the battle. So we will fight, we will fight as we know how to fight, until June 25th, until the last second, vote by vote, first and foremost because we know that this is not a fight, I repeat, for our party's interests.

So I want to say this: This election before us is not a simple proportional representation election. It is an election under the system of enhanced proportional representation, meaning that the first to finish will get 50 bonus seats, as has always been the case. So this time, every progressive citizen, every citizen who understands the great risk, even if they are not a progressive, democratic citizen - because it is not only a question of having a strong society, but also of having a stable political system, a healthy democracy - every citizen who fully understands the risk to democracy, for society, for the political system, by the repetition of the correlation that was recorded in the ballot box of the simple proportional representation, must know that every vote that will not be directed to SYRIZA but to other smaller parties, objectively, is a vote that favours the planning of New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis' plan.
