Of course, we are told that we will tax refineries and energy companies, and I really want to ask you: do any of you have a refinery? Do any of you have any energy companies, and are you afraid that we will tax you? They are afraid that we will tax them. They are right to be afraid. I was watching the other day, dear friends, a Bank of Greece report on bank deposits. What this report said was that 72.5% of deposits are up to €1,000, which is the vast majority of people, and 0.7% of deposits are more than €100,000. But what else? Critically, this 72.5% of deposits up to €1,000 is €2.6 billion in aggregate, while this 0.7% of deposits over €100,000 is €81 billion. €81 billion, 0.7%, and €2.6 billion, 72%. Well, Greece is a country of great contrasts. So, this is the Greece of Mr Mitsotakis. These are the contradictions, these are the great injustices, and we are coming to respond to these injustices with our programme, which says that there must be an end to obscenity. The rich must be taxed, and not the middle classes, and the poor must not be plundered with indirect taxes, such as value-added tax and excise duty.
