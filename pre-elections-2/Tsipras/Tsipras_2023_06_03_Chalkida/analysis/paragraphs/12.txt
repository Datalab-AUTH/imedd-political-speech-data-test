Therefore, we call on the citizens of Chalkida and the citizens of Evia to unite their voices with ours, to do everything possible to support society and its needs, to do everything possible in the remaining 20 days to reverse the trends and to provide perspective and hope for justice, so that the hope of justice in our country does not fade away. We have a great responsibility not to let it fade away. And we will not let it fade away.
