So we are here today to say that we have an obligation to stand against the conservative neoliberal juggernaut and overturn these plans, which have sometimes written off our people and sometimes written off Syriza. But they always calculated without the hotelier. I want to call on all of you to fight this battle until the last second, to convince the citizens of our program, and to do everything possible to overturn these correlations. We can overturn these correlations. On June 25th, the polls will be empty. Whether they will be filled differently than they were on May 21st is up to the work we do over the next 20 days.
