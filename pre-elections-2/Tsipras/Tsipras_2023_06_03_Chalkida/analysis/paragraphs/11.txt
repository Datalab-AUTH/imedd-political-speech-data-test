The new democracy and its propaganda apparatus want to turn citizens who did not vote for them before and will not vote for them now to smaller parties. Why? Because they want to be unchecked and have no force to stop them. We call on citizens who voted for smaller parties, those who abstained from the elections, and young people who abstained from the elections to unite their voice at the ballot box with the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance ballot paper. New Democracy is terrified of the prospect of SYRIZA overturning the correlations because they know it is possible. Citizens must realize that this time we are voting for our lives, and it is our lives that are being decided.
