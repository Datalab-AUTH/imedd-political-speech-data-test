So we will enter this electoral debate with our program and proposals, and we will tell the Greek people the truth. The truth is that it is not us who want to increase insurance contributions for freelancers and farmers. The truth is that we have brought two and a half million uninsured people into the national health system, and those who cannot afford to cover their insurance contributions are being left out of the services of the EOPYY. The truth is that we have a plan to settle the debts of small and medium-sized businesses and farmers by canceling part of the nominal debt and offering 120 installments. The truth is also that we do not have a plan to increase taxes for the many, but to reduce taxes on the indirect taxes of value-added tax and excise tax that have looted the income of households.
