And we owe it, especially to the people of Evia, to remind them not only of what right-wing means, but also of what injustice means. A policy that widens inequalities and injustice. I want to address something in particular to those people in North Evia. Today, I will go to North Evia to speak to those people who have seen their properties reduced to ashes in 10 days and have only seen promises of reconstruction for two years, but with no visible results. I also want to address the citizens of Chalkida, who are seeing the public infrastructure of their city crumble. I want to speak to the workers of South Evia and the workers in Mandoudi, an area that used to be full of life but is now in the midst of deindustrialisation and desertification. I want to refer to the people of South Evia who see an anarchic perspective through the wind turbines that are sprouting up everywhere without a plan. I want to refer to the people of Evia who see that there is no infrastructure, no road network, and above all, they see the great danger of unemployment drowning them. I want to say to all these citizens that on June 25th, regardless of whether they have disagreements with us or reservations about us, we should join forces because only by joining forces can we bring prospects and hope to your country and to the country.
