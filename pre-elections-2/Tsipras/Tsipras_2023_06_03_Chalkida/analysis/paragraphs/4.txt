However, the majority of Greek society did not hear our proposals but instead watched this debate about the cost of our program. Did you travel from the western regions to the popular neighborhoods of Athens? I proposed to Mr. Mitsotakis that we should take our programs together to the general accounting office of the state, to the budget office of the parliament, to whichever independent body would eventually cost them, and the next day he should not run away but come and discuss them publicly and openly in a television debate about the programs. So yesterday, the masks came off. He wants neither a costing of his program nor a TV debate; all he wants is to lie and propagandize. I wonder why the New Republic refuses to cost their own program? Why? Because it's a favor to us, the spokesman said yesterday. Mr. Skertsos stated that their program has been tabled in the medium term. The truth is that 90% of Mr. Mitsotakis' announcements have not been submitted in the medium term. It is good when the government tells us that it will show the average nominal wage in 2022 and the average real wage in 2022-23, that it will bring the average wage to â‚¬1500, and that without thawing the triennia without collective agreements, how will this be achieved? So we all know that the plan of the New Democracy of Mr. Mitsotakis is to widen inequalities, to widen the jungle, the labor jungle, and to give support to the powerful and not to the many.
