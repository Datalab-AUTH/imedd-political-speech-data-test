Of course, we understand the difficulty of a negative correlation, but citizens need to know what the alternative plans that are currently being opposed are. The alternative plans are those of the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis. They say tax breaks for the rich and taxes for the many, the non-existence of a welfare state, the dismantling of public health care, the dismantling of public infrastructure. On the other hand, the Syriza programme says that society must be supported, we must build up the public health care system, we must tackle the problem of poverty, we must strengthen income, we must stand by the farmer, the stockbreeder, the small and medium-sized entrepreneur. That is why we choose to fight this battle with our programme as our weapon. Before the election, Mitsotakis and his propaganda wanted to create the impression that SYRIZA's programme is supposedly over-budget. It does not come off. We were told that it costs 20, 40, 80 billion euros. Who are those who bankrupted the country in 2009? Do not forget that they left us in 2015 with empty coffers. We managed to get the country out of the memoranda and the crisis and left 37 billion in the public coffers. Who are those who owe the banks 400 million euros, borrowed and unloaned? They tell us that we do not know how to make calculations, that we do not owe the 1 â‚¬.
