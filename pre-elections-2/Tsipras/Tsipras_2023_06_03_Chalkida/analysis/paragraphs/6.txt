Mr Mitsotakis says that he has not raised taxes in these four years. The truth is that he has increased taxes by four and a half billion a year, through the maintenance of a high value added tax and excise tax, when it comes to the household basket. In fact, from €50 it goes to €100 and the tax rates are not reduced. Then the tax paid by the citizen doubles when filling up with petrol, going from €50 to €100. The tax paid by the citizen also doubles when the farmer purchases a bag of fertilizer that costs €50 and pays €150. This is the tax plunder that has affected the citizen, the farmer, the consumer, and everyone in the middle class. Mr Mitsotakis.
