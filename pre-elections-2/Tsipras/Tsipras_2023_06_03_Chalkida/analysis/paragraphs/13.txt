We should appeal to pensioners, defenders of working life, and tell them that under the new democracy, the pension they receive, although not reduced, has much less power. In 2019, they could go to the supermarket or give a gift to their grandchildren. They need to have a life with dignity, not just survive. We need to turn to small business owners and say that it's lies and propaganda that SYRIZA will increase contributions and adjust their debts. SYRIZA will give you what you need. We should address workers and say that it is in their class interest to have a force that will fight and implement a plan to restore collective agreements, increase wages, and restore the labor normality of justified dismissal so that workers are not dismissed without reason. Finally, we need to address the 700,000 households whose property and homes are threatened from auctions as they have passed their mortgages from the banks to the crows and funds. We need to tell them that what is coming is uncontrollable. It's a tidal wave, it's a tsunami. Mr. Georgiades said yesterday that it is old-fashioned to protect the first home. We say that social protection is not old-fashioned, it is called social plunder. Social illiteracy.
