I want to warmly thank you for your welcome in Chalcis. Thank you very much for the welcome and applause. Today, I am here in Chalkida, Evia, a region that knows all too well what injustice means. We are here to listen to the people, to listen to the citizens, and to put forward our proposals. We have a difficult struggle ahead of us in difficult circumstances, but you have known for years that our basic characteristic is that we do not give up. We fight with determination, even in the most difficult moments. We do not give up because what dominates our thinking is not party interests, but the fact that society is currently facing a great risk. Greek society needs support. Greek society needs a plan and a breathing program for the next day to tackle the great inequalities. Greek society, especially those forces such as wage earners, workers, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, farmers, and stockbreeders, need support in the next day. So we will do everything we can to reverse these correlations that we saw at the ballot box on May 21st.
