I also know that a critical issue for the vast majority of society is the issue of public health, and we all know what the situation is today in public hospitals. I will give you just one number. In December 2019, before the pandemic and after our own effort, despite the fact that we were under memoranda, those serving the National Health System - doctors, nurses, and staff - totalled 108,000. In December 2022, just 6 months ago, despite the pandemic, those serving the National Health System totalled 84,000. This is the reality today. And this is the reality because there is a plan behind all of this - the plan to privatize every inch of public space, privatize education, privatize health, privatize even water. And this is the plan they want to come and impose through a constitutional amendment for which they want, he says, to have 180 MPs.
