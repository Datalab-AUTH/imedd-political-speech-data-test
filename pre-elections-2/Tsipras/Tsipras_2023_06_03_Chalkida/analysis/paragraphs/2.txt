On June 25th, there will be a new election. On May 21st, we had a vision that we were unable to put into practice. Our vision was to change the political system by implementing a simple proportional representation system with the goal of cooperation between progressive forces. Unfortunately, all the other progressive forces were focused on their own interests instead of the future of the country. We extended our hand for cooperation, but they rejected it and chose to align with Mr. Mitsotakis instead. We have self-criticized and realized that this vision cannot be implemented anymore. The strategic choice of proportional representation has suffered a defeat, and we are now facing elections with a different electoral system. There is no simple proportional representation, and it may not exist for many years to come. In this election, we are using the system of enhanced proportional representation, which means that either one party or the other will rule.
