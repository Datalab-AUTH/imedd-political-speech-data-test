For these reasons, we call on every democratic and progressive citizen to support the SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, despite their disagreements and reservations, at the ballot box on Sunday. Because only the SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance can oppose the plan and programme of New Democracy with its own plan and programme. The reversal of the May election results on Sunday, with the decisive support of SYRIZA, citizens of Athens and friends, is not a matter of party expediency. It is a question of social stability and democratic normality.
