Because the correlation that will emerge on Sunday is crucial for all of our lives, and because I deeply believe it and have said it from the first moment we stood up to fight this battle: no contest is decided until the people decide it with their vote, and no fight is lost. Only those struggles that are not fought are lost. So I call on you to fight this fight until the last minute, with the aim of overturning the correlations and achieving a winning result. Nothing is decided until the last ballot box is closed on Sunday. That is why I call on you to be present at the ballot box and at the polling stations, in all polling stations, with electoral representatives, to be everywhere, to be there, to be more stubborn, stronger, and more determined than in previous elections. I call on all of you, with optimism and determination, to go together to fight this fight until the last ballot box is closed on Sunday. And from Monday, let us be together again. We will move forward together, in struggles alongside society and on behalf of the social majority. On behalf of all those we have represented for so many years in the Greek political arena. On behalf of the underprivileged, the unemployed, the young, and the working people. On behalf of the social majority.
