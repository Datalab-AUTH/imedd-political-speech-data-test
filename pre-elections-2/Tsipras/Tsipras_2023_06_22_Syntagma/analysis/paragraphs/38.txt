So today, we are sending a message to everyone from Syntagma Square: We do not play with the homeland! Greece is not expendable for us, nor do we put it up for sale for a few thousand votes. As always, we put patriotic responsibility above party and personal interests. We will protect and defend democracy to the end. We will stand here, strong and resolute, to support every social group and citizen threatened by the regime mentality of an unaccountable power. Today it is the minority, tomorrow it will be the workers, wage earners, nurses, teachers, delinquents, cultural workers, and young people. We will stand up against the practices of terror and intimidation of every social category. We will stand by every citizen and every social group that is threatened and wants to resist the plans to flatten it. If they threaten you that you will have four difficult years, we are here to guarantee that we will be by your side so that these four years will be four years of struggle and dignity for your rights!
