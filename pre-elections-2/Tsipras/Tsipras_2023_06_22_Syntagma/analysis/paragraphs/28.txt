We have a program that calls for a different productive model, one that is fair, inclusive, and sustainable. The program advocates for addressing poverty by strengthening incomes, including an immediate increase of the minimum wage to 880 euros and the introduction of annual indexation. Additionally, civil servants who have not seen an increase in 14 years should receive a 10% salary increase.
