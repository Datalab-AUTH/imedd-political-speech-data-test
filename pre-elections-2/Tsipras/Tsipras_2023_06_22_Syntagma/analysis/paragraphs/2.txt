That is what we are doing in this crucial battle, and we will do it with more conviction this time until the polls close on Sunday. We will not let a second go to waste without fighting to get the dilemma and the message across to society - our message and the dilemma of the ballot box. Because on Sunday, the elections will not only decide the winner and the loser, but they will also decide who will govern the country for the next four years and with which programme. They will also decide how social and political resistances will be organized in the next four years and, in short, they will decide the quality of our democracy, the conditions of our lives, and the future of all of us. They will decide what kind of Greece we and our children want to live in. The dilemmas at the ballot box are very tough because this time we are voting again under the enhanced proportional representation system. There are only two alternative plans for power and governance that are being pitted against each other on Sunday - two different plans, two different concepts, two different visions for Greece. Our vision is that of a country and a society of democracy and justice.
