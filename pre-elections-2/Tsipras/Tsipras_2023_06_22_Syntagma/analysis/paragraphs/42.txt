The goal of Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy, after the simple proportional representation ballot - which led to an obvious fragmentation of the progressive parties' forces - is to maintain this fragmentation the next day, in order to have a fragmented and powerless opposition. With many small parties in parliament, this does not stop them. Their plan is to discredit it. They say so openly and show it many times by favoring certain parties that help this design. But why do they do this? Because a degraded parliament with an ineffective opposition is the best condition not for a government that wants to govern democratically, but for a regime. The logic of divide and rule. This is the logic and strategy of New Democracy.
