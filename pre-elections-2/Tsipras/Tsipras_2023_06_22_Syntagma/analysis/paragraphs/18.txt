We citizens of Athens, my friends, have chosen sides in the dilemma of "humanity or barbarism". We are on the side of humanity and will remain so, no matter what. We stand with humanity, not with barbarism, because human life is valuable to us. We do not consider color, religion, ethnicity, or economic ability when defending human life, as we are all different but equal in this world. Therefore, we do not and will never account for political costs when defending our values of human life.
