A country where the horizons of each and every person are not determined at birth, whether they are born rich or poor, in the center or in the periphery. But the horizons will be open to all and will be shaped according to the needs and efforts of each and every individual. This is our vision for our country. For a Greece with a just society and prosperity for all. And we can put this vision into practice with a realistic and radical program that puts people, work, and social protection at the center. This is our vision and our program.
