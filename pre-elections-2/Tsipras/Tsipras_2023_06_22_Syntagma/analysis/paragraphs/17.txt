It foresees a further shrinkage of the welfare state and, in particular, a shrinkage of the NHS. That is why their MP, Mr Pneumatikos, has unwittingly revealed that the NHS will even be screening patients. Because the NHS will no longer have the expenditure or staff to meet the needs of citizens, and expensive treatments will be administered on the basis of patients' life expectancy. Anyone who does not have a life expectancy will not get an expensive treatment. He will go, if he can afford it, to private hospitals. And if he doesn't have money, he won't get treatment. But this cynical ideology, which measures everything in terms of cost and damage, especially when it comes to human lives, is leading us to a society of barbarism. And this is our fundamental difference with the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis. That is our fundamental difference. As the motto of our young people, the young people of Syriza, says, 'they talk about costs and damage, we talk about human lives?' That is our difference.
