Dear friends, comrades, and citizens of Athens, Sunday's election is not a continuation of the previous one; it is a new contest. The dilemmas this time are tough, but we are not the ones making them. The electoral system of enhanced proportional representation, which gives 50 bonus seats to the first party, sets the dilemmas. The Greek people will have to choose between two programs and two alternative strategies on Sunday. Our strategy is one of strong democracy, pluralism, civil society, participation, accountability, meritocracy, inclusion, and dialogue. That is our strategy.
