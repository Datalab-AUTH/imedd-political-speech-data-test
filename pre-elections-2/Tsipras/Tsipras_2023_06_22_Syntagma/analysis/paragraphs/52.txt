The fact that we have filled this square today is more important than any other time we have filled it. Today is one of the most important moments, and it will be one of the most important moments on Monday because we will have a good, victorious result. We will be stronger, more determined, and more stubborn. We will never become an adjunct to the plans of our political opponents. Here, we will be an obstacle to their plans of flattening, and we will stand by every citizen and every social group in need. SYRIZA is the mature child of social need. So let's go together until victory. Goodbye!
