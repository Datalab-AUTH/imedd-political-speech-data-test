Well, if we want to become Europe, it's not enough to stay where we are. We need to reverse Greece's divergence from the core of European countries. This requires a new national plan to support social infrastructure and strong strategic public and private investment strategies. The programme of SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance is precisely this plan. It has at its core the utilization of human potential, modernity, and social justice. It advocates a new model of economic development that respects the environment and the natural resources of our country, makes room for innovation and knowledge, and promotes the fair distribution of resources while reducing inequalities. It supports the needs of society, wage labor, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, stockbreeders, and young people, while closing the door to the logic of state-led entrepreneurship.
