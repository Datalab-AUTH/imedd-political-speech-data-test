Citizens of Athens, comrades, friends, we are all here once again, present and accounted for in the democratic call to struggle. We are here to defend principles and values, to fight against subversion, and to ensure that the hope of justice, equality, and solidarity in this land is not extinguished. We are here to fight this battle. As the saying goes, it is allowed to fall, but it is imperative to get back up. And we are already on our feet. We are already standing, and we will continue to stand to defend our values, principles, and ideals. This fight is more valuable, more crucial, and more useful than any other fight. We are all present, and even more so, because we have learned to fight when times are tough. We have learned to go against the current and to overturn correlations for the benefit of the forces of the social majority.
