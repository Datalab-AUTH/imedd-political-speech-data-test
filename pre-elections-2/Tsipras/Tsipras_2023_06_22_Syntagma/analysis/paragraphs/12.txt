On the other hand, we have a plan - the plan of our political opponents - which prioritizes profits and celebrates the market. It wants the role of the state to be increasingly reduced, counting profits and losses more than human lives. It is a plan and program that wants growth to come through tax breaks for the powerful and a permanent reduction in labor costs - from the withdrawal of the state from critical areas of social and economic life to make room for speculative funds. They believe that when the powerful and the funds increase their profits, growth will supposedly come. However, this growth has never come anywhere where these neoliberal ideas have been applied. It is cheap, non-inclusive growth that respects neither the environment nor workers, nor natural nor human resources. This unsustainable growth is doomed to decline and reproduce crises, social tensions, and a terrifying widening of inequalities.
