Today, from Constitution Square, the square of popular struggles and democracy, I would like to address the democratic people of the country, every progressive and democratic citizen, whatever they voted in the May elections, at this ballot box, to support democracy. Support the stability and health of democracy and our political system, and put a brake on the creation of an uncontrolled regime. I call on every democratic, progressive citizen to support a project of justice against the project of reduced wages, reduced rights, reduced expectations. Support the upgrading of public education and its officials, and stand up against the plan for supermarket universities and an education that depends on everyone's wallet, against the plan to revise Article 16, so that education, too, becomes a place of speculation for big interests.
