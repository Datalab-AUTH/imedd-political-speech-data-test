Citizens of Athens, friends, our differences with our political opponents - because for us there is only one political opponent, we are the backbone, the pillar of the progressive party of the country - and our opponent will always be the Right, the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis. Our differences with our political opponents are above all value-based, but they are also reflected in every aspect of social and economic life: in labor relations, the eight-hour working day, labor rights, health, education, energy, water, and primary housing. We want health, education, electricity, and water as public goods. They want - they said it, they did not hide it, they said it in their conceit and arrogance - 180 MPs to change the Constitution. Why do they not tell us exactly what they want to change in this Constitution? Do they want to establish health, education, electricity, and water as areas of speculation? We will be here, stronger than ever, to stop them!
