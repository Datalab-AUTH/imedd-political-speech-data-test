So we call from here, from the square of our people's struggles, the square where the struggles for the Constitution, freedom, and democracy were fought. We call on every progressive and democratic citizen to reflect on what the design of the New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis is, and which choices objectively help this design. Which choices at the ballot box objectively help this planning? And which choice is preventing this planning? The only option that prevents it is the decisive strengthening of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, so that Mr. Mitsotakis does not have a blank check on Monday. We call on every citizen, despite the fatigue of two elections, to go to the polls, not to take their vote out of the account of democracy. Because the vote that is removed from the ballot box of the Republic is automatically added to the ballot box of the New Democracy. And despite whatever differences and reservations they may have with us, we call on them to stand firmly behind democracy, their tomorrow, their lives. So let us also convince those who did not vote in May to vote in June. Not only those who voted, not to think about abstaining, but to convince even those who did not vote to come to the polls now.
