We have insisted very much, as you will have seen, in this election, that there should be a confrontation of programs, a confrontation of strategies, concepts, ideas, and visions, so that citizens can compare, judge soberly, and with knowledge of the objective differences between the different alternative plans. On the contrary, our political opponent, New Democracy, has once again designed and implemented a toxic strategy, investing in fake news, constantly diverting public debate from the real issues at stake, and not even hesitating to throw sensitive national issues, such as Thrace and the minority, into the electoral arena. Armed with their audacity, lies, and the NIS, which they turned into a tool for serving party and personal interests, they did not even hesitate to take the country back, way back, to the years and the paths of the Schism. "National exception," they said, is SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. Its MPs and voters are "bequeathers." Half of them are "nationalists," and the other half of Greeks are "of reduced national consciousness." They evoked memories of the darkest years of the Schism. As if this is not New Democracy, but the ERE of the 1950s. As if we were in the period of the National Schism.
