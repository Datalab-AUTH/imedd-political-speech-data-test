Finally, it proposes a strong, modern, and effective state with meritocracy and accountability, which will not be a party or family spoils but will be a tool for development and service to citizens. Not the state that collapsed in Tempe three months ago and put ministers on the TV channels telling obscene lies. No, we will not forget this crime! The 57 souls are asking for justice. And we will fight. This is our promise to the parents of the unfortunate children, but also to the young men and women of our country who must never again experience such a tragedy. We will fight for justice and a state that stands by the citizen. Not an enemy of the citizen. Not a state dangerous to the citizen.
