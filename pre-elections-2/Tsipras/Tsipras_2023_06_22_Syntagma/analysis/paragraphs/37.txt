But they have learned the lesson they deserved, a lesson of national responsibility, patriotism, and democratic sensitivity from SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance. Mr. Mitsotakis wanted to vilify us and our minority MPs, and he finally vilified his own minority candidate. He made him a scapegoat, as is his wont. And it went downhill to the point of sending Mrs. Bakoyianni to Thrace, not to unite but to divide. Not to reassure but to threaten. And to come out in front of the cameras with the audacity to threaten and terrorize poor and frightened people: "If you don't vote the right way this time, you're going to have four hard years." That was her message. And that message was not a message for the minority. It was and is a message that they wanted to go to every citizen, every home, every social group, every citizen who would think of standing up to their party and family power.
