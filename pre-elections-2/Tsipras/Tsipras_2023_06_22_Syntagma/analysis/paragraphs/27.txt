Of the first 600 million euros of loans from the Recovery Fund, not a single euro was given to small and medium-sized enterprises for healthy entrepreneurship. It all went to ten strong, big businesses that have access to lending, so they can borrow at a cheaper rate. This is not the future of sustainable and fair development in the country. Instead, it is closing the door on the logic that investment is about taking over operating businesses and also privatization. These are not strategic investments that leave a productive footprint.
