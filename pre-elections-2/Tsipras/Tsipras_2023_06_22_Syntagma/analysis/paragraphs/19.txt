This is what we did last week during the tragic shipwreck in Pylos, the deadliest shipwreck in the history of our country. Wherever we were told, we remembered what we were told: "Don't speak, don't ask, don't breathe!" Why? Because they were not rich, they were oppressed. Because they were not Greeks, they were not even tourists, they were refugees. That's what they told us last week: "Don't talk, don't ask, don't breathe." And we answered them: We have an obligation towards our values and our culture to both speak and ask questions because we serve these values. We served them when we made this country synonymous with humanity when it faced the biggest refugee crisis Europe has faced since World War II. We are proud of that. We are proud to be here to defend values. We made this country synonymous with humanity, and we will not allow some people today to make it synonymous with barbarism. Greece will remain synonymous with humanity.
