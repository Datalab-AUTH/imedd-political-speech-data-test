Our political opponents are trying to hide these aspects of their plan and program from the electoral debate. They announce commitments that they will not implement while hiding others that they aim to implement. The real government program of New Democracy is the one that Mitsotakis submitted to Brussels as the Stability Program just two months ago. Therefore, this program, the true program of our opponents, does not include any of his election promises. Mr. Mitsotakis's election announcements are a fraud, a sham.
