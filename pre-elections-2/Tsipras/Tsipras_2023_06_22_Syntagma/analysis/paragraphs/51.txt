Because, citizens of Athens, you know well that the SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance did not happen by accident, nor by chance, nor by accident from 2012 onwards. The people's party, the great party of the Left, the pillar of the progressive party, the refuge and support of the underprivileged, the voice of those who have no voice in this place, was not made by accident! The SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance was, is, and will be a mature child of necessity, the spokesman of the hope of the popular strata, the main pillar of the progressive party in our country. Not a party of protest, nor a complement and willing partner in the plans of the Right, as PASOK has been since 2012, but a party of governance, a party that wants to bring the people to governance and power. And we will bring the people and the Progressive Party back into the governance of the country, to put our visions, our aspirations, our values into practice. We are and will be here, together, to defend every social group that is in the crosshairs of right-wing policies that breed barbarism, to give breath to democracy and space to resistance, alongside every citizen seeking justice, standing with the weapons of democracy, speech, and vote, with the rightness of our positions, ideas, and values. With these weapons, I invite you to fight the difficult battle on Sunday, and until the ballot box, in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every home, person by person, to reclaim every vote. With calculation and with a dream, we will fight this fight, the fight of our ideas, the fight of our values, the struggle of dignity, for a just society, for prosperity for all and for all. So let's go all the way to victory! Let's go forward for social justice, for prosperity for all! Let's go forward, and we will win! Goodbye, good strength, good fight!
