Because, yes, we stayed in Europe and we are the ones who defied the political cost and did our duty to society and our country. We have unburdened this country by washing the dirty laundry of the entire post-independence period. Sins that belonged to others were washed away by us! We took the country out of the memoranda, we regulated the public debt! We left 40 billion in the public coffers! Yes, we fought the battle with the Troika and the lenders, but we exploited every crack in the negotiation for the benefit of the public interest. We put 2.5 million uninsured people on the NHS. We raised the minimum wage! We reinstated the minimum wage. We brought back collective bargaining. We are proud of what we have achieved in the face of incredible difficulties. Yes, we stayed in Europe. But now it is time to become Europe. It is not enough that we have stayed, we have to become.
