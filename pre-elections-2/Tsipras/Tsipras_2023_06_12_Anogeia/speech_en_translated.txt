I would like to warmly thank you for welcoming me here in Anogia today. It is always a great honor and pleasure for me to be in your village. It is no coincidence that I chose to come to Crete and that this is the first place where I will be speaking. These places here on Psiloritis give you strength, they are full of energy, and they have proud people. We, as you say, revived centrists, are here to fight the battle. Why? You know very well, and I know very well. As in life, so in politics, you are allowed to fall, but you must get up. To get up, to fight the fight.

And I want to tell you something that I believe is a commitment and a promise, but also something that I deeply believe, here in Anogia, this wonderful and proud place. The SYRIZA progressive alliance was and is a force that shocked many people 10 or 11 years ago when it made a great leap from 4% to 28% and then to 36%. Why did SYRIZA make that leap? Was it a coincidence? No, it wasn't a coincidence or something accidental. It expressed hopes and social needs. It was and is a mature child of the needs of society. It expressed what was once genuinely expressed by what we call the Democratic Party in this country, that is, the hopes of underprivileged Greeks, society, grassroots social strata, and people who do not seek comfort but live by their toil, their own creation, and want justice.

That is why SYRIZA was not a flare that shone one year and then fizzled out in the next election. It challenged and won the governance of the country under the most difficult circumstances and fought honestly not against the local establishment, but against the European establishment at the time. Let us not forget that. And he had the misfortune to govern, taking over a country that was bankrupt. By whom? From those who ruled the country for 40 years and left it bankrupt. They left in 2009, our political opponents, a 15% deficit and in 2015 empty funds so we couldn't pay pensions.

And when we took on this great difficulty, I remember our political opponents said, "Hey Geroun, hey, hey, hey!" They were with the foreigners in this battle that we were fighting. We fought this battle with honesty, dignity, and a view to honoring the popular mandate we received, the dignity of the hard-working people we represent, and the need and thirst of Greek society for justice. We have gone to extremes, yes, but we are proud. We are proud because when we saw the difficulties, we did not run away. We performed our patriotic duty by making the right and difficult decisions to keep society, the country, and the economy standing. We are proud that we managed to keep the country in Europe. At the same time, however, we must also keep society standing so that it does not get flattened.

And the most difficult things came later. When we were forced to reach a challenging agreement, we managed to push it through, even when nobody believed we could. We took advantage of every opportunity that arose during this tough negotiation, where we fought for our cause, representing Greek society and the vast majority of its people. We achieved a lot, but we also made mistakes and wronged many. Despite having the Troika looming over us and the obligation to collect 40 billion in public funds that we found empty, we still managed to give as much space as possible to the weak and to society. The memoranda paved the way, and we are proud of it.

Xanthos and Polakis, who were health ministers at the time, are here today. We brought in two and a half million uninsured with the memoranda. Two and a half million uninsured people are back on health cover because, at the time, we seemed to have forgotten them quickly and they were out of health cover. They were paying EUR 5 in outpatient clinics and hospitals, but we managed to get them back on their feet in the public hospitals to have positive balance sheets.

At the same time, we tried our best to create the conditions for growth to return to the country. Growth did come to the country, and we regulated the public debt. We collected this money in the public coffers and did not put it in our pockets. We left it for the next generation. We are the only government in the country that left the coffers full for the next generation, and they cannot say that they received chaos. As soon as we got out of the memoranda, we brought back collective bargaining, raised the minimum wage, abolished the racist sub-minimum wage, and strengthened the labor inspectorate so that workers would have a bulwark against employer arbitrariness.

We have supported those who are working on the thirteenth pension.

We have reduced VAT on catering and energy. During these difficult four years of our government, the Public Electricity Company and all other energy companies have not increased the electricity bill by even €1.

And of course, I admit that the salaries and pensions were not the best possible. However, in '19, wages and pensions provided 40% more purchasing power. You could buy 40% more goods at the supermarket with the same salary than you can today. According to ELSTAT figures, the purchasing power of Greeks with an income of up to €700 has fallen by 40%. Despite the terrible budgetary difficulties, inequalities have been reduced. What happened next? The election controversy of '19 occurred, we lost the election, and they promised to raise wages, create more jobs, and move the country forward.

The truth is that these four years that have passed, the comparison between our government and that of Mr Mitsotakis is an unequal comparison because we had the obligation to raise 40 billion, and Mr Mitsotakis, because of the pandemic, had the freedom to spend 60 billion. You understand that if we had the freedom to spend 60 billion instead of the obligation to raise 40, today our country would be very different. There would be public hospitals, strong ones where one could go with dignity.

We would have increased pensions and strengthened the welfare state.

We would not have 30% of substitute teachers in schools. Our universities would be stronger with more spending to have dormitories and professors, not police officers patrolling the campuses. Teachers are what our children need, not hiring cops.

And of course, I want to dwell a little bit on the issue of public health. Despite the conditions of crisis and great difficulty, we not only got the hospitals back on their feet and put two and a half million uninsured people on their feet, but we also recruited 300 people in the ambulance service with memoranda. In addition to the 300, there were those who were hired during our time in the ambulance service. For four years now, the New Democracy government has not made a single recruitment in the ambulance service. We have had 560 rescuers leave, but not a single recruitment. Why? Did Mr Mitsotakis have the Troika over his head? Did he have memoranda? Did he have budgetary constraints? He had no money when he had 60 billion to spend? Precisely because of the pandemic, that money enabled him to spend it to strengthen public health. No. It is not that he had no money, it is that he had no political will, he had no plan to strengthen the NHS, and so we see where that political choice leads.

In the past few days, three of our fellow citizens have lost their lives: a 63-year-old woman in Kos who was in the back of a farm car, a 19-year-old pregnant woman in Nea Makri in Athens, and another 63-year-old woman in Chalkidiki because the ambulance did not arrive in time to pick them up. The reason for the delay is that although we have acquired 143 new ambulances, there are no staff to operate them. I ask you, given the talk about program costs, how much did it cost to hire 600-700 paramedics for the ambulance service over the past four years? Would the budget have been exceeded? The university police department hired 1000, so why couldn't the EMS hire 700? Even if it is costly, I wonder what the true value and cost of human life, dignity, and the ability to prevent people from dying like dogs in the back of a pickup truck because there are no rescuers or ambulances.

These are the big and crucial issues that we have to discuss in view of the June 25th election. What kind of healthcare will we have? What will happen to accuracy? How can we prevent our children from going abroad? How can we become Europe, to put it bluntly? Because SYRIZA played a decisive role in keeping us in Europe, but the time has come for us to not only stay in Europe but also become Europe. We are currently one of the last per capita incomes in the whole European Union, along with Romania and Bulgaria, and we are now competing. So this is the crucial thing for us, for the next day. That is the crucial thing.

But I will return to the program. I want to return to the parentheses. Because I was explaining to you why SYRIZA came to stay, why SYRIZA was not a flash in the pan, because it came to serve, to represent social needs, to represent the underprivileged, and why SYRIZA has become and will remain, for this reason, the pillar, the strong force of the democratic space. The strength and pillar of the progressive party. It was, is, and will remain. As it was, is, and will remain a party of power. Neither a party of protest nor a party to complement the governments of our political opponents. Ask yourself why in 2012 Syriza managed to do this? Why did SYRIZA become the heart, the soul, the core of the democratic progressive party of the country? For the very simple reason: it claimed power in the name of the people for government. In other words, it became a party of power at a time when other progressive forces that used to be in the lead, and I am referring to Kinal, chose to become a party of power, to become a supplement to the right-wing government, making Mr. Samaras prime minister at the time. The history of the country did not begin in 2015. We have a memory of what happened before 2015 and what happened after 2015.

So we will never become a complementary force to our political opponents. We will be a party of power against New Democracy, against Mr. Mitsotakis. I remember our political opponents. We have very important ideological and political differences. But the country's political system needs two poles in order to be healthy and stable, and this is the moment for me to make my self-criticism. I criticize myself in relation to the strategic entrapment that we suffered in the last election. And yes, the parity of the vote was a vision of value for the left, worthy of decades of contention. We have no regrets about adhering to our value framework. Even though we were a ruling party and a government at the time, we did not act in a utilitarian way that would benefit the parties in power. We wanted to change the political system of the country and become like Europe, where large and stable European countries have a political system with less toxicity, with two important poles, left and right, but with cooperation on programmatic convergences. This is what we dreamed of and envisioned.

But the tango requires two people. The dance here in Crete, the pedozali, requires more. We were alone and dancing. While we were extending a hand of cooperation to other progressive forces on how to govern the country with a progressive program for the future, they were looking to cut off our hand and give us a one-way ticket, not Mr. Mitsotakis. As we struggled through this dance, we were focused on the country's future, while they were focused on growing their own field. Therefore, simple proportional representation has suffered a strategic defeat. Instead of acting as a lever of pressure to promote progressive developments, simple proportional representation led to the fragmentation of progressive forces, especially SYRIZA, because people voted more loosely. They did not vote based on the fact that the government would be in power the next day, but the right managed to regain their share. Today, we find ourselves with a strategic defeat of proportional representation and a defeat of our strategy, to be honest, for proportional representation.

But, friends, on June 25th we have an election ahead of us, not with simple proportional representation, but with enhanced proportional representation. Let each and every one of us take responsibility for this. We take ours. And let other progressive forces that have buried simple proportional representation take theirs too. For example, the KKE fought for 60-70 years for simple proportional representation. When we brought it in, they said, "You are all the same, I don't care." What did KINAL do? It went one-on-one with Syriza. During the election campaign, it said that we don't want either Tsipras or Mitsotakis, but if some people are missing, we will leave some MPs. We will not leave the country ungoverned. Who benefited from this strategy? Mitsotakis, who was ahead in the polls. It left open, that is, we will not leave the country ungoverned, cooperation with the right. But when the election result came in, they changed their tune. If Mitsotakis had 149, we're not going. What happened and they changed the trope? Mitsotakis' need changed. Mitsotakis' need now is to blackmail his voters to go to the polls, to vote for him. He says if I don't have 151, we'll go to a third election. So if I were Mitsotakis, and I didn't have Androulakis, I would have to invent him to help me. The difference between us and the KKE and KINAL is what I told you before. We are and will remain a party of power. We have not been and will not be a complement to our political opponents, nor a party of protest, no matter what happens in this ballot box. We are the party that will stand on its own feet to strengthen the prospect of a resurgence, of a progressive party in power. We will return to power, to governance, to represent the interests of the vast majority of Greek society.

You will say to me, "Okay, what will happen in this election?" So I say to you, in this election, we are not flying in the clouds. It is very difficult to completely reverse the correlations. However, Mitsotakis is the first to say, and I am not the first to say it, that the ballot box will be empty on June 25th, and it will be full on June 25th. The criterion for voting is different now. First of all, because it is an election with enhanced proportional representation. What does this mean? Either one will get out or the other. Either New Democracy's program will be implemented if New Democracy wins and gets 50 bonus seats, or Syriza's program will be implemented if Syriza wins and gets 50 bonus seats. In any case, it is crucial, not only for society but also for democracy itself, not to have an uncontrollable and all-powerful, arrogant right-wing that will come to flatten social rights without an opponent on the 26th of this month.

So that's why we say, objectively now, with the enhanced proportional representation elections, every vote of a progressive citizen who doesn't want it, because he knows that it will be uncontrollable and ruthless if the new democracy is all-powerful. Every progressive citizen's vote that goes to any other ballot box, except the Syriza ballot box, objectively favors the plan of Mr. Mitsotakis and the New Democracy. Not having an opponent the next day so that he can look him in the eye. So we have a goal, to have a victorious result, to reverse the correlation, but in any case, we have a goal the next day to be strong against those policies that plunder the interests of Greek society, of the social majority. And I know that there will be many of our fellow citizens, voters of the New Democracy, who will agree with this proposal. Because they know that it is healthy for democracy, stability for the country, a political system with strong pillars and not a political system in which the one who governs is uncontrollable.

Unfortunately, we have seen in the last four years that the government was very arrogant. We saw that the rule of law was not respected, with surveillance.

We noticed that pluralism was not respected in the 108-type briefing, ranking eighteenth in the world.

So we have seen and we see now that this arrogant behavior is dangerous. For example, the unacceptable and nationally damaging behavior that we are seeing these days with these games that are being played with such a sensitive national issue, with the Muslim minority in Thrace, which for 45 years now, for as long as I can remember, has been voting according to its own criteria. No party has ever come out and said, "These MPs voted because they made a deal with Erdogan." They voted for a deal with Erdogan. When your compatriot, Dora Bakoyannis, stood in the elections, she got 2% nationwide, but in Rodopi she got 18 and in Iasmos she got 70. What had happened then? Had she made a deal with Erdogan? Had anyone come out and said anything like that? But today the unscrupulous, because this part of the electoral map has not been painted blue, come out and say without shame that a party that ruled the country with dignity, with national pride, are traitors. So where do they go from here? Where will they go? Mrs. Bakoyannis came out, went and found the minority, and said to them, "You know what? If you don't vote for us, you will have a hard time." And look, this is not just a message to the Muslim minority. This is a message to every social class, to every citizen. She said it in front of the cameras so that this message could go to every home, that if there are social groups, citizens who have a different opinion, a different view, a different will than that of our own government, party, or family, you will have a hard time. Be careful.

So, we say that democracy has always been strong in our country, and it will remain strong. Both SYRIZA and I will fight so that no one feels fear and no social group is left alone. Because, my friends, do you know what? We have managed very big crises. We have managed them not only with honesty but also with patriotic responsibility. It is a great hypocrisy that we see before us. When I was with the Admiral, the Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we had Barbaros violating our sovereign rights. We were going to confront Barbaros, like they did with the Oruce Rays that went up and down all over the Aegean. They said it was being taken by the waves and the wind, making noise, and not violating our sovereign rights. We had sent the frigate Nikiforos Fokas, and it prevented Barbaros from conducting surveys. So they will not come out to talk about patriotism. Just as we do not speak of Greeks with diminished patriotism, we will not tolerate anyone questioning our patriotism because we have fulfilled our patriotic duty to the fullest.

And we fulfilled our patriotic duty completely, when some of us decided to invest in our country. Because I don't want to forget why we were called traitors in 2018-19. Whatever we traded Macedonia for pensions, why? Because we decided to remove this country on our northern border from the influence of Turkey, so that it would not become another Libya and Greek F16s could fly over its airspace. And then we were called traitors, and what did those who called us traitors do 4 years later? They honored and respected the agreement, and Zaev sent a congratulatory telegram to Mitsotakis because he was fighting for the rights of North Macedonia. So hypocrisy in political matters is common, but hypocrisy in national matters is harmful.

And whatever political party we belong to, left, center, or right, we must safeguard the interests of the country and not play around with these issues. This is a crucial issue. I would, therefore, like to conclude by saying, what is at stake in the next day is not parties or people, but our lives. Four years, with which program will the country be governed? Will it be governed with a program that puts emphasis on the need to strengthen the national health system? Or a program that puts emphasis on the need to fight the need for accuracy?

Should we stop giving subsidies? They gave 22.10 billion to the energy cartels, the supermarket cartels, and the refineries, but keep VAT high. Or is it a program that will further devalue public healthcare and continue this plundering of income through the targeted aid of the powerful and the taxing of the many?

These are the two critical issues, and a third critical issue is auctions. There are expected to be 700,000 foreclosures because everyone has gotten mortgages from the banks. These include 700,000 first homes, commercial housing, and farmland. The funds have no choice; if they don't go to a framework of regulation, auctions will happen.

So I say, the crucial thing is the program and especially these three crucial issues: healthcare, accuracy, and auctions. As far as accuracy is concerned, let me say two things. Syriza's program says that VAT and excise duty must be reduced. The New Democracy program says that VAT and excise duty should not be reduced, and at the same time, Mitsotakis tells us that he has not introduced a single tax. However, when the cost in the household basket doubles, but the VAT rate remains constant, it does not have to go up to be taxed. When the household basket costs 50€, but it has reached 100€ and the tax rate remains constant, the VAT doubles the collection from the state, so you double the tax you pay. The same goes for petrol. When you put petrol at 50€ and now you put it at 100€ and the tax stays the same, you pay double the tax. That is what has happened in the last year and a half in our country. 6 billion euros in extra taxes paid by Greeks to the public coffers through indirect taxation.

Why? To provide targeted subsidies that do not end up in the pockets of Greek citizens. Instead, they go to energy cartels to maintain high prices, as well as to supply chain cartels in supermarkets and refineries. Let's call a spade a spade. It's not possible to have petrol in Cyprus at 1.20 and in Crete, Greece at 1.80. How is this possible? In Athens, it's 1.90, and in Crete, it's even more expensive at 1.80.

If VAT is reduced on basic consumer goods, prices will fall. If excise duty is reduced to the lowest permissible levels in the European Union, prices will fall. If we abolish the obligation for farmers and stockbreeders to pay excise duty, as we do on 1000 litres, they will have a breathing space of more than €500. Will this save them? No, but it will be a breather. And the big question is if they stay high on VAT and excise duty and run out of allowances, what happens the next day? Because these passes that Mr Mitsotakis has been giving for the last year and a half, the European Commission itself has come out and said by the end of the year, no more, no more.

These are the critical issues: whether income redistribution will continue through taxation or high VAT, and whether there will be greater redistribution of property with the 700,000 expected auctions in the next period.

Whether to strengthen public health and public education or to strengthen colleges in education and private hospitals in healthcare.

These are the critical questions that we will honestly ask. We will tell our truth to the Greek people and let them decide. We will, of course, accept their verdict, whatever it is. But I give you a commitment today, here on Psiloritis, that whatever the verdict, we will stand our ground and fight. We will be here to support the weak, the middle class, and the hope of justice in our country. Sooner or later, we will bring back the progressive party at the helm of the country and Crete to lead the struggle again. The progressive party and SYRIZA will be at the helm of the country. Whatever happens, we will be here to fight and we will succeed. Thank you very much!
