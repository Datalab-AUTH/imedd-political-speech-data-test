In the past few days, three of our fellow citizens have lost their lives: a 63-year-old woman in Kos who was in the back of a farm car, a 19-year-old pregnant woman in Nea Makri in Athens, and another 63-year-old woman in Chalkidiki because the ambulance did not arrive in time to pick them up. The reason for the delay is that although we have acquired 143 new ambulances, there are no staff to operate them. I ask you, given the talk about program costs, how much did it cost to hire 600-700 paramedics for the ambulance service over the past four years? Would the budget have been exceeded? The university police department hired 1000, so why couldn't the EMS hire 700? Even if it is costly, I wonder what the true value and cost of human life, dignity, and the ability to prevent people from dying like dogs in the back of a pickup truck because there are no rescuers or ambulances.
