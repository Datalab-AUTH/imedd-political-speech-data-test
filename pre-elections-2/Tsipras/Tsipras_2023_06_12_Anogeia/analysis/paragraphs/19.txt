But the tango requires two people. The dance here in Crete, the pedozali, requires more. We were alone and dancing. While we were extending a hand of cooperation to other progressive forces on how to govern the country with a progressive program for the future, they were looking to cut off our hand and give us a one-way ticket, not Mr. Mitsotakis. As we struggled through this dance, we were focused on the country's future, while they were focused on growing their own field. Therefore, simple proportional representation has suffered a strategic defeat. Instead of acting as a lever of pressure to promote progressive developments, simple proportional representation led to the fragmentation of progressive forces, especially SYRIZA, because people voted more loosely. They did not vote based on the fact that the government would be in power the next day, but the right managed to regain their share. Today, we find ourselves with a strategic defeat of proportional representation and a defeat of our strategy, to be honest, for proportional representation.
