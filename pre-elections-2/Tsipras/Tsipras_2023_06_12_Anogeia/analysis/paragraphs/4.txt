And when we took on this great difficulty, I remember our political opponents said, "Hey Geroun, hey, hey, hey!" They were with the foreigners in this battle that we were fighting. We fought this battle with honesty, dignity, and a view to honoring the popular mandate we received, the dignity of the hard-working people we represent, and the need and thirst of Greek society for justice. We have gone to extremes, yes, but we are proud. We are proud because when we saw the difficulties, we did not run away. We performed our patriotic duty by making the right and difficult decisions to keep society, the country, and the economy standing. We are proud that we managed to keep the country in Europe. At the same time, however, we must also keep society standing so that it does not get flattened.
