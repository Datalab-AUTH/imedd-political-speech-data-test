That is why SYRIZA was not a flare that shone one year and then fizzled out in the next election. It challenged and won the governance of the country under the most difficult circumstances and fought honestly not against the local establishment, but against the European establishment at the time. Let us not forget that. And he had the misfortune to govern, taking over a country that was bankrupt. By whom? From those who ruled the country for 40 years and left it bankrupt. They left in 2009, our political opponents, a 15% deficit and in 2015 empty funds so we couldn't pay pensions.
