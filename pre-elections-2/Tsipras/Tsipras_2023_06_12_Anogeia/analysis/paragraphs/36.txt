These are the critical questions that we will honestly ask. We will tell our truth to the Greek people and let them decide. We will, of course, accept their verdict, whatever it is. But I give you a commitment today, here on Psiloritis, that whatever the verdict, we will stand our ground and fight. We will be here to support the weak, the middle class, and the hope of justice in our country. Sooner or later, we will bring back the progressive party at the helm of the country and Crete to lead the struggle again. The progressive party and SYRIZA will be at the helm of the country. Whatever happens, we will be here to fight and we will succeed. Thank you very much!
