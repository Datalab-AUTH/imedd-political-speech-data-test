You will say to me, "Okay, what will happen in this election?" So I say to you, in this election, we are not flying in the clouds. It is very difficult to completely reverse the correlations. However, Mitsotakis is the first to say, and I am not the first to say it, that the ballot box will be empty on June 25th, and it will be full on June 25th. The criterion for voting is different now. First of all, because it is an election with enhanced proportional representation. What does this mean? Either one will get out or the other. Either New Democracy's program will be implemented if New Democracy wins and gets 50 bonus seats, or Syriza's program will be implemented if Syriza wins and gets 50 bonus seats. In any case, it is crucial, not only for society but also for democracy itself, not to have an uncontrollable and all-powerful, arrogant right-wing that will come to flatten social rights without an opponent on the 26th of this month.
