And we fulfilled our patriotic duty completely, when some of us decided to invest in our country. Because I don't want to forget why we were called traitors in 2018-19. Whatever we traded Macedonia for pensions, why? Because we decided to remove this country on our northern border from the influence of Turkey, so that it would not become another Libya and Greek F16s could fly over its airspace. And then we were called traitors, and what did those who called us traitors do 4 years later? They honored and respected the agreement, and Zaev sent a congratulatory telegram to Mitsotakis because he was fighting for the rights of North Macedonia. So hypocrisy in political matters is common, but hypocrisy in national matters is harmful.
