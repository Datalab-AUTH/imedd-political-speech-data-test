Xanthos and Polakis, who were health ministers at the time, are here today. We brought in two and a half million uninsured with the memoranda. Two and a half million uninsured people are back on health cover because, at the time, we seemed to have forgotten them quickly and they were out of health cover. They were paying EUR 5 in outpatient clinics and hospitals, but we managed to get them back on their feet in the public hospitals to have positive balance sheets.
