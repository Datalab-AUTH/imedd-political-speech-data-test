I would like to warmly thank you for welcoming me here in Anogia today. It is always a great honor and pleasure for me to be in your village. It is no coincidence that I chose to come to Crete and that this is the first place where I will be speaking. These places here on Psiloritis give you strength, they are full of energy, and they have proud people. We, as you say, revived centrists, are here to fight the battle. Why? You know very well, and I know very well. As in life, so in politics, you are allowed to fall, but you must get up. To get up, to fight the fight.
