So I say, the crucial thing is the program and especially these three crucial issues: healthcare, accuracy, and auctions. As far as accuracy is concerned, let me say two things. Syriza's program says that VAT and excise duty must be reduced. The New Democracy program says that VAT and excise duty should not be reduced, and at the same time, Mitsotakis tells us that he has not introduced a single tax. However, when the cost in the household basket doubles, but the VAT rate remains constant, it does not have to go up to be taxed. When the household basket costs 50€, but it has reached 100€ and the tax rate remains constant, the VAT doubles the collection from the state, so you double the tax you pay. The same goes for petrol. When you put petrol at 50€ and now you put it at 100€ and the tax stays the same, you pay double the tax. That is what has happened in the last year and a half in our country. 6 billion euros in extra taxes paid by Greeks to the public coffers through indirect taxation.
