But I will return to the program. I want to return to the parentheses. Because I was explaining to you why SYRIZA came to stay, why SYRIZA was not a flash in the pan, because it came to serve, to represent social needs, to represent the underprivileged, and why SYRIZA has become and will remain, for this reason, the pillar, the strong force of the democratic space. The strength and pillar of the progressive party. It was, is, and will remain. As it was, is, and will remain a party of power. Neither a party of protest nor a party to complement the governments of our political opponents. Ask yourself why in 2012 Syriza managed to do this? Why did SYRIZA become the heart, the soul, the core of the democratic progressive party of the country? For the very simple reason: it claimed power in the name of the people for government. In other words, it became a party of power at a time when other progressive forces that used to be in the lead, and I am referring to Kinal, chose to become a party of power, to become a supplement to the right-wing government, making Mr. Samaras prime minister at the time. The history of the country did not begin in 2015. We have a memory of what happened before 2015 and what happened after 2015.
