And the most difficult things came later. When we were forced to reach a challenging agreement, we managed to push it through, even when nobody believed we could. We took advantage of every opportunity that arose during this tough negotiation, where we fought for our cause, representing Greek society and the vast majority of its people. We achieved a lot, but we also made mistakes and wronged many. Despite having the Troika looming over us and the obligation to collect 40 billion in public funds that we found empty, we still managed to give as much space as possible to the weak and to society. The memoranda paved the way, and we are proud of it.
