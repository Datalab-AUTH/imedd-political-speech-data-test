So that's why we say, objectively now, with the enhanced proportional representation elections, every vote of a progressive citizen who doesn't want it, because he knows that it will be uncontrollable and ruthless if the new democracy is all-powerful. Every progressive citizen's vote that goes to any other ballot box, except the Syriza ballot box, objectively favors the plan of Mr. Mitsotakis and the New Democracy. Not having an opponent the next day so that he can look him in the eye. So we have a goal, to have a victorious result, to reverse the correlation, but in any case, we have a goal the next day to be strong against those policies that plunder the interests of Greek society, of the social majority. And I know that there will be many of our fellow citizens, voters of the New Democracy, who will agree with this proposal. Because they know that it is healthy for democracy, stability for the country, a political system with strong pillars and not a political system in which the one who governs is uncontrollable.
