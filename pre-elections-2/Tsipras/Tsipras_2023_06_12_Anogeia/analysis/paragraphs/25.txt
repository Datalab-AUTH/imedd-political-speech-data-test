So we have seen and we see now that this arrogant behavior is dangerous. For example, the unacceptable and nationally damaging behavior that we are seeing these days with these games that are being played with such a sensitive national issue, with the Muslim minority in Thrace, which for 45 years now, for as long as I can remember, has been voting according to its own criteria. No party has ever come out and said, "These MPs voted because they made a deal with Erdogan." They voted for a deal with Erdogan. When your compatriot, Dora Bakoyannis, stood in the elections, she got 2% nationwide, but in Rodopi she got 18 and in Iasmos she got 70. What had happened then? Had she made a deal with Erdogan? Had anyone come out and said anything like that? But today the unscrupulous, because this part of the electoral map has not been painted blue, come out and say without shame that a party that ruled the country with dignity, with national pride, are traitors. So where do they go from here? Where will they go? Mrs. Bakoyannis came out, went and found the minority, and said to them, "You know what? If you don't vote for us, you will have a hard time." And look, this is not just a message to the Muslim minority. This is a message to every social class, to every citizen. She said it in front of the cameras so that this message could go to every home, that if there are social groups, citizens who have a different opinion, a different view, a different will than that of our own government, party, or family, you will have a hard time. Be careful.
