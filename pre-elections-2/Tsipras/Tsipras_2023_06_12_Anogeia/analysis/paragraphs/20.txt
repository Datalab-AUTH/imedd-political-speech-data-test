But, friends, on June 25th we have an election ahead of us, not with simple proportional representation, but with enhanced proportional representation. Let each and every one of us take responsibility for this. We take ours. And let other progressive forces that have buried simple proportional representation take theirs too. For example, the KKE fought for 60-70 years for simple proportional representation. When we brought it in, they said, "You are all the same, I don't care." What did KINAL do? It went one-on-one with Syriza. During the election campaign, it said that we don't want either Tsipras or Mitsotakis, but if some people are missing, we will leave some MPs. We will not leave the country ungoverned. Who benefited from this strategy? Mitsotakis, who was ahead in the polls. It left open, that is, we will not leave the country ungoverned, cooperation with the right. But when the election result came in, they changed their tune. If Mitsotakis had 149, we're not going. What happened and they changed the trope? Mitsotakis' need changed. Mitsotakis' need now is to blackmail his voters to go to the polls, to vote for him. He says if I don't have 151, we'll go to a third election. So if I were Mitsotakis, and I didn't have Androulakis, I would have to invent him to help me. The difference between us and the KKE and KINAL is what I told you before. We are and will remain a party of power. We have not been and will not be a complement to our political opponents, nor a party of protest, no matter what happens in this ballot box. We are the party that will stand on its own feet to strengthen the prospect of a resurgence, of a progressive party in power. We will return to power, to governance, to represent the interests of the vast majority of Greek society.
