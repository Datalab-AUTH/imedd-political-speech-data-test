Why? To provide targeted subsidies that do not end up in the pockets of Greek citizens. Instead, they go to energy cartels to maintain high prices, as well as to supply chain cartels in supermarkets and refineries. Let's call a spade a spade. It's not possible to have petrol in Cyprus at 1.20 and in Crete, Greece at 1.80. How is this possible? In Athens, it's 1.90, and in Crete, it's even more expensive at 1.80.
