So we will never become a complementary force to our political opponents. We will be a party of power against New Democracy, against Mr. Mitsotakis. I remember our political opponents. We have very important ideological and political differences. But the country's political system needs two poles in order to be healthy and stable, and this is the moment for me to make my self-criticism. I criticize myself in relation to the strategic entrapment that we suffered in the last election. And yes, the parity of the vote was a vision of value for the left, worthy of decades of contention. We have no regrets about adhering to our value framework. Even though we were a ruling party and a government at the time, we did not act in a utilitarian way that would benefit the parties in power. We wanted to change the political system of the country and become like Europe, where large and stable European countries have a political system with less toxicity, with two important poles, left and right, but with cooperation on programmatic convergences. This is what we dreamed of and envisioned.
