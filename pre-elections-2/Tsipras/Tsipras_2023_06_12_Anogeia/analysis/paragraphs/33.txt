If VAT is reduced on basic consumer goods, prices will fall. If excise duty is reduced to the lowest permissible levels in the European Union, prices will fall. If we abolish the obligation for farmers and stockbreeders to pay excise duty, as we do on 1000 litres, they will have a breathing space of more than â‚¬500. Will this save them? No, but it will be a breather. And the big question is if they stay high on VAT and excise duty and run out of allowances, what happens the next day? Because these passes that Mr Mitsotakis has been giving for the last year and a half, the European Commission itself has come out and said by the end of the year, no more, no more.
