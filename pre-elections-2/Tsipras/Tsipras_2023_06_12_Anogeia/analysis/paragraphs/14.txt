And of course, I want to dwell a little bit on the issue of public health. Despite the conditions of crisis and great difficulty, we not only got the hospitals back on their feet and put two and a half million uninsured people on their feet, but we also recruited 300 people in the ambulance service with memoranda. In addition to the 300, there were those who were hired during our time in the ambulance service. For four years now, the New Democracy government has not made a single recruitment in the ambulance service. We have had 560 rescuers leave, but not a single recruitment. Why? Did Mr Mitsotakis have the Troika over his head? Did he have memoranda? Did he have budgetary constraints? He had no money when he had 60 billion to spend? Precisely because of the pandemic, that money enabled him to spend it to strengthen public health. No. It is not that he had no money, it is that he had no political will, he had no plan to strengthen the NHS, and so we see where that political choice leads.
