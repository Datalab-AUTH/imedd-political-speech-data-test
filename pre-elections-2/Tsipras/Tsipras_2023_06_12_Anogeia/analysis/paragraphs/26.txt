So, we say that democracy has always been strong in our country, and it will remain strong. Both SYRIZA and I will fight so that no one feels fear and no social group is left alone. Because, my friends, do you know what? We have managed very big crises. We have managed them not only with honesty but also with patriotic responsibility. It is a great hypocrisy that we see before us. When I was with the Admiral, the Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we had Barbaros violating our sovereign rights. We were going to confront Barbaros, like they did with the Oruce Rays that went up and down all over the Aegean. They said it was being taken by the waves and the wind, making noise, and not violating our sovereign rights. We had sent the frigate Nikiforos Fokas, and it prevented Barbaros from conducting surveys. So they will not come out to talk about patriotism. Just as we do not speak of Greeks with diminished patriotism, we will not tolerate anyone questioning our patriotism because we have fulfilled our patriotic duty to the fullest.
