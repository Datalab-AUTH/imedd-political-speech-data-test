The truth is that these four years that have passed, the comparison between our government and that of Mr Mitsotakis is an unequal comparison because we had the obligation to raise 40 billion, and Mr Mitsotakis, because of the pandemic, had the freedom to spend 60 billion. You understand that if we had the freedom to spend 60 billion instead of the obligation to raise 40, today our country would be very different. There would be public hospitals, strong ones where one could go with dignity.
