And I want to tell you something that I believe is a commitment and a promise, but also something that I deeply believe, here in Anogia, this wonderful and proud place. The SYRIZA progressive alliance was and is a force that shocked many people 10 or 11 years ago when it made a great leap from 4% to 28% and then to 36%. Why did SYRIZA make that leap? Was it a coincidence? No, it wasn't a coincidence or something accidental. It expressed hopes and social needs. It was and is a mature child of the needs of society. It expressed what was once genuinely expressed by what we call the Democratic Party in this country, that is, the hopes of underprivileged Greeks, society, grassroots social strata, and people who do not seek comfort but live by their toil, their own creation, and want justice.
