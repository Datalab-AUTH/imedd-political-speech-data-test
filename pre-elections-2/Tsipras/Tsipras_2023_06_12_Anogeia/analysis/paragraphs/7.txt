At the same time, we tried our best to create the conditions for growth to return to the country. Growth did come to the country, and we regulated the public debt. We collected this money in the public coffers and did not put it in our pockets. We left it for the next generation. We are the only government in the country that left the coffers full for the next generation, and they cannot say that they received chaos. As soon as we got out of the memoranda, we brought back collective bargaining, raised the minimum wage, abolished the racist sub-minimum wage, and strengthened the labor inspectorate so that workers would have a bulwark against employer arbitrariness.
