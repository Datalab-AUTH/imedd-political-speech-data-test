And I want to ask myself and imagine what would happen if SYRIZA had done something similar. If SYRIZA had presented a program and made promises to the Greek people, but had actually presented different things to Europe for the next three years. And if their central minister had come out and admitted it on the central news bulletins, what would people be saying about SYRIZA now? What would they be saying about their uninspired alleged program? But today is Wednesday and tomorrow is Thursday for the system of power that governs us. We will tell the Greek people the truth, with all the strength of our souls, before they go to the ballot box. They need to know what is coming and what the two opposing and contrasting plans are. That is what we are doing today, and that is what we will do until Sunday.
