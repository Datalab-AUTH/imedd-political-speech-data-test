For this society, for these people - the people of creation, the workers, the employed, the scientists, the young, the young people, those who live by their own labor and not by the labor of others - each and every one of us in the coming days must be in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every village, in every home to demand every vote. We must give perspective to Greek society and support every citizen who needs it. We must not let the hope of justice be lost and extinguished in this country, nor let the hope and prospect of prosperity for all, a just society and prosperity for all, be extinguished. We will fight this fight with calculation and with dreams. It is a struggle of dignity, ideas, values, and proposals that are realistic and feasible, so that our society can take a step forward. You can be sure: we will win this struggle. Lost struggles are struggles that are not won. I am here with you today to pledge that together we will win this fight. Together we will move forward from Monday into the big, difficult struggles that lie ahead of us. We serve values and will remain the main pillar of the progressive party of the country - a party of power, not a supplement to the right, not a party of protest. We will move forward together and we will win. Be well.
