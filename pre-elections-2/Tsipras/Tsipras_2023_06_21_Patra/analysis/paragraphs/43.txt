That is why we are responding: We will not leave anyone alone in the face of regime logic. We will fight on behalf of every social group that resists. We will fight for everyone to have a voice and rights. We will fight for democracy. Because democracy has always been strong in this country and will remain strong. That is why, addressing all democratic citizens, we say to them: a strong SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance next Sunday means not only a strong society, but also a strong, healthy democracy. That is why it is crucial for life and for democracy to change the correlations of the previous ballot. That is why the decisive strengthening of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is crucial.
