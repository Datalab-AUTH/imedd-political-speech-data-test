And that is why we call on all citizens to think about their vote this Sunday once and for all. Our great difference is our concern for human life. Human life, for us, is self-worth. We will never put human life on the scales of cost and benefit, under any circumstances, whatever the cost. That is why we did not shy away from calling a spade a spade in the tragic, fatal shipwreck in Pylos. We cannot tolerate our country, which became synonymous with humanity in our day, now becoming synonymous with barbarity. We have long since chosen sides in the dilemma of 'humanity or barbarism', and this choice highlights our differences in all our programmatic aspects. Some have told us, "Don't ask questions about the shipwreck because things are different now in society, and you will lose votes." We replied, "We want nothing more than to defend our values." We put our values above all else, and we will serve those values no matter what we are told.
