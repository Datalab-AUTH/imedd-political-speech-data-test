You will remember, by the way, that immediately after the May 21 elections, Mr Georgiades revealed to us what they want. He says they want 180 MPs so that they can change the Constitution on their own. Their plan is - and they say so openly - the abolition of Article 16 and private universities. He rushed to advocate this to Mr Mitsotakis, and Mr Androulakis of PASOK advocated for Mr Georgiades for the revision of the Constitution. He intends to assist, he says, in changing the Constitution and Article 16. Along with healthcare, they have apparently put education at the center of their sights. If Mr Mitsotakis does not have the 180 MPs, Mr Androulakis will assist them in changing Article 16 and constitutionalizing speculation in the articles of the Constitution.
