Because, citizens of Patras, you know it very well and experience it: the subsidies that Mr Mitsotakis gives, the so-called passes, do not go into the pockets of the citizens. They go directly to the energy, refining, and supermarket cartels to keep prices high, and that is the redistribution of income. And he tells us "I didn't raise taxes". How did he not raise taxes when, in the last year and a half, they've raised over 6 billion in government revenue from taxation, indirect taxation? He raised taxes by 6 billion! Because when the price in the household basket increases from EUR 50 to EUR 100, it is not necessary to increase the VAT rate to double taxation. It is doubled by keeping the VAT rate fixed. That is our plan for accuracy, for tackling accuracy. But our plan also provides for strong state intervention to support security, dignity, and the rights of wage earners.
