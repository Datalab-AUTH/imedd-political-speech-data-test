I thank you from the bottom of my heart because your presence here today is much more important, much more useful, much more decisive than any other presence at any other gathering here in Achaia. Today, you are giving a vote of confidence and proving who the pillar of progressive and democratic Achaia is. It is SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, and you will prove it at the ballot box on the coming Sunday. It is a question of social justice, social protection, and democracy so that there can be a strong society and a strong democracy in this country. Goodbye. Good luck! Thank you very much. Up to the last minute, up to the last second before the polls close, we will fight this fight. But we will be here, together, to continue to fight for Greece, for the progressive Party, for democracy. Goodbye!
