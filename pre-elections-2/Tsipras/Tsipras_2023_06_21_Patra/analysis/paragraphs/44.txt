We call on every democratic and progressive citizen, every reasonable person who understands what an uncontrolled regime can mean, to strengthen us with their vote next Sunday, despite any differences or reservations they may have towards SYRIZA. This is to prevent the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis from receiving a blank cheque, to prevent the political life of the country from being orbitalised, and to make room for resistance, for society, and for the needs of the many. Our message from Patras is that we are and will be here, alongside every citizen who seeks justice. We will not bend, compromise, or retreat. Citizens of Achaia, I want to repeat an old saying: "You are allowed to fall, you are required to get up." And we are already on our feet! We are armed with democracy, speech, voting, the rightness of our positions, our ideas, and values to fight the difficult battle on Sunday. We will fight this battle vote by vote, house by house. But we will also fight the battle together from Monday to make the democratic and progressive Party the government in the country, to stand by the weak, to give prospects and hope to the small and medium-sized, the unemployed, the young, and the underprivileged. We owe this to ourselves, to the Progressive Party, to the progressive citizens, but above all, we owe it to society and the interests of the society that we represent and serve.
