They wanted to hang SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance on the stake of national disgrace. However, in the end, it was his own candidate in Rodopi who was hanged by the decision of Mr Mitsotakis. The trap that they wanted to set for us - they were careless after all - and in this KYPagidiko document, their own candidate was listed as the first and best MP, and so he became the third in line to be crossed off the ballot papers, without being able to be removed. That is what Mr Mitsotakis is used to. In order to save himself, others are paying the price. That's what he did with his nephew in the wiretaps, that's what he's done now with three of his candidates so far. He chose them and supported them, he himself threw them off the ballot papers. Mr Pneuma of the separation of the sick into those who are worthy and those who are not worth saving, Mr Cricket of the savage racism that said 'good riddance, because if they came to Greece they would steal and rob' and the latest victim, now, Mr Katradzi in Rodopi. To prove not their character, but the character of Mr Mitsotakis himself, who came to do what? To send his sister to Thrace to blackmail, to terrorize, to intimidate weak people, poor people, people of the Muslim minority, and even in live broadcast. And tell them: "If you don't vote the right way, you will have a hard time in the next four years." Why? Because what bothers them is that there is a county, a district on the map that doesn't have their own electoral color, and they called it a "lump" on the map. That is their political culture.
