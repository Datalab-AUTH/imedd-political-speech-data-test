These are our programmatic positions, citizens of Patras. These positions put our values into practice. This is our program, which opposes the extreme neoliberal program of New Democracy next Sunday. But depending on one's program is the strategy for its implementation. Our strategy is one of strong democracy, civil society, participation and dialogue, of confrontation about what concerns people. This is the strategy with which we are fighting the electoral battle.
