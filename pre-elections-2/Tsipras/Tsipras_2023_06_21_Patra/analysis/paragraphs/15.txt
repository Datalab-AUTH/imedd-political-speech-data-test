Because, up until now, in their announcements and program, they say things that they do not intend to implement and carefully hide other things that they intend to implement. For example, the one unwittingly revealed by Mr. Pneumatikos, a candidate for the New Democracy Parliament and a renowned doctor. He explained to us that the New Democracy's plan for the National Health System is to privatize hospitals, close structures, cut spending, and, because it cannot be helped, select patients based on the cost of treatment and life expectancy. When we have two patients who ask for expensive treatment but one has a low life expectancy and the other has a longer life expectancy, they will give it to the one who has a longer life expectancy. The one who has no life expectancy will not get the expensive treatment. He should go to the private ones, and if he can't afford it, he will go home to die. That's the plan, that's their ideology, and that's our big difference. They count profits and losses, while we count human lives. That's our difference. After all, another minister said it a few months ago, Mr. Petsas, 'He who does not adapt, dies.' That is why we, the citizens of Patras, are saying that this Sunday is not just about deciding which party will come first and which will come second, but it is about deciding which program will be implemented over the next four years. Therefore, our lives are being decided.
