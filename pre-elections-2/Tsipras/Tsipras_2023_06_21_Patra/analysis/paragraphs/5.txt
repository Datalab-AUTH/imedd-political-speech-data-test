Those who are discounting the outcome, we would recommend that they do not rush to discount it. Citizens will be asked to judge on the basis of certain new facts: the unfavorable correlation for their lives resulting from the proportional representation ballots, the positions, attitude, arrogance, and lack of concealment of New Democracy between the two elections, the national levity shown on Thrace, the divisive intentions and threats, as well as everything that New Democracy's candidates revealed about its true program and plans. Based on this, citizens will be called upon to decide who they want in the government, how much power they want in the opposition, and who they want in the opposition. The dilemmas, as in every enhanced proportional representation ballot, will be tough. We do not make them; life itself makes them and the electoral system that this time gives a 50-seat bonus to the first party.
