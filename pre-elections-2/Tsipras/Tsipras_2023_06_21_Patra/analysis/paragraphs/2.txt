We will fight together, because that is what we have learned. To fight and not to run away. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance was born and grew in battles for our values, ideals, homeland, and human life, which for us makes no difference in color, religion, or nationality. We do not measure human life in euros or votes. We fight for the people who are fighting to make a better life for themselves and their children. For these people, we fight and will fight.
