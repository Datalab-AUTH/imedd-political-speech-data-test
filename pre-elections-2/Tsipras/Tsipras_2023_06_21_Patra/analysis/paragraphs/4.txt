And so it is now, because we know that the correlations are there to change, that history is written by the people. And nothing, believe me, is decided until the people put their stamp on it with their vote. Friends, citizens of Patras, next Sunday's election is a peculiar contest. It is very close and therefore in the shadow of the previous contest, but it is not the second round of the previous election. It is a new election. A contest, in fact, this time with a different electoral system, the enhanced proportional representation system. With a threatening, arrogant right-wing that seeks not just to win, but to become the regime from Monday. And with new dilemmas, much tougher, before the ballot box.
