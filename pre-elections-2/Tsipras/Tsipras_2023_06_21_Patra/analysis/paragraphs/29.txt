Our program also includes a reduction in indirect taxes, such as VAT on food and excise duty on fuel. Indirect taxes are unfair and burden the poor and middle classes, contrary to what Mr. Mitsotakis, who is following Trump's policies, is trying to convince us. He tells a big lie and makes it seem like the truth. Our plan, which we have not hidden, is not to tax the middle and lower classes, but to tax the great obscenity of super-profits made by energy and refinery cartels, who have taken advantage of the crisis to enrich themselves and have accumulated over 6 billion in super-profits at the expense of society, the economy, and citizens.
