That is why today I want to call on every progressive, democratic citizen to realize that the stakes of the ballot box on the 25th of this month are not whether we will have stability or government the next day. It is not whether we will have third elections in August, as Mr Mitsotakis is blackmailing us, but whether the next day we will allow, with our vote, a regime that is uncontrolled, unregulated, dangerous for the social majority, but also a return to situations that have cost society and the country dearly.
