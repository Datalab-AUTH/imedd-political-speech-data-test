And they tried, I want to remind you, many times to take us out of the way, but they did not succeed then, when everything was overshadowed by the fear of the lenders and the memoranda. They will not succeed now either because we know that lost struggles are only those that are not given, and we have never been cowardly enough to give the fight under the most difficult circumstances. When some people had written us off and said that we would leave the country in helicopters, remember then... We did not run away, and we came out victorious in that fight. We settled the public debt, got the country out of the memoranda, left 40 billion in the public coffers, and we are proud that the conservative party sunk the country into memoranda and bankruptcy, and we were the ones who got the country out of the memoranda and bankruptcy.
