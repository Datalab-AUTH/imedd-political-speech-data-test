But be careful, Bakoyannis' message was not addressed to the Muslim minority. She said it in front of the cameras because she wanted to reach every home, every household, and every social group. It was a message that if any social group stands against the plans or regime of the party or the "Holy Family" tomorrow, they will have a hard time. Today it is the minority, tomorrow it will be the teachers, the day after tomorrow it will be the nurses, the day after that it will be the employees, cultural workers, and young people.
