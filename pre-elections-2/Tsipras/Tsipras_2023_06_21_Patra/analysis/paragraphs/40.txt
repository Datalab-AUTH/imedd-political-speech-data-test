Such as these wretched and dangerous games, they did not hesitate to play even with our sensitive national issues, such as Thrace and the minority, and with the National Intelligence Service as a tool, which they seem to consider their own tool, even an electoral tool. For a few thousand votes, they did not hesitate to attempt to take us back, way back, to the dark days of division. They did not hesitate to divide Greeks into 'nationalists' and 'miasmas' and to call us 'national exceptions', 'minority'. But you have seen the end of this dark history. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance gave them a great lesson in democracy, responsibility, and patriotism. A lesson they will remember for a long time. Because we do not play games with the homeland!
