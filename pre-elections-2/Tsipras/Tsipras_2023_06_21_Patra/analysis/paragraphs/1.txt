Citizens of Patras are here together again, present and united in the call for hope, justice, life, and SYRIZA. Your presence today is even more important than a month ago when we filled this square. Today is a message of confidence and determination. Together, we will fight to reverse the results of the May ballot until the last second on Sunday. But on Monday, we will still be together. With your support, we will always be there for society and those we represent. Our commitment is to make SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance and the progressive democratic party of the country the government again soon. So that we can put into practice the hopes of the majority of Greek society. Because SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is and will remain the party in power, not a party of protest or a supplement to right-wing governments.
