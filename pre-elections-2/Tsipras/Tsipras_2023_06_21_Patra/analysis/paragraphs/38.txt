Unfortunately, this seems to have been accepted as fate by the smaller parties in the progressive space. They are closing their eyes to the now obvious project of the right and opening the way for it - whether they realize it or not. Objectively, they are pouring water into their own mill. With their anti-Syriza empathies, they have thrown away a historic possibility for the country with simple proportional representation: the possibility of a government of progressive cooperation by undermining simple proportional representation from beginning to end. As, of course, with these miserable tactics of frivolity and micro-ambition, with the so-called two-front, which was and still is in fact one-front against SYRIZA. Because when we were giving them the hand of cooperation, they were looking at how to cut off our hand, and they were not looking at the one who was governing, Mr Mitsotakis, who was coming unchecked, unchecked to come back for another four years of conservative and right-wing politics. So we must say clearly what I believe every democratic citizen understands: that this is an attitude that objectively favors the right. It is a contribution to the plans of Mr Mitsotakis.
