And today, I want to address the question not only to all of us who are here in this square but to all the democratic citizens of Patras: Will the democratic people of Achaia accept this? Will the citizens of Patras, which are synonymous with the struggle for democracy, accept this? Does a democracy without counterweights, without a robust opposition, without the oxygen of opposition and resistance really benefit anybody else except the interconnection and the elites? Mr. Mitsotakis started out as a politician wanting to be like Macron, but he has become a spitting image of Orban. He does and believes the same in immigration policy, the same in foreign policy issues, hand in hand with the far right, the same in democratic rights, the same in methods such as illegal surveillance, with the predator of his political opponents, of the country's economic agents. This is what he wants to do to Greece. A country of controlled democracy of the type of Orban's Hungary. That's what he is seeking.
