Against this plan, SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is presenting a fair, progressive, and realistic program. The program and plan look to the future with optimism because they have at their core the utilization of human potential, modernity, and social justice. They envision a new model of economic development that makes room for innovation, knowledge, the fair distribution of resources, the reduction of inequalities, and closes the door on the logic of state-led entrepreneurship, takeovers, and privatizations, ostensibly presented as investments.
