On the other hand, the strategy of New Democracy is on the opposite side. Its program copies the textbooks of neoliberalism and Machiavellian tactics. The strategy and plan of New Democracy - they make no secret of it - is not only to win but also to weaken their main rival, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance. The only force that can look them in the eye and prevent them from setting up an uncontrollable regime, because that is what they have been seeking since Monday. Their plan - and we must say this clearly to the citizens by Sunday, to the democratic and progressive citizens - is a fragmented and paralyzed opposition of small civil wars, of small parties. A fragmented opposition, so that it cannot put up any serious resistance to their policies, with many small parties in parliament. This is what they are seeking. They are seeking a parliament with six and seven parties. And you can see who these parties are that are inflating and over-promoting in this election period. Which are helping this planning. And why do they want this? So that the parliament can't have seriousness and credibility, so that the opposition can't be effective. The election strategy of Mr. Mitsotakis is the strategy of divide and rule! These three words sum up his strategy.
