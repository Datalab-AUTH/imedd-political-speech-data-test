Citizens of Heraklion, I warmly thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm welcome, for the determination and optimism with which you fill us today! Thank you, because it is even more important that this time we have refilled this square! And we are and will be here. This is the promise we make to the democratic citizens, to the citizens of Heraklion, to the citizens of all of Greece! We are here again together and we will be together in every difficult battle. We will be together in the easy and in the difficult. And together we will fight until Sunday to raise the flag of justice, to keep the flame of hope for a just society alive! But the promise does not end until Sunday. We will be together on Monday. Together we will move forward to lift the Progressive Party back to where it deserves to be.
