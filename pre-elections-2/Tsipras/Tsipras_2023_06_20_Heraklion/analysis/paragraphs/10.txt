But we also proved it when we made difficult decisions to consolidate peace in the Balkans with the Prespa Agreement, which was recognized by all of Europe for its importance in maintaining stability in our region. At a time when "Old Gerun" and "Vasta Sch√§uble" were wearing fezzes and attending rallies with Golden Dawn, asking us to declare our nationalism once again, it was us who were defending the interests of our homeland. We made a deal to fly Greek F-16s over the airspace of our northern neighbors and we did not leave Libya on our northern border for Turkey to exploit. So we are proud of this entire journey. We are proud that we have always put the country before party costs, that we have never counted the cost of defending values, people, the homeland, or social justice. That is why today we will not allow any hypocrites or sellers of nationalism to question our patriotic responsibility.
