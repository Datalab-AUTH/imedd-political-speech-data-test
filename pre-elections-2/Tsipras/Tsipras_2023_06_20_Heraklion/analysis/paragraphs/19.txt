And I want to remind you, because this is the main difference between SYRIZA and New Democracy, that we did everything we could to support public healthcare in the most difficult fiscal conditions. We included 2.5 million of our uninsured fellow citizens in the healthcare system so that they could have access to healthcare. We are the ones who, in the toughest fiscal times, hired to keep hospitals afloat. We made over 300 permanent hires of rescuers in the EMS and brought in 143 new ambulances.
