Citizens of Heraklion, I think you know the old saying: "You may fall, but you must get up." And we have already gotten up, we are up and fighting, and we will be up and fighting until Sunday and Monday together. Because we owe it to the Progressive Party, to the progressive citizens, but above all to society, whose interests we serve. And it is for this society, for these people of creation, for the workers, the employed, the scientists, the young people, for those who live by their labor and not by the labor of others, that each and every one of us in the coming days must and will be found in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every home, in every village, in every workplace. So that not a single vote is wasted. To give strength to hope, to resistance. To give perspective to Greek society. To not let the hope of justice for prosperity for all, for a just society, be extinguished. This struggle until Sunday, but also from the next day, is a struggle of ideas, it is a struggle of dignity. And we will fight it together. And we will win it together! Because we are on the right side of history. So I call upon you to fight this battle and to win it. To fight this battle uncompromisingly, unyieldingly, with determination. We are and will be on the right side of history. Be well, good strength, and good fight until Sunday. And the next day, together! Together we will go forward in the great struggle to rebuild the Progressive Party of the land until the government of the land is in place! Until it becomes governed again! Hello, goodbye, good strength!
