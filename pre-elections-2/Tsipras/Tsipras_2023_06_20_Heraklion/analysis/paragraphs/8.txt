The Democratic and Progressive Party in our country has always been guided by patriotic responsibility, and SYRIZA today is no exception. Patriotic responsibility means putting the interests of the country above petty party interests, and SYRIZA has consistently demonstrated this over the years. Every citizen knows it, from Orestiada to Kastelorizo. We demonstrated it when we fought against the beasts of Europe, when we pulled Greece out of the memoranda, at a time when we were all written off.
