I just want to remind you of this image: your fellow Cretan from Chania, Dora Bakoyannis, went to speak - note what I am going to say, it is not the face that matters, it is the substance that matters - to these poor people in Thrace, to the Muslim minority. In front of the cameras, she said to them: "If you don't vote for New Democracy this time," as the other MP said, "if there's a blip on the map with a different color," that bothers them, "you will have four difficult years." And this message was not only going to the Muslim minority, so she said it in front of the cameras. It went to every home, every family, every social group. "If you resist the plans, the will of the regime, the party and the family, you will have a hard time!"
