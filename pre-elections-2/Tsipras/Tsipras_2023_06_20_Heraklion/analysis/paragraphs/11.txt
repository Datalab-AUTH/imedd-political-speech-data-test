Citizens of Heraklion, friends, at the ballot box next Sunday, we know that we have a difficult task: to reverse the unfavorable correlation that the ballot of the simple proportional representation recorded a month ago. However, I want you to bear in mind that this election is not the second round, it is not a continuation of the previous one. It is a new election with a new electoral system, a new arrangement of political forces, and new dilemmas. And I want to say to those who are in a hurry to discount the outcome of the popular verdict, don't do it. Because the citizens will now be called upon to decide once and for all how and who will govern the country for the next four years. What is being decided now, at this ballot box, is our lives in the next four years. Who and how and with what program will be in government, who and with what forces in opposition, and what will be the most favorable conditions for the life of citizens. And in this ballot, as in any ballot with enhanced proportional representation, the dilemmas are tough. We do not make them. They are set by the electoral system that gives a 50-seat bonus to the first party. The same electoral system that has been in place in most elections. Simple proportional representation was defeated in the last election, mainly because we extended the hand of cooperation to all the progressive forces, and they were looking to cut off our hand. We were looking at how to govern the country and what the country's interests were, and they were looking at how to grow their own field, not caring whether they would leave the way open for an unchecked, extreme, and neoliberal right to sweep away political and social rights the next day.
