Well, we will be here to support every social group that wants to breathe, that wants to live. Because democracy must breathe! Greece means a strong democracy and SYRIZA will be here to have a strong democracy, a strong society in the next day! So we are and will be here as a force of resistance to the Right and its plans. To defend every social group that is under attack. To fight for their rights, against the logic of flattening and regimentation. So there is one message we are sending out from our rally today: we will not bend, we will not compromise, we will not retreat.
