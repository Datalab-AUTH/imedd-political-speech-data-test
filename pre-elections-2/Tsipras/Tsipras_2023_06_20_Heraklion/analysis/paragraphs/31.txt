But now the time of crisis is coming, and we want to tell the Greek people the truth. We want them to hear the truth, even now, just a few days before the elections. Because after the ballot box, no mistake is recognized, and we will have a four-year term that will be tough and difficult. We are running out of benefits in a few days, in a few months, and the European Union's fiscal loosening is ending. If the plan remains to strengthen the strong and shrink the middle and low incomes, then this will lead to new social conflicts and tensions. Greek society must be aware of this and will face difficult situations.
