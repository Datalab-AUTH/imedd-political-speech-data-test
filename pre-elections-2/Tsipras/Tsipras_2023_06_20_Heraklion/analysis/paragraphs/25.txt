Their plan, they openly say, is also to abolish Article 16 and private universities. And who is Mr Mitsotakis' advocate in this plan? Mr Mitsotakis has been saying it for years. But who is his advocate in this plan? Mr Androulakis' PASOK, and unfortunately Mr Androulakis himself. He is willing, if New Democracy does not have a majority, to assist with his own MPs in changing the Constitution. With the basis for the introduction of Mrs Kerameos, they have taken the first step. They cut thousands of students from higher education and sent them to colleges. There they did not ask them for an admission basis, they asked them to have a strong pocket, to pay tuition fees. They took the first step, but it was not only about young people who were left out of public universities, it was also about the plan to leave dozens of faculties and departments, especially in the region, without students and to start closing down departments and faculties gradually. And where? In the Region, which is hungry for life, for knowledge, for economic development. Which is bleeding with the brain drain not only abroad but also towards the centre, the capital, Athens. Why? To make room for obscenity.
