The programme of New Democracy, friends, is the one and only programme that Mr Mitsotakis presented to our European partners, the European Commission in Brussels, as a stability programme two months ago. No matter what they tell us, no matter what they promise, this is their real programme. And their real programme has nothing to do with what Mr Mitsotakis announced lavishly during the election campaign. None of the announcements that he made during the election are part of the medium-term plan that he submitted to Brussels two months ago.
