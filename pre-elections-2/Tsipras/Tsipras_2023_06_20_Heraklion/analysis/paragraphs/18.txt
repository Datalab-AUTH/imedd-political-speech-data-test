What the MP and candidate for New Democracy told us is that Mr. Mitsotakis' plan is to privatize hospitals, close public structures, and put private individuals and managers in charge of them. This is because healthcare is very expensive and the state cannot afford it. He also mentioned that public hospitals will not be able to meet the needs of society without spending. They will even screen patients based on the cost of treatment and life expectancy. If a patient comes in with a low life expectancy and wants an expensive treatment, it will be given to the one with a higher life expectancy. And for those with no life expectancy, they will go to private hospitals. If they cannot afford it, "Whoever does not adapt dies," as another minister of New Democracy, Mr. Petsas, told us. This is Mr. Mitsotakis' plan for healthcare.
