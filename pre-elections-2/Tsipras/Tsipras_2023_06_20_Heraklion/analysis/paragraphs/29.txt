But these are the real plans of our political opponents. This is their program and plan, both hidden and obvious. The withdrawal of the state from critical sectors, privatizations, tax breaks for the rich, and the reduction of labor rights. They believe that this will eventually bring great growth and that it will spread throughout society like crumbs falling from the table at a great feast. They call it trickle-down economics in the United States, but it has never worked. Neoliberalism has no success stories anywhere. It has stories of social explosion, widening inequalities, and failure in both Europe and the US. That is why we say that this project and program are not the future, but rather yesterday. We must leave it behind to create a society of justice and prosperity for all.
