And then, I remind you, when we were fighting the negotiation battle to exploit every loophole in order to serve the public interest and the interests of society, when we were taking the country out of the memoranda, regulating the debt and leaving 40 billion in the public coffers, when we were fighting this battle and our political opponents, you remember what they were shouting: 'Vasta Schaeuble' and 'Old Gerun'. So we proved then that we were defending the public interest, the social interest and the country. Our guiding principle has always been the interests of the country.
