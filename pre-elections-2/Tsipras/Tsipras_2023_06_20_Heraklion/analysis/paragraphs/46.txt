Citizens of Heraklion, these are the positions and programs of New Democracy and Syriza, which are opposed in this election. With these positions and this program, we will stand against New Democracy. We will defend and promote these positions and this program. But I want to tell you that apart from programs, there are also strategies. Strategies that are also in conflict. You know our strategy; it is a strategy for an inclusive society. We have always had an open hand of cooperation with progressive political forces, and we have always dealt with our political opponents with political culture.
