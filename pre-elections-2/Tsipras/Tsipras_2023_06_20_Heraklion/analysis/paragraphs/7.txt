But you have witnessed the end of this dark story. In the gallows that were set up for SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, their own candidate in Rodopi was finally hanged by the decision of Mr. Mitsotakis himself. And with it, the so-called seriousness, national responsibility, and European identity were also hanged. Sometimes there is nemesis in politics. Let them keep that in mind. We say it today so that they understand well that they will always have us against them, and they will always find us in front of them when they are inflicting suffering on society and the country. Because we, the citizens of Heraklion, will not play with our country. This is the message we have sent out these days when our opponents display their irresponsibility and cynicism.
