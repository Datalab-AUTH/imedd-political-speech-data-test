And the only force that can prevent this is SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance. The only thing that can prevent this is the decisive strengthening of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. It is the reversal of the correlations that were formed in May. We therefore call today on every progressive and every democratic citizen, but also on every democratic citizen who wants to have a government on the 26th and not a regime, despite their differences and reservations they may have with us, to strengthen SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance with their vote on the coming Sunday. So that we do not allow Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy to get a blank cheque. To give space to the resistance, to society, to the needs of the many.
