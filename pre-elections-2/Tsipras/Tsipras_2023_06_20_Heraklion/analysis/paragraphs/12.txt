So unfortunately, the dilemmas are tough once again. This Sunday, the Greek people have only two alternative strategies at their discretion, two alternative power programs, because there are only two parties in power in our country. The first is the Right, represented by New Democracy, and the second is SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, which will never become a party that complements its political opponents in governments of the Right. It will never be a party of protest, but rather a party of power. Together, we will make SYRIZA the government of the country and the progressive Party of the country a governing force that will give perspective and hope to the world of work and the majority of Greek society. Therefore, there are two programs and two strategies: the strategy and program of the outgoing government, New Democracy, and the strategy and program of the opposition, Syriza.
