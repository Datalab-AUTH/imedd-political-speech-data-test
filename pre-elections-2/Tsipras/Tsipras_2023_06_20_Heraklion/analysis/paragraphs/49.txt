And I want to address the question from here, from democratic Heraklion: Will the democratic people of our country tolerate this? Will the democratic people of Crete, who have always put democracy and freedom above all else, even the conservative citizen accept this? Does it please anyone other than the interconnection and the elites to have a democracy without counterweights, without effective opposition, robust, without the health of opposition and resistance? A sick, weak, unstable Orb√°n-type democracy in Hungary? Does this benefit democracy? Unfortunately, what I am now describing has been accepted by the smaller parties, even those in the progressive area, and they are making room for New Democracy to get through without too many problems and serious resistance. By their refusal even to discuss, in the previous phase, the possibility of a government of progressive cooperation. By undermining the simple proportional representation. With the so-called two-front, which in practice was one-front against SYRIZA.
