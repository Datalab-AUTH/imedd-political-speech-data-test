But New Democracy has another plan and strategy, which they do not hide. Their goal is not only to win, but also to weaken SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, the only force that can prevent them from establishing an uncontrollable regime. Their plan is to create a fragmented opposition, paralyzed by small civil wars between small parties, unable to mount a serious resistance to their policies. Mr. Mitsotakis' basic plan is for the next Parliament to have 7, or even 8, parties, to have a discredited parliament where they can have ad hoc consultations with opposition parties. Some of those who are not in the House are being inflated and promoted during the election to pass the threshold of entry, which helps Mitsotakis' planning. He doesn't just want to be prime minister again on the 26th, he wants to be a ruler. He has Machiavelli's infamous Hegemon as his guide, advising aspiring rulers first and foremost of one thing: Divide and conquer! These three words sum up the strategy of New Democracy today.
