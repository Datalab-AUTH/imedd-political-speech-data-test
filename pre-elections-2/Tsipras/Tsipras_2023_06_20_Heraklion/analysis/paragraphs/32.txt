Against this plan, we contrast the plan and programme of Syriza. A solid, fair, and progressive programme for society and the country, which is also realistic. The programme and plan look to the future with optimism because they have at their core the utilization of human potential, modernity, and social justice. They envisage a new model of economic growth based on innovation, knowledge, the fair distribution of resources, and the reduction of inequalities. In the face of the logic of state-owned entrepreneurship, takeovers, and privatisations presented as investments, we have a plan that is a new productive model, supporting the needs of society, the middle class, wage labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, livestock farmers, and young people.
