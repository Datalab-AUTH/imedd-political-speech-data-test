What they did with PPC, they want to do with healthcare, they want to do with education, they want to do with water. That's why they voted for the Regulatory Authority three months ago. And now that they have seen the reactions and resistance of society, they are supposedly boasting that they will return EYDAP and EYDATH to the Ministry of Infrastructure. But what are you telling us? This is a decision of the CoE and you are obliged to do so! But your plans for privatization remain alive on the table, and do not fool the Greek citizens! Otherwise, abolish the Regulatory Authority that you voted for three months ago.
