Mr. Mitsotakis has not had the Troika over his head for 4 years now. He has no budgetary restrictions and has not made a single permanent recruitment of rescuers in the ambulance service. As a result, people are running away like dogs in the backs of farm cars because there are no ambulances to transport them.
