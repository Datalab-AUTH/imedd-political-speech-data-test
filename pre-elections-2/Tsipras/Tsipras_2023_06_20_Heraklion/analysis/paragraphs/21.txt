This is the essential top difference between the program of New Democracy and the program of Syriza. To put it simply, we are talking about human lives, and they are talking about profits and losses. We put people first; they put profits first. That is our big difference! But it is not only health that highlights this top contrast between the two alternative programs. It is almost every area of social and economic life.
