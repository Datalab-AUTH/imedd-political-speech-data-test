In this electoral battle, citizens of Heraklion and friends, we can all see how ruthless our political opponents, the right-wing led by Mr. Mitsotakis, are. Their only goal is not just to win the elections, but to get rid of the SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance so that they have no opponent who can challenge them. To achieve this, they have gone beyond all limits in this electoral battle, even resorting to throwing sensitive national issues such as the issue of Thrace and the Muslim minority into the electoral arena.
