And since I am in a place of history, I can't help but think of many of the things that important people have said in this place. And one of them was Nikos Kazantzakis who said, "Do not deign to ask: 'Will we win? Are we going to win?' Only fight!" That is what we have been doing from day one in SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. We fight! We have learned through hardship, victories and defeats, successes and failures. We have never stopped fighting for what we consider to be just and human. And we have never counted the political cost when it came to defending our values and our ideals. We fight for the value of human life, which for us has no color, no religion, no nationality. It is for this value that we are fighting the battle, for what is just for society and for Greece, for the ordinary people who are struggling to build a better life for themselves and their children. It is for these values and for these people that we are fighting. And it has not been just one or two times that they have tried, throughout this journey that we are walking together, to take us out of the way. They didn't succeed then, I remind you, when we were fighting the creditors and the bankruptcy of the country, and do you think they will succeed now? We got away from the beasts, we won't be eaten by the bugs! Here we are and here we will be to fight together!
