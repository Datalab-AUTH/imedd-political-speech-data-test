We respond from here, from Heraklion, from Crete, with an old rizitiko: "The door of the manly man will always be open. We come from far away and we will go far away. We are a mature child of necessity. We are here to express the anxieties and struggles of Greek society. Our identity has been seen and experienced by Greece in difficult times, in conditions of government and opposition. We are and will be the great, dynamic, uncompromising force of the Left, the great pole of the democratic and progressive party of the country, which has never been in league with the Right. And it will never go along with the Right. It will never become a complement to the Right Government, which will never support Right-wing policies.
