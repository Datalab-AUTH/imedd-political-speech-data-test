And I don't think there is a person, regardless of their political party, who doesn't understand that. This attitude objectively favors the right, to put it bluntly. To recall an old phrase, "it is pouring water into the mill of Mr. Mitsotakis' right-wing." That is why today, from here in Heraklion, I want to address every progressive and democratic citizen and call on them to realize that the stakes of the ballot box on the 25th of this month are not whether we will have a government the next day, but whether the next day we will allow an uncontrolled and unregulated regime to be created with our vote. Those are the stakes of the ballot.
