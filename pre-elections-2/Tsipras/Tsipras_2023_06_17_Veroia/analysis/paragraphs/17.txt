A fourth equally important programmatic issue, where there is also a hidden agenda, is the issue of auctions of first homes. We are told that there is no issue with first home auctions. What our eyes see are the crippled man in Halkidiki sleeping outside his house because he was a guarantor on his unemployed son's loan, the mother of a single-parent family in Petralona who walked out of her house because she owed 10,000 euros, and dozens of cases that are obviously not shown in the media. As we know, in our country, we have the privilege and peculiarity of being in the hundred and eighth place in the world in terms of media pluralism, but these images will be images of our everyday life the next day. They will be images that we will see everywhere. Why? Because 700,000 mortgages on first homes, commercial housing, and farmland have been passed from banks to funds, and the funds have a plan. They bought them for 15-20% of the value and they want to auction them off to get 100% of the market value. And they will auction them off because that is Mitsotakis' hidden plan. The biggest property redistribution the country has seen since WWII.
