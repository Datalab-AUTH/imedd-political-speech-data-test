Instead, we have a plan to regulate fairly in order to support not only the weak but also the middle class. We will enable them to repay their loans gradually with a significant reduction in the nominal value of the debt. It is not fair for funds to make excessive profits from the property of the middle class. With state support, we aim to keep houses, business properties, workers' land, and agricultural land in the hands and ownership of the middle class and the weak.
