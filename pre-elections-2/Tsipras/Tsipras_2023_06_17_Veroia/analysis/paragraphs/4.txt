I will say one phrase: the programme of New Democracy says things that are not going to be implemented and it hides things that are planned to be implemented. I want to talk to you a little bit about them. Mr. Mitsotakis submitted a medium-term programme, as all governments are obliged to do to the European Union and European institutions, two months ago. The medium-term is binding on governments, and I have full experience. In it, you detail what you are going to do and what fiscal space is left over to do things. Two months ago, they submitted a medium-term. Of all his programmatic announcements in this and the previous election, not a single one is included in the medium-term program he submitted to the European Commission. So he is lying when he promises 10,000 jobs in the public hospitals that he has deliberately allowed to collapse. He is lying because there is no provision for recruitment in the medium-term programme. The only provision is to replace all those who are leaving the public sector.
