And I want to close by saying that this concerns Imathia, it concerns your prefecture. A county that has been abandoned during these four years. And you know it very well, and those of you who see Veroia and Imathia aging, young people leaving your place to search, to look for a better job away from home because there are no jobs. Because agricultural production has been degraded and abandoned. This place should have hundreds of businesses with young people, young farmers, and young entrepreneurs involved in strong quality food products, fruit. That does not exist in your place, it does not exist. The farmers, the producers see that Greece is the country with the biggest difference between the price that the producer pays in the field and the price that the consumer finds on the shelf, over 300% difference. All for the middlemen. So your city, Veroia, and your law, the prefecture of Imathia should know that the next day will be a difficult day anyway. So we need and we call on all Veroys and Imathiotes, democratic and progressive, to have a strong voice of social resistance, of social justice. So we all need to give our strengths so that there is no monopoly in parliamentary representation in Imathia, so that the seat of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance can be taken, so that its percentage can rise, so that it can stand next day next to the producer, the small and medium-sized businessman, the pensioner, the young people who want to stay and create in their place. That is why I call on you to fight this fight to the end, to fight it together, house to house, mouth to mouth, to strengthen the momentum of the revolution. Let's go together for the reversal, let's go together for the new struggles to come. Thank you, be well.
