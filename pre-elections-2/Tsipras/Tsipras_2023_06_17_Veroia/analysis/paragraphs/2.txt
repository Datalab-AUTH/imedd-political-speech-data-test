There are two alternative programs of governance and two parties in power because SYRIZA was and will remain a party in power. It will not become a party of protest, but it will not become a party that complements the governments of the right. We will fight together until the last second before the polls close to overturn the unfavorable correlation recorded on May 21. But we will, and this is my promise to you here, fight the battle together on the 25th and 26th and the next day. We will fight the battle together to defend our values and to defend Greek society. These are difficult days ahead. I want to speak in the language of truth. These are difficult days ahead. And the country needs a strong force, a strong SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance to stand by society, by people who have no voice, to demand the obvious, which is not so obvious against a vengeful right-wing.
