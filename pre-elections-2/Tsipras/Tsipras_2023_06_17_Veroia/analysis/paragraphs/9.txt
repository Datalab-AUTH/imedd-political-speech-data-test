What is it that he says he will not do? He will not implement what he announced in terms of hiring and tax cuts. What are the things he is not saying but preparing to do? Mr. Pneimatikos, the New Democracy parliamentary candidate and authoritative professor, unwittingly revealed that the health plan of New Democracy and Mr. Mitsotakis is to privatize hospitals, close public institutions, reduce public spending, and even sort out patients. The medium-term plan confirms this. Mitsotakis warned us that we would shudder at his health plan, and now it is time to shudder. Patient triage means that someone with a low life expectancy will not receive treatment at a public hospital because they will be chosen to give treatment to someone with a longer life expectancy. Anyone without a life expectancy can go to a private hospital. This is the cynical neoliberal view of the welfare state and public health.
