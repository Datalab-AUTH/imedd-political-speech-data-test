So I was saying that they are avoiding the debate on the program. In fact, they even made sure to exploit a dramatic and tragic event - the shipwreck with over 600 dead. Over 600 people drowned, and the sea became a watery grave for them. They used the shipwreck to scuttle the debate of the political leaders. Because Mr. Mitsotakis has been scared as the devil of dialogue on programs from the very first moment. He promised a dialogue between the two of us, he ran away, and now he has used a dramatic event to permanently thwart political dialogue in front of the Greek citizen TV audience. But why is he so afraid of dialogue on programs?
