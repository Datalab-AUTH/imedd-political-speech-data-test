I only referred to four critical issues that I think are the core of the programmatic debate that Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy are denying, carefully avoiding the issue of the National Health System, the issue of accuracy, the crucial issue of the auctions - auctions that, I beg your pardon, will be carried out by those who owe 400 million to the banks, their party, borrowed and unpaid, and will never return them to the Greek people. The National Health System, auctions, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the issue of price fixing are, for us, the biggest issues of the programmatic agenda that we want to discuss, to put them to the judgment of the Greek people in view of the crucial election on June 25th.
