I would like to thank you for the welcome in today's rainy Veria. Your presence is touching and it is a great pleasure for me to be here in Veroia to share with you the message of the battle in view of the elections of 25 June. This is a battle that we will fight together, as we have fought all the battles we have fought so far, and a battle that we will fight with greater tenacity and determination. One week from today, on June 25, the Sunday after next, what will be decided at the ballot box is how and by whom the country will be governed for the next four years. This ballot is not a simple proportional representation ballot, but it is a ballot with the old familiar, traditional system that we have known all these years. The first one in will get 50 bonus seats, so it is crucial to see who it will be and how, with what programme, he will govern the country for the next four years. Unfortunately or fortunately, we know that in the enhanced proportional representation ballot, the dilemmas are inexorable. There is no such thing as a loose vote. Our political opponents clearly do not just want to win the election. They want to establish an uncontrolled and unregulated regime and they are avoiding the debate on programme positions like the devil avoids incense. With what programme, with what plan will they or we rule the country for the next four years? And I say either them or us, because there are two alternative plans of governance.
