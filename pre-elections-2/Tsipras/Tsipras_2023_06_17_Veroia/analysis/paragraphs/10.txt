Against the hidden agenda of New Democracy, we have our own plan and programme. Our plan prioritizes human life and does not discriminate based on economic ability, race, religion, or color. Our main priority is a healthcare system that is open and accessible to all citizens, regardless of economic ability. We will strengthen public hospitals by recruiting doctors and nurses and utilizing resources from the Recovery Fund. The outgoing government only allocated 2% of the Recovery Fund resources for public health, while other European countries, mainly in the European South, provide more than 10%. We have a plan to support the NHS, its workers, and primary healthcare. When we were in government under tough fiscal pressure, we integrated two and a half million uninsured people into the National Health System. No citizen, insured or uninsured, is left out of the healthcare system.
