Citizens of Achaia! Yesterday Athens decided. Today Patras seals the Contract of Change! Our gathering today leaves no more questions, no more possibilities. On Sunday the nightmare ends, change dawns! I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this sensational rally and this message of victory, this message of victory that you are giving here today from democratic Achaia. I have chosen to close from here, from Patras, this election campaign, this election race, from Patras, Achaia, Western Greece, where the Right has always been and will always be in the minority. Because the message I am sending is that on Sunday they will be in the minority all over Greece! On Sunday, with the vote of the Greek people, we say good night to Mr Mitsotakis and we say good morning to Change! To a new Greece of hope, certainty and perspective.

Citizens of Achaia, today with your presence here, we are sending a message to all of Greece that we will not be terrorized by terrorists. We will terrorize them with our vote on Sunday. From here, from the castle of the great democratic party, we are standing up today against injustice, against insecurity. And we extend the hand of unity and cooperation to every democrat, every progressive citizen of our country. To those who have walked along other paths, perhaps, but always in the same direction. Towards justice, towards democracy, towards progress, towards change. And we say to them, we say to every democratic and progressive citizen today: We are not here to repeat or rewrite history. We are here to open together from Monday a new chapter in the history of our country! The chapter of change in Greece in the third decade of the 21st century. The chapter of the progressive government of cooperation that will open on Monday, after the vote of our people on Sunday. A government that will redeem the country from the worst right-wing government since the post-independence period and open the chapter of collective progress for a people who are asking for justice, for the younger generations who are hungry for better days, for a better life.

Citizens of Patras, for four years an entire society has experienced the doctrine of shock from the man who promised better jobs, better wages and care for the middle class. And where did he, four years later, reduce the middle class to? He reduced it to living on food stamps. Supermarket vouchers, electricity vouchers, petrol vouchers.

But here we are today, at the last turn before the polls, in his last interview on his beloved SKY, he let slip and told us what his plan is for the middle class. His plan is, watch what he said, to punish and crush, that is what he said, those are the words he used, to punish and crush the borrowers who managed to save their homes from the Katseli law. That is what he said verbatim. And so we understood why in the last few hours he has been insisting so much that supposedly we have a hidden agenda in our programme. Because he wants this distraction to make people look the other way while he is getting ready to take away their property, to take away their houses in the auctions. And if some younger people did not remember or some older people forgot, he came to remind us what the right-wing means, the worst right-wing government since the post-war period, the government of Mr Mitsotakis. So we say it clearly from George Square today, so that all of Greece can hear it: On Sunday, Mitsotakis' plans for the largest redistribution of property that has ever taken place in the country since the Second World War, for 700,000 auctions of first homes, for 700,000 evictions, on Sunday, the Greek people will thwart these plans!

Because with their vote, the people will evict Mr Mitsotakis from the Maximou building this Sunday. Not Mr. Mitsotakis from the middle class! And I want to say it clearly: After yesterday's rally in Athens, after all the rallies we have held, which have nothing to do with this climate that the propaganda wants to create for us, which wants to terrorize hope, and after our rally here in Patras today, it is now obvious: Go away, Mr Mitsotakis. Today Patras is telling you. Go away! Pack your things from now on. Rip out the Predator cables there in Maximou! Gather the evidence of the crime. From Monday, the Maximus Megaron goes from being a centre of illegal surveillance to the headquarters of the Republic. It is once again becoming the headquarters of a progressive government that will take on the difficult task of getting society back on its feet, getting the economy back on its feet, and restoring hope to the vast majority of society.

The Greeks will not give Mr Mitsotakis a pass. They will not give a pass for what he has done in these four years in order to make the next four years worse. But really, how can they forgive him?

For the 37,000 who perished in the pandemic, and our hospitals that it is leaving in collapse.

For the salary that ends in the third week of the month. For the obscenity that is sweeping the income.

For robbing pensioners. The 13th pension and the retroactive payments he cut off, 7 billion in 4 years.

How can they forgive him for the thousands of kids he left out of our universities with the Minimum Admission Base? How can they forgive him for the blue grasshopper onslaught on the public wealth?

For the party of 10 billion assignments and widespread corruption.

How can citizens forgive him for his abuse of democracy? For the Maximos parastate that gave an ear to half of the political system, even the leadership of the Armed Forces?

How can the Greek citizens forgive him for his behaviour in the tragic accident at Tempe and especially his behaviour after the tragic accident, when 57 young people were unjustly lost? How can they forgive him for this brutal insult to the joyful parents of the victims in Tempe? For not even respecting their mourning and accusing them of instrumentalisation, as if the parents of the victims have in their minds whether Mr Mitsotakis has elections or not! He does not respect, he does not feel, he does not understand! How can one trust the future of this country to a man who does not feel? How can you trust the future of this country, of our children, for another four years to a man who does not feel?

So the Greek people will not forgive all that he has done in these four years. And on Sunday they will punish him, because he is unforgivable. And I am sure that those citizens who will decide at the ballot box at the last minute will think about everything they have experienced. And they will say: Enough of this nightmare. Enough of this obscenity. So much for family rule. Enough of this unworthiness. So much for indifference. So much for general injustice!

At the same time, I am sure that traditional voters, even these, the traditional voters of New Democracy, people of morality and conscience, will ask themselves: Which distance is greater? The one that separates the left from the right, or the one that separates humanity from insensitivity? Which is the greater distance? I am sure that on Sunday the collective conscience of the Greeks will speak. A people that abhors injustice. A people that punishes arrogance. And the vast majority of our people will vote for change. It will give a vote to SYRIZA. It will give victory to SYRIZA and a strong mandate for a progressive government of cooperation, long term and stability, which will reverse the course of the country. Citizens of Achaia, shout this slogan to me the day after tomorrow night, not today! The day after tomorrow evening, when the vote of our people has evicted Mr Mitsotakis from the Maximou Mansion!

Citizens of Patras, citizens of Achaia, we stand before you today, 48 hours before the polls. And we stand before you with a clean face, clean hands, but above all with a clean heart. Without a stain on our political record. We stand before you with clean hands and a clean heart, because we, under difficult circumstances, fought the battle, were tested and managed to get the country out of bankruptcy and out of the memoranda that others have thrown it into.

Because we did not manage the Greek people's money to build fortunes, but we managed the last euro of the Greek citizen with responsibility and honesty. And we left behind us, in the public coffers, 37 billion as a dowry to Greece, a dowry to stability. Imagine, we had an obligation to collect 40 billion and those who shouted at us, when we were pulling the country out of the memoranda, that we were signing a fourth one, had the opportunity to spend 60. Imagine if instead of having the obligation to raise 40, we had the leeway to spend 60. Is that how Greece would be today? Is this what public hospitals would be like? Is this what the schools would be like? Would obscenity choke the income of the average household pensioner?

Nobody believes that. Nobody believes it because they know that in the most difficult times we have always put the salvation of society, the salvation of the country and not the party's interests above all else. That is why today, looking the average Greek citizen in the eyes and all of you, with a clear heart, we say: We are not asking for a second chance, we are asking for a first chance to govern without memoranda, without the Troika! With our programme, on the basis of our will and not on the basis of our musts. A first chance to prove that the Left can support the weak, support the middle class, fight inequalities and create the prospect of a better Greece. We ask the Greek people to give us a first chance to govern on the basis of our programme and to approve the Contract of Change we propose by voting for SYRIZA next Sunday.

And I want to tell you, so that you can keep it in mind, that in the next 48 hours, to carry it everywhere, from house to house, from village to village, to every citizen, to every democratic citizen, four things that a vote for SYRIZA means this Sunday: a wage increase. A reduction in prices. A reduction in wages. And a fair, effective, strong welfare state next to the citizen. These are the four things that a vote for SYRIZA means!

This is our Contract, the Contract with the people, the Contract of Change. And this is what Achaia is sealing today with its rally. This Contract, citizens of Patras, is the roadmap of our governance. And at this point I want to make it clear: The Contract of Change, which we ask the people to ratify, binds us all to the letter. I will not and we will not allow anyone and no one to deviate a single line from this Contract. Because we are asking for the first chance to govern without memoranda, to support the weak and the middle class.

We do not foresee in our programme either tax increases or increases in contributions for the middle class. We do foresee tax cuts. We envisage a tax-free allowance of EUR 10 000 for self-employed people. We envisage the abolition of business tax. Reduction of VAT and fuel tax we foresee. Abolition of the VAT on agricultural and livestock oil. This is what our programme provides for. This is what we want, this is the Contract of Change that we call on the Greek people to ratify. Because we, the citizens of Patras, now have an additional reason. We have not only the political but also the moral obligation to support and give breath especially to the middle class, which was disproportionately burdened during the days of the memoranda and was brutally deceived by Mr Mitsotakis in 2019. With the Contract of Change, we are therefore making concrete and tangible commitments to the Greek people, to you.

The commitment to immediately increase the minimum wage to €880 and to introduce annual indexation. To increase, after 14 years, 10% of public sector wages.

We must restore the 13th pension, which Mr Mitsotakis abolished, we must give pensioners their retroactive payments and we must give all pensioners, including those who have been deprived of them today, the opportunity to receive increases under our law.

We also take on our commitment to abolish the labour jungle that Mr Mitsotakis introduced. We will restore the eight-hour working day, the Collective Agreements, paid overtime, the Labour Inspectorate, which they abolished so that the worker has no recourse.

We commit ourselves to decisively strengthen the National Health System, the public hospitals that have been left to collapse. To build more Local Health Units, to recruit all the auxiliary doctors and contract nurses who fought on the front line during the pandemic. Bring in a new salary scale with 2,000 as the first salary for the first appointed doctor, so that young people and scientists do not leave abroad. Stay here, staff the NHS. And get nursing staff into the heavy and unhealthy sector.

We are committed to increasing spending on education. To open the doors of our universities to the tens of thousands of children who are being left out by Mr Mitsotakis, with the long arm of Mrs Kerameos, with the Minimum Admission Base. Why is he doing this? To bring patronage to the colleges. And that is immoral. And it will be stopped by these national exams. We are committed to eliminating the substitute teacher phenomenon in secondary education. To double the resources and teachers in our universities. We will hire teachers, not police officers. Police officers will go into the neighborhoods to fight crime. Because the police will also stop cooperating with the Greek Mafia. It will fight the Greek Mafia.

We also make a commitment, citizens of Patras, to fight accuracy. With an immediate reduction of VAT on food, the VAT on fuel, with strict controls on the market.

We are committed to regulating private debt. To protect the first home, commercial housing and agricultural land, on the basis of the plan that we presented a few days ago, about a month ago, which has been signed by the politician who has linked her name to the protection of the first home during the difficult years of the memorandum, Luca Katseli.

We are committed to regaining public control of the PPC, which Mr Mitsotakis sold off before the energy crisis. The PPC will become public again! The commitment to prevent the privatisation of water. Water will remain a public good.

The commitment to regain a public pillar in the banking system, so that small and medium-sized entrepreneurs can have access to finance and not just a few large companies that do not need to borrow.

Finally, a commitment to support people with disabilities by generously increasing their benefits, radically reforming the diagnosis and certification system, ensuring a personal assistant or carer, even on a 24-hour basis.

The commitment to support and give new life to culture, to protect our cultural heritage. Because culture is our soul.

Finally, the commitment to change the state, the big patient. And you know what? Only we can change this spoils state and party fiefdom that the Mitsotakis government set up all the previous years and has now enlarged with an increase in the number of post-employees and bonuses for the blue cadres. Why only us? Because we were not born and raised as princes with the notion that this state belongs to us and is at our service. We grew up with the perception that this state has only one owner: the Greek people. The Greek people own the state and they are the ones who must be served! The Greek people are the only ones who can change it.

But I want to tell you at this point, and I have said this in other meetings, that in addition to the articles of the Contract of Change, we have the legislative act ready, because justice must be speeded up. The legislative act that we will sign with the formation of the progressive government. What this act says: It says three things: Reduction of VAT on food to 6% and zero for basic foodstuffs - milk, bread, baby food.

Reduction of the Excise Duty and its abolition for farmers.

It says abolishing the Minimum Basis for Admission to Universities from these exams. Our children who are now studying should intensify their efforts because no artificial hand will cut off their access.

And it also says a suspension of all first home auctions until a new fair framework of regulation is in place. And today, citizens of Patras, Mr Mitsotakis came out to tell us that the suspension of auctions by legislative act is a constitutional absurdity. Who is saying this? He who signed dozens of legislative acts on direct awards to companies that were set up three days before these tenders were made! Who is saying this and why is he saying it? He says it because he does not like it. Because they will lose the funds, his friends won't be able to go ahead with the project, take people's homes and speculate. He says these things because he speaks as their spokesman. So we say to him, here in Patras: We will not do him any favours! We will save the property of the middle class.

They say, citizens of Patras, the programme of SYRIZA costs a lot. And they are the ones who in one year gave 10 billion in subsidies to obscenity and as many more in direct commissions. I want once again to answer them: Yes, our programme is costly: Do you know to whom? It costs the funds that will stop speculating. It costs the energy, food and fuel cartels, which will stop speculating. To the 15 listed companies on the stock exchange, which had record profits for 20 years, over 1 billion each last year, while households had no money to make in the third week of the month. Yes, it will cost them. It's going to cost the "day laborers" of direct hire, too. Did you see the panic they're in? Because they know it's going to cost them. Did you see that video of that employer threatening his workers that if they voted for Syriza they would be fired, next to the gleeful Minister of Development? So we say to them: The workers are raising their heads from Monday. The racketeers on their bench from Monday.

But I want to address young people, young people, here today from Patras, and those who will decide this election battle. And those who will judge this electoral battle are those who have always moved the wheel of history. Young people have always moved the wheel of history. They have been at the forefront of every great change in our country. Since the epic of the National Resistance. They stepped forward in '73 on the crawlers. They brought about the great change in the '80s. They stepped forward in the victory of our people in '15. They will step forward now. And I want to say to them: Young men and women have always been a force for change. I want to say to them, right now you have to choose between a government that is crushing your dreams, your hopes, and between a prospect of dreaming with justice, with dignity, of being able to live in your country. I understand that what you want most of all is to punish those who crushed your dreams in the past years. But consider this: What is the most severe, the harshest, the heaviest vote of punishment for this regime that crushed your dreams? It is the vote that will make him defeated. And how will this regime be defeated? If on Sunday Mr Mitsotakis loses. And how on Sunday will Mr Mitsotakis lose? If SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance wins and by a wide margin. If on Sunday we are in the lead and by a wide margin! So the vote of the young people for SYRIZA is the hardest punitive, the deepest anti-establishment, anti-systemic vote this Sunday.

Citizens of Patras, so my message to young people is: This Sunday we go together. Let us go together to end injustice. Let us go together to end insecurity. Let us go together to put an end to insults, to brutality, to inequality. Let's go together to throw the polls in the bucket. Let's go together to evict Mr Mitsotakis from power and the worst government of the post-revolution. Let's go to the ballot box to finally end this nightmare. That day is very close. That day will not be long in coming, as the song says. That day is coming in 48 hours. Victory Sunday is here. And with our vote, we can achieve a great victory for the people. So SYRIZA is first. But what will SYRIZA first mean? Above all, it will mean a mandate to form a progressive government the next day. Be careful, it will not be a mandate only to SYRIZA, it will be a mandate to all progressive forces, not only to SYRIZA. And it will be the mandate: Co-ordinate, take responsibility, give the people a government of change and justice.

And today, from here, from democratic Achaia, I want to call on every democratic citizen and all the forces of progress and democracy and say to them: Leave the unhistorical bipartisans and let us put an end to this nightmare for the Greeks. Come on Monday, let us seize the great opportunity of the simple proportional representation and form a government of progressive cooperation. We extend to you the hand of cooperation. Let go of the unhistorical bipartisans. With a SYRIZA victory on Monday, we will put aside our differences and move forward together to make Change a reality.

The dilemmas we all face are clear: On Sunday, we vote by simple proportional representation, but that does not mean that we do not vote by simple logic. And what does simple logic say? Simple logic says: The first to have the first say in the formation of the government. So the person who equates Syriza with New Democracy is helping New Democracy, whether he wants to or not. Those who insist on the unhistorical two-party system are helping New Democracy, whether they like it or not.

And I cannot refrain from saying it, because I am here in Patras, of the great democratic tradition, and I cannot help but address some people who even tell us that they have the exclusive legacy of the democratic tradition. Listen, I have learned one thing from this tradition, and I learned it from a great leader of the progressive party, who was born here, born in your land, in Achaia: Andreas Papandreou. Andreas Papandreou: One is the front for the Democratic Party. What? The Right. The Right is the front, there are no two fronts. So we, today, have one front. The worst right-wing government of the post-communist era, Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy.

So the possibilities that we have before us on Sunday are two, based on simple logic - with the vote of our people he will go, a few hours left, he will go!- two possibilities we have on Sunday, not many: Either we will have New Democracy and a cover-up, or Syriza and justice. Either New Democracy and family rule, or Syriza and meritocracy. Either New Democracy and the tribal state, or Syriza and the welfare state. Either New Democracy and the perpetuation of injustice, or the victory of Syriza and the return of justice. These are the two options our people have before them at the ballot box on Sunday. And all these possibilities are condensed in the end into a single dilemma. This Sunday we will go to the polls and the dilemma will be: Change or Mitsotakis again. Justice or Mitsotakis. Well, I am sure that the vast majority of the citizens of our country have already decided: SYRIZA's victory on Sunday, a progressive government on Monday and Change, Justice. They have already decided.

So I want to close today's rally, but also close two months of a campaign in which I have had the opportunity to be in almost every corner of the country, to bring you this message of hope, of victory, of optimism, and to ask you in these 48 hours to do your best to talk to the people who will decide the outcome. The people who will decide in the end, especially the young people. I close in the Patras of democratic struggles this beautiful, beautiful struggle, the struggle for change. I am closing in the Region that has honoured me, I have been a Member of Parliament for Patras and Achaia for these four years, and I ask you to realise: Change is already outside our doors, knocking on our doors. On Sunday, open the door with your vote! Today's vote has already sent you the message of victory throughout Greece. The people of Achaia today gave their own message, after yesterday's decisive message from Athens.

So I have one thing to say: The die is cast. On Sunday, SYRIZA will be the first party! On Monday we will have a progressive government. A four-year government. Stability. Prosperity for the people. Growth for the country. Security for workers and citizens. For a better Greece. Strong. Independent. Proud. Progressive. Creative. Citizens of Achaia, on Sunday evening, you can be sure that you will be celebrating again in this square. On Sunday night, it will be the people who will celebrate, not the interests. They will be celebrating the victory of SYRIZA! They will be celebrating the return of democracy to power, the return of justice.

On Sunday, I invite you to celebrate together. And on Monday, let's get to work, to wash away all that the worst government of the right has left us. Let's go hard! Let's go for it! We will change the country! Hello! Good power to the end! Strong, for the great victory! Today I was drowned by flowers, but all these days, I have been drowned by the love of the ordinary everyday man, the ordinary people. And that's the message! We will win! Because we have right on our side! We will win because we have work to do. To raise the sun of justice over Greece! Let's all go together for victory! On Sunday we will have the celebration of democracy. But let's go strong until then, to win this difficult battle! I am sure after today's rally, we will be the government on Monday! And in Achaia and Western Greece, and in all of Greece, SYRIZA is first by far! Hello!
