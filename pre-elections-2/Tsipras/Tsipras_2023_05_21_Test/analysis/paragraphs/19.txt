And I want to tell you, so that you can keep it in mind, that in the next 48 hours, to carry it everywhere, from house to house, from village to village, to every citizen, to every democratic citizen, four things that a vote for SYRIZA means this Sunday: a wage increase. A reduction in prices. A reduction in wages. And a fair, effective, strong welfare state next to the citizen. These are the four things that a vote for SYRIZA means!
