But I want to address young people, young people, here today from Patras, and those who will decide this election battle. And those who will judge this electoral battle are those who have always moved the wheel of history. Young people have always moved the wheel of history. They have been at the forefront of every great change in our country. Since the epic of the National Resistance. They stepped forward in '73 on the crawlers. They brought about the great change in the '80s. They stepped forward in the victory of our people in '15. They will step forward now. And I want to say to them: Young men and women have always been a force for change. I want to say to them, right now you have to choose between a government that is crushing your dreams, your hopes, and between a prospect of dreaming with justice, with dignity, of being able to live in your country. I understand that what you want most of all is to punish those who crushed your dreams in the past years. But consider this: What is the most severe, the harshest, the heaviest vote of punishment for this regime that crushed your dreams? It is the vote that will make him defeated. And how will this regime be defeated? If on Sunday Mr Mitsotakis loses. And how on Sunday will Mr Mitsotakis lose? If SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance wins and by a wide margin. If on Sunday we are in the lead and by a wide margin! So the vote of the young people for SYRIZA is the hardest punitive, the deepest anti-establishment, anti-systemic vote this Sunday.
