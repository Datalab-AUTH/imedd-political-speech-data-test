So the possibilities that we have before us on Sunday are two, based on simple logic - with the vote of our people he will go, a few hours left, he will go!- two possibilities we have on Sunday, not many: Either we will have New Democracy and a cover-up, or Syriza and justice. Either New Democracy and family rule, or Syriza and meritocracy. Either New Democracy and the tribal state, or Syriza and the welfare state. Either New Democracy and the perpetuation of injustice, or the victory of Syriza and the return of justice. These are the two options our people have before them at the ballot box on Sunday. And all these possibilities are condensed in the end into a single dilemma. This Sunday we will go to the polls and the dilemma will be: Change or Mitsotakis again. Justice or Mitsotakis. Well, I am sure that the vast majority of the citizens of our country have already decided: SYRIZA's victory on Sunday, a progressive government on Monday and Change, Justice. They have already decided.
