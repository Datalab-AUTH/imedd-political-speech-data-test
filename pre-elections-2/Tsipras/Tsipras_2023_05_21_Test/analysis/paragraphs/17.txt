Because we did not manage the Greek people's money to build fortunes, but we managed the last euro of the Greek citizen with responsibility and honesty. And we left behind us, in the public coffers, 37 billion as a dowry to Greece, a dowry to stability. Imagine, we had an obligation to collect 40 billion and those who shouted at us, when we were pulling the country out of the memoranda, that we were signing a fourth one, had the opportunity to spend 60. Imagine if instead of having the obligation to raise 40, we had the leeway to spend 60. Is that how Greece would be today? Is this what public hospitals would be like? Is this what the schools would be like? Would obscenity choke the income of the average household pensioner?
