So the Greek people will not forgive all that he has done in these four years. And on Sunday they will punish him, because he is unforgivable. And I am sure that those citizens who will decide at the ballot box at the last minute will think about everything they have experienced. And they will say: Enough of this nightmare. Enough of this obscenity. So much for family rule. Enough of this unworthiness. So much for indifference. So much for general injustice!
