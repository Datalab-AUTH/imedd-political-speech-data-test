Citizens of Patras, citizens of Achaia, we stand before you today, 48 hours before the polls. And we stand before you with a clean face, clean hands, but above all with a clean heart. Without a stain on our political record. We stand before you with clean hands and a clean heart, because we, under difficult circumstances, fought the battle, were tested and managed to get the country out of bankruptcy and out of the memoranda that others have thrown it into.
