On Sunday, I invite you to celebrate together. And on Monday, let's get to work, to wash away all that the worst government of the right has left us. Let's go hard! Let's go for it! We will change the country! Hello! Good power to the end! Strong, for the great victory! Today I was drowned by flowers, but all these days, I have been drowned by the love of the ordinary everyday man, the ordinary people. And that's the message! We will win! Because we have right on our side! We will win because we have work to do. To raise the sun of justice over Greece! Let's all go together for victory! On Sunday we will have the celebration of democracy. But let's go strong until then, to win this difficult battle! I am sure after today's rally, we will be the government on Monday! And in Achaia and Western Greece, and in all of Greece, SYRIZA is first by far! Hello!
