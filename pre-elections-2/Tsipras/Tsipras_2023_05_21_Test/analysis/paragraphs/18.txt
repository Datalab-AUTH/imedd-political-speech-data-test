Nobody believes that. Nobody believes it because they know that in the most difficult times we have always put the salvation of society, the salvation of the country and not the party's interests above all else. That is why today, looking the average Greek citizen in the eyes and all of you, with a clear heart, we say: We are not asking for a second chance, we are asking for a first chance to govern without memoranda, without the Troika! With our programme, on the basis of our will and not on the basis of our musts. A first chance to prove that the Left can support the weak, support the middle class, fight inequalities and create the prospect of a better Greece. We ask the Greek people to give us a first chance to govern on the basis of our programme and to approve the Contract of Change we propose by voting for SYRIZA next Sunday.
