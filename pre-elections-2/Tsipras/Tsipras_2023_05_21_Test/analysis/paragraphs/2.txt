Citizens of Achaia, today with your presence here, we are sending a message to all of Greece that we will not be terrorized by terrorists. We will terrorize them with our vote on Sunday. From here, from the castle of the great democratic party, we are standing up today against injustice, against insecurity. And we extend the hand of unity and cooperation to every democrat, every progressive citizen of our country. To those who have walked along other paths, perhaps, but always in the same direction. Towards justice, towards democracy, towards progress, towards change. And we say to them, we say to every democratic and progressive citizen today: We are not here to repeat or rewrite history. We are here to open together from Monday a new chapter in the history of our country! The chapter of change in Greece in the third decade of the 21st century. The chapter of the progressive government of cooperation that will open on Monday, after the vote of our people on Sunday. A government that will redeem the country from the worst right-wing government since the post-independence period and open the chapter of collective progress for a people who are asking for justice, for the younger generations who are hungry for better days, for a better life.
