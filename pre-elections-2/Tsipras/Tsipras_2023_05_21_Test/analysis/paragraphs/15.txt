At the same time, I am sure that traditional voters, even these, the traditional voters of New Democracy, people of morality and conscience, will ask themselves: Which distance is greater? The one that separates the left from the right, or the one that separates humanity from insensitivity? Which is the greater distance? I am sure that on Sunday the collective conscience of the Greeks will speak. A people that abhors injustice. A people that punishes arrogance. And the vast majority of our people will vote for change. It will give a vote to SYRIZA. It will give victory to SYRIZA and a strong mandate for a progressive government of cooperation, long term and stability, which will reverse the course of the country. Citizens of Achaia, shout this slogan to me the day after tomorrow night, not today! The day after tomorrow evening, when the vote of our people has evicted Mr Mitsotakis from the Maximou Mansion!
