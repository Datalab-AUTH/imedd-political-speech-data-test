We are committed to increasing spending on education. To open the doors of our universities to the tens of thousands of children who are being left out by Mr Mitsotakis, with the long arm of Mrs Kerameos, with the Minimum Admission Base. Why is he doing this? To bring patronage to the colleges. And that is immoral. And it will be stopped by these national exams. We are committed to eliminating the substitute teacher phenomenon in secondary education. To double the resources and teachers in our universities. We will hire teachers, not police officers. Police officers will go into the neighborhoods to fight crime. Because the police will also stop cooperating with the Greek Mafia. It will fight the Greek Mafia.
