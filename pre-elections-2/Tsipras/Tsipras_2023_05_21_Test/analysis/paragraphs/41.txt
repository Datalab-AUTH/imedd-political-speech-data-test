And today, from here, from democratic Achaia, I want to call on every democratic citizen and all the forces of progress and democracy and say to them: Leave the unhistorical bipartisans and let us put an end to this nightmare for the Greeks. Come on Monday, let us seize the great opportunity of the simple proportional representation and form a government of progressive cooperation. We extend to you the hand of cooperation. Let go of the unhistorical bipartisans. With a SYRIZA victory on Monday, we will put aside our differences and move forward together to make Change a reality.
