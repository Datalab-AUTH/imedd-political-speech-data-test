We do not foresee in our programme either tax increases or increases in contributions for the middle class. We do foresee tax cuts. We envisage a tax-free allowance of EUR 10 000 for self-employed people. We envisage the abolition of business tax. Reduction of VAT and fuel tax we foresee. Abolition of the VAT on agricultural and livestock oil. This is what our programme provides for. This is what we want, this is the Contract of Change that we call on the Greek people to ratify. Because we, the citizens of Patras, now have an additional reason. We have not only the political but also the moral obligation to support and give breath especially to the middle class, which was disproportionately burdened during the days of the memoranda and was brutally deceived by Mr Mitsotakis in 2019. With the Contract of Change, we are therefore making concrete and tangible commitments to the Greek people, to you.
