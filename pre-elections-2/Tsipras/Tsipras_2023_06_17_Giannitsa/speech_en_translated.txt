Thank you very much for the warm welcome that you have given me here today, citizens of Giannitsa and Pella. It is a very moving moment for me to see all of you here a week before a crucial election, giving the message 'it is allowed to fall, it is imperative to get up and fight'. We will fight until the last second, until the polls close, to overturn this correlation. We will fight not on behalf of our own party interests, but on behalf of society, which needs a strong SYRIZA, which needs to be a strong pillar of the progressive party of the country, both in the elections and the next day. And I want to commit myself to one thing here today: We will go together to fight this battle until the ballot box, resolutely strong, with optimism, and we will be together on the 25th and on the 26th. We will continue together to fight for the needs of society, to fight for the interests and rights of workers, farmers, producers, small and medium-sized professionals, for the interests of underprivileged Greeks. That is why SYRIZA was born, that is why SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is here, and that is why it will be here tomorrow. I want you to know one thing. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is not and will not be a party of protest. It is not and will not become a complement to the governmental power of our political opponents, the right. SYRIZA is and will remain a party of power. We will claim every hope, every possibility in this ballot box of June 25th, but we will be here in any case to make the progressive party with SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance as its pillar great and strong again very soon, to bring to this country perspective, hope and the change of government that is a necessity, a social necessity. I want to say to the citizens of Pella, of Giannitsa, and I would also like to say to the wider region of Pella and Edessa - I was there a few days ago - that we have decided to put the major problems facing Greek society on the agenda in this election period.

We know that this is not what our political opponents want. They have the primacy, the domination of the media. They have the ability to wage a communications war to discuss anything but the big problems.

But we want these 7 days remaining to explain to the Greek people what is at stake on June 25th. What is at stake on June 25th is who will govern the country for the next 4 years and with which program. And on June 25th, we will not vote by simple proportional representation. We are voting with the familiar old system that poses blackmailing dilemmas to citizens. This was not our choice, but this is now the system. The first one will get 50 bonus seats, let us keep that in mind. So what is at stake this Sunday is how the country will be governed and what answers will be given to the great problems of society.

The major issues facing society include income inequality, which results in households being unable to afford basic necessities such as groceries in the third week of the month. Additionally, high electricity bills are a significant drain on income. Finally, producers and farmers struggle to sustain themselves in rural areas.

The big problem has to do with the collapse of the National Health System. The public hospitals are in the worst condition since the NHS was created.

The major issues of daily life are also related to our schools and universities. The schools are filled with substitute teachers, with 30% being substitutes, and our universities lack the ability to provide young people with skills and opportunities.

The big problem has to do with the tsunami of foreclosures that will come if there is no alternative to the one that Mr. Mitsotakis and New Democracy are planning, which involves transferring mortgages to funds.

The major issue is also related to the significant challenge that young people face in obtaining a house due to skyrocketing rents.

The big problems that we experience, know, and understand have to do with the fact that an economy cannot be based on benefits and handouts. Because when those run out, we will be broke again.

These are the major issues we want to address. I know your region is an agricultural one, whose economy is based on the production of peaches, kiwi, cherries, and other quality agricultural products. I am aware of the significant challenges facing the agricultural sector, including three consecutive years of major disasters due to the climate crisis. In the spring of '21, frosts caused significant problems, reducing production by almost 50%, and ELGA compensation was non-existent. The same occurred in '22, and this year, in '23, we face a combination of challenges, including climate change, precision and accuracy issues, rising production costs, and energy costs. However, in Greece, we also have a significant gap between the price that producers receive in the field and the price that consumers pay in stores, which averages 300% and can reach 700% for products like kiwifruit. This is due to unchecked middlemen without control mechanisms, and both producers and consumers suffer as a result.

We want to provide solutions to these problems, not only for peach and cherry producers, but also for those who were unable to plant their crops due to weather conditions forcing them to reseed three times this season. We want to send a message to all of these individuals.

The New Democracy government has devalued ELGA, and agricultural production cannot proceed without risk. The state covers the risk when the farmer and producer are unable to bear it.

We had prepared a plan to change the ELGA regulation. Our plan provides for bilateral funding, meaning a doubling of the ELGA funds. The producer would pay this from their contribution, and the state budget would pay another amount, having already secured the possibility of drawing on Community funds. At the same time, we were changing the entire regulation so that it could be adapted to the new conditions of the climate crisis in order to cover the producer and the farmer.

For four years, the Mitsotakis government has left producers at the mercy of middlemen, price increases, rising energy costs, increased agro-levies, and regulations. The study for new regulations, which we left for them in '19, remains in the drawers of the Ministry of Rural Development. They even attempted to privatize ELGA, which would have been an even bigger scandal, but their proposal was rejected. However, the reality today is that ELGA is understaffed, and farmers and producers are left to their fate and at the mercy of the weather.

That is why we say supporting the producer's labor is our priority.

Reducing energy costs is also a priority for us.

Across Europe, in order to deal with this frightening energy and inflation crisis, the Commission issued a directive. What did it say? Reduce value-added tax and reduce excise duty. Only three countries in Europe have not reduced indirect taxes: Greece, Slovakia, and Malta. So why did Mr. Mitsotakis not reduce indirect taxes? What is the reason? The reason was that he wanted to increase public revenue, and he did so by plundering the vast majority of society for a year and a half now, by €6 billion. Greeks have paid €6 billion more in taxes through the maintenance of high VAT. And do not listen to those who tell you that we have not increased the rates. When the household basket goes from €50 to €100, there is no need to increase the VAT rate to increase taxes. It doubles the taxes collected by the state. When you fill up the car tank with €60 and now with €120, there is no need to increase the tax. You double the tax without increasing the rate. This plan, my friends, why was it made? Was it done to support the weak with various allowances, various passes? No. It was done so that all these allowances could be targeted to the energy cartels, the refining cartels, the supply chain cartels, to keep prices high. And we ask: what will happen when, six months from now, as the European Commission announces, the bonuses end? How will weak and middle-class households be supported? They will be left to their fate. Prices will remain high. Value-added tax will remain high, and there will be no benefits either.

And as far as farmers and producers are concerned, we say that in addition to reducing the value-added tax, the excise tax must be immediately reduced to the lowest permissible level. But especially for farmers and livestock producers, the payment of excise duty on agricultural and livestock oil should be abolished. This would mean a saving of EUR 500 per 1000 litres for the producer.

But Mr. Mitsotakis refuses to openly, civilly, and publicly discuss these positions and proposals beyond propaganda, fake news, and lies. He promised a televised debate between the two of us in the second election, but he refused. He had also promised a televised debate between the five political leaders, but he took the opportunity of the tragedy of over 600 souls to cancel it. Why doesn't he want that debate? Because he knows very well that if we get into the substance of how the country will be governed, what proposals and thoughts for the next day, he will not be able to continue creating this communicative climate that he supposedly has a plan that can lead the country boldly forward. It is not forward if the obscenity and plundering of income continues. It is not in the future that the producer, the farmer, and the cattle breeder will not be able to stay in the countryside. It is not the time for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to be threatened with the closure of their businesses.

And I want to say a few words about small and medium-sized enterprises because a lot of mud, fake news, and propaganda were thrown around in the last election. You know, I don't want to hide behind my finger against you. SYRIZA has carried on its shoulders all the burdens and all the plundering that has taken place in the public coffers since the post-war period. It found a country bankrupt with empty coffers. Who left the country bankrupt? In 2009, the government of the New Democracy party with a 15% deficit. And who left it bankrupt a second time with empty coffers? The government of Mr Samaras in 2015. We did not run away, we fought the battle. We fought the battle of negotiating with the lenders when our opponents were then shouting 'hold on, Schauble' and 'hold on, Gerun'. We have not forgotten that.

And we fought the battle to take on the burden that was not ours, to take the country out of the memoranda and bankruptcy, and we succeeded. We got the country out of the memoranda, delivered the public coffers full of 40 billion euros, and settled the public debt. That was the debt, the national debt. We honored our debt, our debt to our country. We are proud of that. In this process, we were forced to implement policies that were not our own political choices. They were the impositions of the Troika.

But every crack that we found in this tough negotiation, we used it to defend the interests of society and the public interest. I want to remind you that we were the ones who, despite having memoranda, included two and a half million uninsured citizens in the National Health System to receive healthcare.

Now there are no memoranda. The coffers are full; we left them full. Due to the pandemic, the Mitsotakis government not only had no obligation to adhere to strict fiscal rules and raise the 40 billion we were obligated to raise to get the economy and the country out of the water, but also had the freedom to spend over 60 billion to support the National Health System and the economy during the pandemic. So, the big question is what did he do? What did he do to leave behind a mound for the crises that are coming the next day, to support the welfare state, and especially the National Health System? You can see what he did with the NHS by going for a walk, passing by, or even worse - not going for a walk, wrong expression - when you are obliged to go to the public hospital because one of your own people or you yourself need hospitalization. We saw what happened with the pandemic, where at first they were celebrating that we were doing perfectly well, but in the end, we were the worst country in the whole of Europe in terms of the number of deaths as a proportion of the population, with 38,000 deaths of fellow citizens.

I want to tell you a number. In 2019, we left the NHS with six and a half thousand more permanent doctors and nurses than the NHS has today in 2023, and the pandemic has passed.

So the big and crucial question for the next day is: do we want public health or not? The answer to New Democracy's program was revealed by the cynical statements of the otherwise excellent scientist, parliamentary candidate, and New Democracy MP Mr. Pneumatikos, who revealed New Democracy's hidden agenda on health. What is this hidden plan? It was announced by Mr. Mitsotakis in the 2020 budget, but the pandemic came and covered it up. So the hidden plan is to transform hospitals into legal entities under private law. The mergers of public hospitals with private hospitals, the closure of public facilities, the shrinking - yes, the shrinking - of health spending, and finally, in the end, that is, the selection, the selection, the screening of patients. That cynical, creepy thing that Mr. Pneumatikos said is a plan. What does patient selection mean? When a patient with a low life expectancy has to get an expensive treatment, we will give it to the one who has a higher life expectancy, and the one who has a low life expectancy will do what? He will go to a private hospital. And if he can't afford it? He will be left alone and helpless.

We say that this cynicism is not worthy of our values, our culture, because our value is and will remain human life. Our value is human life, and our plan is for every citizen to have access to quality healthcare services, regardless of their financial capacity. That is why our plan is to strengthen the NHS by recruiting 15,000 doctors and nurses, making permanent those who fought on the front line of the pandemic, doubling the number of local health units, and increasing the salary of primary care doctors so that scientists stay in the National Health System, and providing better working conditions for nurses.

But I was saying that for small and medium-sized enterprises, just as for the NHS, the pandemic suspended Mitsotakis' plans for the privatization of the NHS. He will implement them now if he is elected. So, what were his plans for small and medium-sized enterprises? The Pissarides plan. Do you remember the Pissarides plan? The one that said that medium-sized businesses are zombies and should disappear to make our economy more competitive. With the pandemic, of course, he didn't implement the plan. He gave refundable advances. He will implement it now if he is elected.

In the face of this plan, which is causing small and medium-sized entrepreneurship to shrink, we are not proposing an increase in contributions, as lies have been spread through fake news and propaganda. Instead, we want debt regulation and the strengthening of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. This includes debt adjustment, as we did in '18 with the debts of traders and craftsmen to the social security funds. We propose a haircut on basic debt and 120 instalments to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, which is the backbone of the economy. Today, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and farmers cannot even get a loan from a bank branch, because systemic banks only give loans to those who can prove that they do not need them. That is why we believe that one of the greatest tools, weapons, and opportunities to be exploited in the next four years is the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. The Recovery and Resilience Fund must be redesigned, and its resources must be redistributed so that they primarily go to the region, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the rural world.

Of the loans they gave, the first 600 million from the Recovery Fund, do you know who they gave it to? Thirteen large business groups. The ones that already have loans from the central banks, but at a higher interest rate, and they gave them loans at a low interest rate, a low, non-existent 1%, so that they could make a profit on top of that. And the small and medium enterprises that need microcredit, the farmers who need microcredit for their business plans are left to their own devices.

That is why we say justice means directing the resources of the Recovery Fund to those in need. Justice means increasing resources for health, agriculture, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. Justice also means giving support to the people of creation, toil, and the underprivileged in this country. We must stop the redistribution of wealth, property, and obscenity. These are critical issues, and there is another one: the redistribution of property with the 700,000 mortgages that have gone into the funds. We will have a tsunami of foreclosures the next day. We are providing an answer, and the answer is to move to a regulatory framework that will force the funds to go to regulation and mandatory settlements. The out-of-court mechanism will be compulsory for the funds and will provide for a large part of a haircut of the nominal value of the loan. They have taken 20% of the value of the loan anyway and want to get back 100%. The participation of the state in subsidizing the installments will support not only the weak but also the middle class so that they will not lose their homes. The middle classes and the weak should not lose their professional housing or agricultural land. This is the plan of SYRIZA.

On the other hand, the plan of New Democracy says many things that will not be done and does not say many things that are intended to be done. What Mr. Mitsotakis has announced has not been included in the medium-term plan, and what Mr. Pneimatikos has said is not included and written into their program.

But I want to tell you, citizens of Pella, that in this election, which is crucial for our lives in the next four years, two alternative plans are being opposed: two plans for governance, two plans for power. The one I have described to you is that of Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy, and the alternative plan put forward by Syriza. We want to put them to the judgment of the Greek people, knowing that in this ballot box we are voting for the next day, and we are voting with tough dilemmas. It is the truth, and we are voting with tough dilemmas because one of the two will be the one that will be implemented the next day. So we will fight until the last moment to convince Greek society, to convince every Greek citizen, farmer, small and medium-sized, young and old, worker, and employee that SYRIZA's program can give breath, perspective, support, hope, and justice in this country. In any case, however, I would like to conclude by saying that what is crucial for the next day is not only whether we will be able to have a government on the 26th. What is crucial for the next day and what is crucial for every democratic citizen and, above all, for every progressive citizen, is whether our vote at the ballot box will stop an unaccountable and uncontrollable right-wing that is bringing back the worst memories of the past.

They achieved a great victory in the last election, it is true. Do you see how they are managing this victory? With arrogance, conceit, and vindictiveness. They have come out left and right and proclaim what? That their political opponents are a national exception. So they are telling us that we are citizens of diminished national and patriotic understanding, that we are traitors. In short, that is what they are saying. And I want to remind those of you who know and are familiar with the history of this country what slippery slopes such practices led to from the time of the national division of the Venizelists and anti-Venizelists who called the Venizelists traitors until much later times, the difficult times of civil strife and heartbreak, and also later on when the Right always sold Nationalism, but in difficult times, it was the one that stopped playing the rooster and played the hen when we were faced with national crises. So I want to say one thing to you here, democrat citizens of Pella: it is a shame to return to these dark days. It is a shame to play games with the country. We will not play with the homeland, but we will not tolerate anyone doing so, anyone underestimating our patriotic responsibility.

And I would like to take this opportunity to refer to the misery, the games, and the dangerous games with our national issues that Mr. Mitsotakis has been playing for a week or more with the sensitive issue of Thrace. It has been five days since it was revealed that their own candidate, Mr. Katradzi, in his statements to the Turkish media, went and spoke about the Muslim minority and said, "the Turks of Western Thrace." Those who have been criticizing us for two weeks now, that the Syriza candidates are the ones who are anti-Greek and have anti-national behavior, where are they to ask, to give an answer, to ask their candidate for a correction? Where is Mr. Mitsotakis the lariat when it comes to his own candidate? So imagine how dangerous these games are. And imagine how much Erdogan will be rubbing his hands with all that is going on these days. It is indeed a shame to give arms to Turkey by playing Turkey's games in the internal political debate.

And I really want to ask myself, who went to the Muslim minority to threaten and intimidate them and tell them that if they don't vote for New Democracy, they will have four difficult years ahead of them? Who intimidated these poor people? Remember 2012? She ran on her own and got 2.5%. In Thrace, she got 18%. In Iasmo, which is a minority, she got 60%. I wonder if Mr Mitsotakis' sister had made a deal with Erdogan or the Turkish government? It is a disgrace to say such things. But Mrs Bakoyannis did not go to intimidate the Muslim minority; she went to send a message to every social group, not just the Muslim minority. She did this in front of the camera for one reason: she wanted the intimidation to reach every home, every family, and every social group. And what is the message? That if in the next four years you are against the will of our own regime, party, and family, you will have a hard time. That was Mrs Bakoyannis' message. Today she is addressing it to the Muslim minority, but tomorrow it will concern farmers, nurses, doctors, and every social category that is likely to resist.

I want to call on every Democrat and progressive citizen who knows that there is a lot at stake in this election to unite their vote despite any reservations or disagreements they may have with SYRIZA. Let us unite our voice with theirs, and unite our voice with the power of SYRIZA. What is at stake on the next day is not whether we will or will not have a government, but whether we will have an uncontrolled and unregulated regime. The only force that can crush them is a strong Syriza. A strong Syriza means a strong society and a strong democracy. Let us fight this battle vote by vote, house by house, down to the last second. And we will be together, I pledge, on the next day, whatever the result, to keep fighting for our values, ideas, ideals, society, and underprivileged citizens. Bless you, good strength, good power, good strength, and good fights. I want to close by saying how important it is to have your man in the House on the next day. You know your man, and it is very important. We will have him, and we will be strong. Goodbye, goodbye.
