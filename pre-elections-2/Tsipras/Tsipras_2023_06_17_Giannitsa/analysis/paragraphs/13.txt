We had prepared a plan to change the ELGA regulation. Our plan provides for bilateral funding, meaning a doubling of the ELGA funds. The producer would pay this from their contribution, and the state budget would pay another amount, having already secured the possibility of drawing on Community funds. At the same time, we were changing the entire regulation so that it could be adapted to the new conditions of the climate crisis in order to cover the producer and the farmer.
