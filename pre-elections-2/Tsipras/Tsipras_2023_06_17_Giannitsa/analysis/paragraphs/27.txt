But I was saying that for small and medium-sized enterprises, just as for the NHS, the pandemic suspended Mitsotakis' plans for the privatization of the NHS. He will implement them now if he is elected. So, what were his plans for small and medium-sized enterprises? The Pissarides plan. Do you remember the Pissarides plan? The one that said that medium-sized businesses are zombies and should disappear to make our economy more competitive. With the pandemic, of course, he didn't implement the plan. He gave refundable advances. He will implement it now if he is elected.
