Of the loans they gave, the first 600 million from the Recovery Fund, do you know who they gave it to? Thirteen large business groups. The ones that already have loans from the central banks, but at a higher interest rate, and they gave them loans at a low interest rate, a low, non-existent 1%, so that they could make a profit on top of that. And the small and medium enterprises that need microcredit, the farmers who need microcredit for their business plans are left to their own devices.
