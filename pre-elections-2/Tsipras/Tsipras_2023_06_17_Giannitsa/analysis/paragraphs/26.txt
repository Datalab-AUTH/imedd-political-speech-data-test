We say that this cynicism is not worthy of our values, our culture, because our value is and will remain human life. Our value is human life, and our plan is for every citizen to have access to quality healthcare services, regardless of their financial capacity. That is why our plan is to strengthen the NHS by recruiting 15,000 doctors and nurses, making permanent those who fought on the front line of the pandemic, doubling the number of local health units, and increasing the salary of primary care doctors so that scientists stay in the National Health System, and providing better working conditions for nurses.
