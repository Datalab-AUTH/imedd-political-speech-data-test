These are the major issues we want to address. I know your region is an agricultural one, whose economy is based on the production of peaches, kiwi, cherries, and other quality agricultural products. I am aware of the significant challenges facing the agricultural sector, including three consecutive years of major disasters due to the climate crisis. In the spring of '21, frosts caused significant problems, reducing production by almost 50%, and ELGA compensation was non-existent. The same occurred in '22, and this year, in '23, we face a combination of challenges, including climate change, precision and accuracy issues, rising production costs, and energy costs. However, in Greece, we also have a significant gap between the price that producers receive in the field and the price that consumers pay in stores, which averages 300% and can reach 700% for products like kiwifruit. This is due to unchecked middlemen without control mechanisms, and both producers and consumers suffer as a result.
