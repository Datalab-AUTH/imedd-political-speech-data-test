In the face of this plan, which is causing small and medium-sized entrepreneurship to shrink, we are not proposing an increase in contributions, as lies have been spread through fake news and propaganda. Instead, we want debt regulation and the strengthening of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. This includes debt adjustment, as we did in '18 with the debts of traders and craftsmen to the social security funds. We propose a haircut on basic debt and 120 instalments to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, which is the backbone of the economy. Today, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and farmers cannot even get a loan from a bank branch, because systemic banks only give loans to those who can prove that they do not need them. That is why we believe that one of the greatest tools, weapons, and opportunities to be exploited in the next four years is the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. The Recovery and Resilience Fund must be redesigned, and its resources must be redistributed so that they primarily go to the region, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the rural world.
