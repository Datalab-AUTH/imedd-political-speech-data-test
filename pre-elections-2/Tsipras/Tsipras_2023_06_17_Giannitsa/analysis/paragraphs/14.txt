For four years, the Mitsotakis government has left producers at the mercy of middlemen, price increases, rising energy costs, increased agro-levies, and regulations. The study for new regulations, which we left for them in '19, remains in the drawers of the Ministry of Rural Development. They even attempted to privatize ELGA, which would have been an even bigger scandal, but their proposal was rejected. However, the reality today is that ELGA is understaffed, and farmers and producers are left to their fate and at the mercy of the weather.
