And I would like to take this opportunity to refer to the misery, the games, and the dangerous games with our national issues that Mr. Mitsotakis has been playing for a week or more with the sensitive issue of Thrace. It has been five days since it was revealed that their own candidate, Mr. Katradzi, in his statements to the Turkish media, went and spoke about the Muslim minority and said, "the Turks of Western Thrace." Those who have been criticizing us for two weeks now, that the Syriza candidates are the ones who are anti-Greek and have anti-national behavior, where are they to ask, to give an answer, to ask their candidate for a correction? Where is Mr. Mitsotakis the lariat when it comes to his own candidate? So imagine how dangerous these games are. And imagine how much Erdogan will be rubbing his hands with all that is going on these days. It is indeed a shame to give arms to Turkey by playing Turkey's games in the internal political debate.
