And we fought the battle to take on the burden that was not ours, to take the country out of the memoranda and bankruptcy, and we succeeded. We got the country out of the memoranda, delivered the public coffers full of 40 billion euros, and settled the public debt. That was the debt, the national debt. We honored our debt, our debt to our country. We are proud of that. In this process, we were forced to implement policies that were not our own political choices. They were the impositions of the Troika.
