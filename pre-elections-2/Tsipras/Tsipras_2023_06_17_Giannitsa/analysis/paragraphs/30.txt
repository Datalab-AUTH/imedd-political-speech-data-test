That is why we say justice means directing the resources of the Recovery Fund to those in need. Justice means increasing resources for health, agriculture, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. Justice also means giving support to the people of creation, toil, and the underprivileged in this country. We must stop the redistribution of wealth, property, and obscenity. These are critical issues, and there is another one: the redistribution of property with the 700,000 mortgages that have gone into the funds. We will have a tsunami of foreclosures the next day. We are providing an answer, and the answer is to move to a regulatory framework that will force the funds to go to regulation and mandatory settlements. The out-of-court mechanism will be compulsory for the funds and will provide for a large part of a haircut of the nominal value of the loan. They have taken 20% of the value of the loan anyway and want to get back 100%. The participation of the state in subsidizing the installments will support not only the weak but also the middle class so that they will not lose their homes. The middle classes and the weak should not lose their professional housing or agricultural land. This is the plan of SYRIZA.
