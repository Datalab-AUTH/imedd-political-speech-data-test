And I want to say a few words about small and medium-sized enterprises because a lot of mud, fake news, and propaganda were thrown around in the last election. You know, I don't want to hide behind my finger against you. SYRIZA has carried on its shoulders all the burdens and all the plundering that has taken place in the public coffers since the post-war period. It found a country bankrupt with empty coffers. Who left the country bankrupt? In 2009, the government of the New Democracy party with a 15% deficit. And who left it bankrupt a second time with empty coffers? The government of Mr Samaras in 2015. We did not run away, we fought the battle. We fought the battle of negotiating with the lenders when our opponents were then shouting 'hold on, Schauble' and 'hold on, Gerun'. We have not forgotten that.
