Thank you very much for the warm welcome that you have given me here today, citizens of Giannitsa and Pella. It is a very moving moment for me to see all of you here a week before a crucial election, giving the message 'it is allowed to fall, it is imperative to get up and fight'. We will fight until the last second, until the polls close, to overturn this correlation. We will fight not on behalf of our own party interests, but on behalf of society, which needs a strong SYRIZA, which needs to be a strong pillar of the progressive party of the country, both in the elections and the next day. And I want to commit myself to one thing here today: We will go together to fight this battle until the ballot box, resolutely strong, with optimism, and we will be together on the 25th and on the 26th. We will continue together to fight for the needs of society, to fight for the interests and rights of workers, farmers, producers, small and medium-sized professionals, for the interests of underprivileged Greeks. That is why SYRIZA was born, that is why SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is here, and that is why it will be here tomorrow. I want you to know one thing. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is not and will not be a party of protest. It is not and will not become a complement to the governmental power of our political opponents, the right. SYRIZA is and will remain a party of power. We will claim every hope, every possibility in this ballot box of June 25th, but we will be here in any case to make the progressive party with SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance as its pillar great and strong again very soon, to bring to this country perspective, hope and the change of government that is a necessity, a social necessity. I want to say to the citizens of Pella, of Giannitsa, and I would also like to say to the wider region of Pella and Edessa - I was there a few days ago - that we have decided to put the major problems facing Greek society on the agenda in this election period.
