Now there are no memoranda. The coffers are full; we left them full. Due to the pandemic, the Mitsotakis government not only had no obligation to adhere to strict fiscal rules and raise the 40 billion we were obligated to raise to get the economy and the country out of the water, but also had the freedom to spend over 60 billion to support the National Health System and the economy during the pandemic. So, the big question is what did he do? What did he do to leave behind a mound for the crises that are coming the next day, to support the welfare state, and especially the National Health System? You can see what he did with the NHS by going for a walk, passing by, or even worse - not going for a walk, wrong expression - when you are obliged to go to the public hospital because one of your own people or you yourself need hospitalization. We saw what happened with the pandemic, where at first they were celebrating that we were doing perfectly well, but in the end, we were the worst country in the whole of Europe in terms of the number of deaths as a proportion of the population, with 38,000 deaths of fellow citizens.
