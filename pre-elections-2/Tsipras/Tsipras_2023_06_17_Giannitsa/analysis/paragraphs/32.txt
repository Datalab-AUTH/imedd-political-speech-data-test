But I want to tell you, citizens of Pella, that in this election, which is crucial for our lives in the next four years, two alternative plans are being opposed: two plans for governance, two plans for power. The one I have described to you is that of Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy, and the alternative plan put forward by Syriza. We want to put them to the judgment of the Greek people, knowing that in this ballot box we are voting for the next day, and we are voting with tough dilemmas. It is the truth, and we are voting with tough dilemmas because one of the two will be the one that will be implemented the next day. So we will fight until the last moment to convince Greek society, to convince every Greek citizen, farmer, small and medium-sized, young and old, worker, and employee that SYRIZA's program can give breath, perspective, support, hope, and justice in this country. In any case, however, I would like to conclude by saying that what is crucial for the next day is not only whether we will be able to have a government on the 26th. What is crucial for the next day and what is crucial for every democratic citizen and, above all, for every progressive citizen, is whether our vote at the ballot box will stop an unaccountable and uncontrollable right-wing that is bringing back the worst memories of the past.
