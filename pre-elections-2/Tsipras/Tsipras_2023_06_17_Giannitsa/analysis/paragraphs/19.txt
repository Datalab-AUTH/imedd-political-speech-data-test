But Mr. Mitsotakis refuses to openly, civilly, and publicly discuss these positions and proposals beyond propaganda, fake news, and lies. He promised a televised debate between the two of us in the second election, but he refused. He had also promised a televised debate between the five political leaders, but he took the opportunity of the tragedy of over 600 souls to cancel it. Why doesn't he want that debate? Because he knows very well that if we get into the substance of how the country will be governed, what proposals and thoughts for the next day, he will not be able to continue creating this communicative climate that he supposedly has a plan that can lead the country boldly forward. It is not forward if the obscenity and plundering of income continues. It is not in the future that the producer, the farmer, and the cattle breeder will not be able to stay in the countryside. It is not the time for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to be threatened with the closure of their businesses.
