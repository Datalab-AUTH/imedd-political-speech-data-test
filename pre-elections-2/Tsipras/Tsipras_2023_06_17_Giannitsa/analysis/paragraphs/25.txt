So the big and crucial question for the next day is: do we want public health or not? The answer to New Democracy's program was revealed by the cynical statements of the otherwise excellent scientist, parliamentary candidate, and New Democracy MP Mr. Pneumatikos, who revealed New Democracy's hidden agenda on health. What is this hidden plan? It was announced by Mr. Mitsotakis in the 2020 budget, but the pandemic came and covered it up. So the hidden plan is to transform hospitals into legal entities under private law. The mergers of public hospitals with private hospitals, the closure of public facilities, the shrinking - yes, the shrinking - of health spending, and finally, in the end, that is, the selection, the selection, the screening of patients. That cynical, creepy thing that Mr. Pneumatikos said is a plan. What does patient selection mean? When a patient with a low life expectancy has to get an expensive treatment, we will give it to the one who has a higher life expectancy, and the one who has a low life expectancy will do what? He will go to a private hospital. And if he can't afford it? He will be left alone and helpless.
