They achieved a great victory in the last election, it is true. Do you see how they are managing this victory? With arrogance, conceit, and vindictiveness. They have come out left and right and proclaim what? That their political opponents are a national exception. So they are telling us that we are citizens of diminished national and patriotic understanding, that we are traitors. In short, that is what they are saying. And I want to remind those of you who know and are familiar with the history of this country what slippery slopes such practices led to from the time of the national division of the Venizelists and anti-Venizelists who called the Venizelists traitors until much later times, the difficult times of civil strife and heartbreak, and also later on when the Right always sold Nationalism, but in difficult times, it was the one that stopped playing the rooster and played the hen when we were faced with national crises. So I want to say one thing to you here, democrat citizens of Pella: it is a shame to return to these dark days. It is a shame to play games with the country. We will not play with the homeland, but we will not tolerate anyone doing so, anyone underestimating our patriotic responsibility.
