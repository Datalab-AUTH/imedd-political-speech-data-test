And I really want to ask myself, who went to the Muslim minority to threaten and intimidate them and tell them that if they don't vote for New Democracy, they will have four difficult years ahead of them? Who intimidated these poor people? Remember 2012? She ran on her own and got 2.5%. In Thrace, she got 18%. In Iasmo, which is a minority, she got 60%. I wonder if Mr Mitsotakis' sister had made a deal with Erdogan or the Turkish government? It is a disgrace to say such things. But Mrs Bakoyannis did not go to intimidate the Muslim minority; she went to send a message to every social group, not just the Muslim minority. She did this in front of the camera for one reason: she wanted the intimidation to reach every home, every family, and every social group. And what is the message? That if in the next four years you are against the will of our own regime, party, and family, you will have a hard time. That was Mrs Bakoyannis' message. Today she is addressing it to the Muslim minority, but tomorrow it will concern farmers, nurses, doctors, and every social category that is likely to resist.
