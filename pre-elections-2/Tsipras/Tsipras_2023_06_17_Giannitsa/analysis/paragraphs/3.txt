But we want these 7 days remaining to explain to the Greek people what is at stake on June 25th. What is at stake on June 25th is who will govern the country for the next 4 years and with which program. And on June 25th, we will not vote by simple proportional representation. We are voting with the familiar old system that poses blackmailing dilemmas to citizens. This was not our choice, but this is now the system. The first one will get 50 bonus seats, let us keep that in mind. So what is at stake this Sunday is how the country will be governed and what answers will be given to the great problems of society.
