Across Europe, in order to deal with this frightening energy and inflation crisis, the Commission issued a directive. What did it say? Reduce value-added tax and reduce excise duty. Only three countries in Europe have not reduced indirect taxes: Greece, Slovakia, and Malta. So why did Mr. Mitsotakis not reduce indirect taxes? What is the reason? The reason was that he wanted to increase public revenue, and he did so by plundering the vast majority of society for a year and a half now, by €6 billion. Greeks have paid €6 billion more in taxes through the maintenance of high VAT. And do not listen to those who tell you that we have not increased the rates. When the household basket goes from €50 to €100, there is no need to increase the VAT rate to increase taxes. It doubles the taxes collected by the state. When you fill up the car tank with €60 and now with €120, there is no need to increase the tax. You double the tax without increasing the rate. This plan, my friends, why was it made? Was it done to support the weak with various allowances, various passes? No. It was done so that all these allowances could be targeted to the energy cartels, the refining cartels, the supply chain cartels, to keep prices high. And we ask: what will happen when, six months from now, as the European Commission announces, the bonuses end? How will weak and middle-class households be supported? They will be left to their fate. Prices will remain high. Value-added tax will remain high, and there will be no benefits either.
