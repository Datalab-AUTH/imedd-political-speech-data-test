I want to call on every Democrat and progressive citizen who knows that there is a lot at stake in this election to unite their vote despite any reservations or disagreements they may have with SYRIZA. Let us unite our voice with theirs, and unite our voice with the power of SYRIZA. What is at stake on the next day is not whether we will or will not have a government, but whether we will have an uncontrolled and unregulated regime. The only force that can crush them is a strong Syriza. A strong Syriza means a strong society and a strong democracy. Let us fight this battle vote by vote, house by house, down to the last second. And we will be together, I pledge, on the next day, whatever the result, to keep fighting for our values, ideas, ideals, society, and underprivileged citizens. Bless you, good strength, good power, good strength, and good fights. I want to close by saying how important it is to have your man in the House on the next day. You know your man, and it is very important. We will have him, and we will be strong. Goodbye, goodbye.
