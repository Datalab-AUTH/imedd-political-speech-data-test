Greece had the highest number of deaths in proportion to its population in Europe during the pandemic. Why did this occur? Was it due to bad luck? Was it because of the country's poor condition, as young people were saying three months ago when two trains ran on the same line for 12 minutes, resulting in 57 lost lives? No, it is not due to the country being bad. It is due to the intentional devaluation of all public infrastructure for the benefit of speculation.
