However, these days, the masks have been dropped in relation to the big, critical, and crucial issue that concerns the life and perspective of almost the whole of Greek society. All the underprivileged who have public hospitals and the national health system as their only recourse when something happens to us. Within three days, three incidents occurred. A 63-year-old woman died in the back of a rural car in Kos because there was no ambulance to pick her up. A 19-year-old pregnant woman in New Makri suffered the same fate. She and her child expired because it took five hours for the ambulance to pick her up. A 60-year-old tourist in Halkidiki also experienced the same. We are experiencing days of total collapse of public hospitals and the national health system, and this was not a compulsion, as during the Troika period. This was a choice.
