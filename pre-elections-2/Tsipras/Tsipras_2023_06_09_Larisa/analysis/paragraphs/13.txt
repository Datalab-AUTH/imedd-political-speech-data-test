And why did all this happen? Did they not have the financial means to hire rescuers? Obviously, they did, but they don't care about public health. They have a plan to privatize it, to make health care a commodity, an object of speculation, of funds, and big speculative interests. Greece has ended up being the country with the highest rate of private spending on health, 35% private spending, when the European average is 15%. Greece is the country that has 2 times less public spending per capita on health care than the European average. Why is this the case? To leave a huge scope for speculation for private interests? Because that is the strategy of Mr Mitsotakis's neoliberal New Democracy, as was the strategy of the International Monetary Fund.
