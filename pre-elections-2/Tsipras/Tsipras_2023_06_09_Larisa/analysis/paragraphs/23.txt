So we are telling Greek citizens that these are the critical stakes of the June 25th election. And you know what? Mr. Mitsotakis says the ballot box will be empty. We are not just saying that the ballot box will be empty. We are saying something even more important: that this ballot box will be held on different terms. This is not a ballot box of proportional representation. This is a ballot box of enhanced proportional representation. We recognize that we have defended our values and our vision to change the political system. We have defended our values and our vision for there to be parity of vote, but also for the possibility of making it happen in the country. It is a multi-generational vision of working together on a programmatic basis of all progressive forces in the country. Unfortunately, we missed it. It was an illusion because other progressive forces, while we were giving them the hand of cooperation to see how to govern and how to defeat the right, instead of having the right as their front, they had us as their front. While we were giving them the hand, they wanted to cut off our hand. We were looking at the future of the country, and they were looking at how to grow their own in the field. These responsibilities? At some point in history, history will assign them. No doubt about it.
