So today, since you are giving us courage with your presence, I want to give you confidence, strength, and faith in a victorious result in the elections on the twentieth Thursday of June. We will not stop fighting for a minute. We will not stop for a minute to highlight our proposal, our right, the rightness of our proposals and our positions. We will not stop for a minute, and my promise is one. We will not stop, and we will be together in the next day to fight our battles, our battle for society, our battle for the people, our battle for the peasantry, for the working class. We will be the support, the pillar of the people and the working class of the young people. At one time, a great philosopher, Althusser said, "the future lasts a long time." Be armed for that future. The future is not judged. In a moment, we will be strong, even stronger, because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and we will win because we are right. We will win. I invite you in these 15 days to fight this fight, not to lose a second. The reversal of the correlations is possible if we believe in it first. Let us fight the fight and convince the people around us to go to the ballot box with determination and optimism. The story will not end so easily. Lost races are races that are not fought, and we are determined to fight and win this race. Be well. Thank you very much for your presence, for your strength. Be well, good strength, good strength, good health! Thank you!
