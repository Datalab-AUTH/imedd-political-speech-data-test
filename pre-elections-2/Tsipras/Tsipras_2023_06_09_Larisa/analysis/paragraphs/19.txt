These are the crucial dilemmas of the ballot box. Today, we have revealed both the obvious and the hidden plan of New Democracy. We have revealed that their program says many things that they do not intend to do because they have not declared them in Europe. It does not say other things that they intend to do, such as tax exemptions and wage increases that they will never do. It does not say anything about the dismantling of the cynical plan to dismantle the national health system, which they intend to do. It's not just the national health system; public health is one of the critical issues that affect people's lives. It's critical that we debate the June 25 ballot box and the big issue of income looting and income-eating inefficiency.
