So I want to tell you, and those who have false hopes, that the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is not a flare, but rather the mature child of the needs of Greek society and its people. It came to support the popular strata, the working class, the wage-earners, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the people of toil and creation, the producers, and the people of culture, and it will continue to support them. We know that we are fighting a difficult but crucial struggle this time. We had a negative result, but we have a ballot box in front of us that will decide the lives of the citizens of our country for the next four years. This time, we want to concentrate the political debate on the conflicting programs and the major problems that concern the present and future of Greek society. We are voting for our lives because our lives are at stake. Throughout the previous period, they tried and succeeded, perhaps with our responsibility, to divert the debate to yesterday and talk about anything else, rather than everything we have experienced in these four years.
