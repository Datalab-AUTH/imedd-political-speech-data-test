SYRIZA, the progressive alliance, is the only one that has an alternative plan of governance and program to that of New Democracy. The KKE is not interested in an alternative plan of governance. It says they are all the same - those who cut labor rights, reduce wages, dismantle the eight-hour working day, and impose unpaid overtime. The same as we who want a labor inspectorate, collective agreements, wage increases, and labor regularity. They don't care; they say so be it.
