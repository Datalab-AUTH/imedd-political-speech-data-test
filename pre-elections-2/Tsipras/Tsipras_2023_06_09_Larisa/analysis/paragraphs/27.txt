The pillar of the progressive party of the country. The main opponent of the right and its politicians. That is why in this battle we will fight to the last second to win, to achieve a victorious result. That is our goal. However, I must note that this is an enhanced proportional representation election, which means that the first party will receive 50 bonus seats. If New Democracy comes in first, they will be able to implement their program independently unless the May correlation is overturned by a coalition of parties. This would have a very negative impact on society and democracy.
