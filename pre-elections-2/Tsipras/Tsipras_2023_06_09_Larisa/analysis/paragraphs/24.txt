But I want to tell you something. This ballot box is not a simple proportional representation ballot box. What has happened is that this ballot is again a ballot of enhanced proportional representation, that is, as we had learned in all the previous years. What does that mean? 50 bonus seats to the first. So what does it mean? It means that at this moment, two opposing plans are in crisis with the Greek people. The plan of the New Democracy, which wants to continue this policy of plundering income, plundering society for the benefit of obscenity and profitability, privatization of health, energy, and even water in education, and on the other hand, the plan of Syriza.
