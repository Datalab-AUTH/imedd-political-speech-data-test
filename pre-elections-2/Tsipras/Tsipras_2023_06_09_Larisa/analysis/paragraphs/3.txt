The same people who left the public coffers empty in '15 so that we could not pay the pensions. Those who are supposed to be excellent technocrats owe the banks 400 million euros in loans and unpaid loans. They criticized us who, down to the last euro, took care to safeguard and left almost 40 billion euros in the public coffers that no other government has taken care to leave paved for the country, for society, for the economy.
