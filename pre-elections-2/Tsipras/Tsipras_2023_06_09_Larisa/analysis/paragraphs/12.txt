Despite having a knife at our throats, we were obliged to collect every last euro to get the country out of bankruptcy. Nonetheless, we ensured that we recruited over 300 rescuers and had 84 ambulances operating daily in the Attica basin during our time in government. Despite having no commitment to budgetary restrictions, they did not make a single recruitment during those four years. Instead, 560 rescuers left the EKAB. As a result, while 84 ambulances were operating during our time, only 52 are operating today. In Kos, where the incident took place, we had 2 shifts in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 1 in the evening. Today, they only have 1 shift in the morning, noon, and evening because the number of rescuers has decreased from 16 to 8.
