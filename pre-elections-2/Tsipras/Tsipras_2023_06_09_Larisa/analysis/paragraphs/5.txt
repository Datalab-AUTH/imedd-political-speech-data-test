And when we presented the dilemma to Mr. Mitsotakis, who spoke about overspending to conceal the essence of our program, shall we go together to the General Accounting Office of the State or to the House Budget Committee? Let's cost our programs and come back the next day to have an open discussion in a public TV debate. Once again, he ran away, and do you know why he ran away? Because the program of the New Democracy is a fraudulent program. Governments' programs are what are submitted to the European Commission as medium-term programs for the next three years. Just two months ago, the New Democracy, as a government, submitted its program to the European Commission, the medium-term program for the next three years. Do you know which of the measures announced by Mr. Mitsotakis have been included in the medium-term? Only one. Only one. None of his announcements have been included in the medium-term. The actual program of the New Democracy does not provide for benefits, tax cuts, or wage increases.
