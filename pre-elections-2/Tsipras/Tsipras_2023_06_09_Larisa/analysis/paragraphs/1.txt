I want to thank you for the warm welcome. I want to thank you for your passion and determination. Before I begin my address here in Larissa today, I want to say one thing. Your presence, passion, and message today are more important than at any other time. SYRIZA is here to stay and will stand with the struggles of the citizens of the Greek people's society. We will always be together on the ramparts, in the struggles. It is imperative to get up when you fall, and we are standing up.
