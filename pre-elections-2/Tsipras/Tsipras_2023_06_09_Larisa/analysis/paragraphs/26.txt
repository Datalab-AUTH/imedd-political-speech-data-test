On the other hand, what does PASOK-KINAL tell us? It tells us that we are not interested in progressive governance. During the election campaign, it told us that we could cooperate with New Democracy. We are interested in one thing: what should we become in place of SYRIZA? You don't easily become SYRIZA in place of SYRIZA because SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is a party that has been expressing social needs for a decade. It is not a complement to the right. SYRIZA will not become a complement to the right. It is and will remain a protest party, a power party, and it will claim until the last second to overturn the correlations. Are we not interested in becoming a complement to the right, as they once were to get Mr. Samaras as prime minister? We are not forgetting this. We are interested in being here.
