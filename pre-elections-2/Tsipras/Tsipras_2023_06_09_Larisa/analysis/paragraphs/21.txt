We have a plan to end the super-profits mechanism by taxing and capping them. The price of gas and electricity will be capped, and the profit rate will be limited to 5%. Our program is costed and designed to support the weak and middle class, with main features including increased wages and income, reduced prices through lower indirect taxation, and debt regulation.
