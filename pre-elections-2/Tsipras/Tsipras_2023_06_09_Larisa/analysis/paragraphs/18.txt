So we want to address the Greek people and say to all citizens, do we want our hospitals to be in an even worse state tomorrow than they are today? Do we want citizens who cannot afford it to be deprived of healthcare? Consider, consider what is the line, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund and of the New Democracy, which accused Syriza of having a plan to reduce - increase, excuse me - insurance contributions. Who are those who, a few days later, it turned out have left farmers and freelancers who do not have to pay â‚¬720? So the whole of one year's contributions outside the services of the National Health Insurance Fund, outside healthcare, and they blame us who, during the period of the memoranda, had put two and a half million uninsured people into the health system, giving them healthcare.
