For 2 years now, while they say they are not raising taxes, they have in fact plundered the middle class and the weak through the value-added tax. When the household basket has gone up 2 times over, then the tax paid by the citizen through VAT goes up 2 times over. There is no need for the rate to go up as long as it remains the same. When you used to pay €50 to fill up your car's tank and now you pay €100, the tax you pay doubles. Without going up the rates, the biggest tax looting that has happened is that of the last 16 months. 6 billion euros more in taxes have been paid by the Greek citizen by keeping VAT and excise tax high. Why is this happening? Have you asked yourself? This is so that there is revenue in the public coffers and subsidies are given, but not to meet the needs of the consumer, but to go to energy companies, refining companies, supermarket companies, in a directed and targeted manner. Why do they go there so that they can keep prices high? That's how the huge profits, the super profits are created.
