We have honestly managed the greatest difficulties of the Greek people, and we are proud of what we have achieved. We have fulfilled our debt to history by keeping the country in Europe through our decisions. However, they are taking the country away from Europe with their decisions. The dilemma today is not whether we will stay in Europe, but whether we will become Europe. When a country is moving away from the European average in terms of income, labor relations, social infrastructure, the welfare state, and the rule of law, it is on a path of divergence. Therefore, we are here today to openly discuss the major problems facing Greek society in the 15 days left until the crucial June ballot.
