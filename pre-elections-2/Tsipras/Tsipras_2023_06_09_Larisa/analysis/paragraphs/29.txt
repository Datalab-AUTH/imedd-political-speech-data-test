We call on progressive citizens, despite any disagreements or reservations they may have with us during these 15 days, to seriously consider supporting the only reliable force with their vote on June 25th. The stronger this force is, the greater the hopes for citizens, society, and the people - whether it be hopes of reversing the current correlation and winning, or simply the hope that there will be someone the next day who can hold Mr. Mitsotakis and the New Democracy accountable and prevent the implementation of an unpopular and anti-social program.
