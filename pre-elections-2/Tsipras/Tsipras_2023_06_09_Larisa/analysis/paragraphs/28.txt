Today, I want to address all progressive citizens who do not want a system of political instability and a non-functioning democracy. Those who have decided not to vote for Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy. Objectively speaking, with the system of enhanced proportional representation, every vote that does not go to New Democracy but is not directed to SYRIZA's ballot box is a vote that reinforces New Democracy's plan to be self-reliant, all-powerful, and to proceed with its plan of social plunder.
