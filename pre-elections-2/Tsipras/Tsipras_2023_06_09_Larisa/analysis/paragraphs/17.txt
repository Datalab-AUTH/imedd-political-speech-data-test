Be careful, this is not an unfortunate statement, this is not a bad moment. During the budget debate in December 2019, Mr Mitsotakis told us that the pandemic had not yet arrived and that we would shudder with our public health program. When we asked why we would cringe and what he wanted to do, he answered that they were going to pilot public-private partnerships with three major hospitals because that was their plan. This is what they were saying during the election, and we just didn't read their program very well. So what is different? Did Mr Pneimatikos say something different from the program and plan of New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis? He did not say anything different, he just said it a little more sloppily about people with chronic diseases and cancer patients, and this statement could not be collected. However, 24 hours passed before they decided to take him off the ballot. They decided to do so after we asked them to make this move to make it clear that it is not their secret agenda. "Too late, too little" as the Anglo-Saxons say. Mr Pneimatikos revealed the real plan, the secret agenda of New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis on healthcare, but it was too little, too late.
