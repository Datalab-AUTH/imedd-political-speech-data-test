The New Democracy MP and candidate for re-election, who is an otherwise excellent scientist, came to reveal the hidden agenda. I am referring to what Mr. Pneimatikos said the day before yesterday. He said that the state cannot spend money on public health because healthcare is expensive. He also said that hospitals should become legal entities under private law, with managers in place. Since the state will not spend, they should find their own resources through partnerships with private entities. When there are people with poor prognosis, heavy cases, or cancer patients who have no long life expectancy, they should go to private hospitals. Otherwise, they should go home and wait for the fatality.
