I want to thank you for the warm welcome. I want to thank you for your passion and determination. Before I begin my address here in Larissa today, I want to say one thing. Your presence, passion, and message today are more important than at any other time. SYRIZA is here to stay and will stand with the struggles of the citizens of the Greek people's society. We will always be together on the ramparts, in the struggles. It is imperative to get up when you fall, and we are standing up.

So I want to tell you, and those who have false hopes, that the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is not a flare, but rather the mature child of the needs of Greek society and its people. It came to support the popular strata, the working class, the wage-earners, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the people of toil and creation, the producers, and the people of culture, and it will continue to support them. We know that we are fighting a difficult but crucial struggle this time. We had a negative result, but we have a ballot box in front of us that will decide the lives of the citizens of our country for the next four years. This time, we want to concentrate the political debate on the conflicting programs and the major problems that concern the present and future of Greek society. We are voting for our lives because our lives are at stake. Throughout the previous period, they tried and succeeded, perhaps with our responsibility, to divert the debate to yesterday and talk about anything else, rather than everything we have experienced in these four years.

And in the previous period, we were told that our program was not costed. Who told us that? Those who left the country in 2009 with a 15% deficit and led it into bankruptcy. The same people who left the public coffers empty in '15 so that we could not pay the pensions. Those who are supposed to be excellent technocrats owe the banks 400 million euros in loans and unpaid loans. They criticized us who, down to the last euro, took care to safeguard and left almost 40 billion euros in the public coffers that no other government has taken care to leave paved for the country, for society, for the economy.

We have honestly managed the greatest difficulties of the Greek people, and we are proud of what we have achieved. We have fulfilled our debt to history by keeping the country in Europe through our decisions. However, they are taking the country away from Europe with their decisions. The dilemma today is not whether we will stay in Europe, but whether we will become Europe. When a country is moving away from the European average in terms of income, labor relations, social infrastructure, the welfare state, and the rule of law, it is on a path of divergence. Therefore, we are here today to openly discuss the major problems facing Greek society in the 15 days left until the crucial June ballot.

And when we presented the dilemma to Mr. Mitsotakis, who spoke about overspending to conceal the essence of our program, shall we go together to the General Accounting Office of the State or to the House Budget Committee? Let's cost our programs and come back the next day to have an open discussion in a public TV debate. Once again, he ran away, and do you know why he ran away? Because the program of the New Democracy is a fraudulent program. Governments' programs are what are submitted to the European Commission as medium-term programs for the next three years. Just two months ago, the New Democracy, as a government, submitted its program to the European Commission, the medium-term program for the next three years. Do you know which of the measures announced by Mr. Mitsotakis have been included in the medium-term? Only one. Only one. None of his announcements have been included in the medium-term. The actual program of the New Democracy does not provide for benefits, tax cuts, or wage increases.

The actual program of New Democracy envisions an even greater dismantling of the national healthcare system.

Even greater dismantling of the welfare state.

Even greater precision and income cuts. Civil servants' salaries will be reduced by 700 million euros in real terms over the next three years.

1.3 billion less in primary public spending, which means less money for schools and hospitals.

And as far as the private sector wage is concerned, false hopes and false promises of â‚¬1500 in 2027 for the average wage. The increase in the real wage will be 1.4%, virtually zero. But how else could it be when Greece was the only country, according to OECD data, which had a decrease in the nominal average wage in the three years from 2019 to 2021? How else could it be when, even in the year when everyone increased the nominal wage in 2022-23, Greece was one of only three countries in Europe that had a decrease in the average real wage? This is the truth and this is the reality.

However, these days, the masks have been dropped in relation to the big, critical, and crucial issue that concerns the life and perspective of almost the whole of Greek society. All the underprivileged who have public hospitals and the national health system as their only recourse when something happens to us. Within three days, three incidents occurred. A 63-year-old woman died in the back of a rural car in Kos because there was no ambulance to pick her up. A 19-year-old pregnant woman in New Makri suffered the same fate. She and her child expired because it took five hours for the ambulance to pick her up. A 60-year-old tourist in Halkidiki also experienced the same. We are experiencing days of total collapse of public hospitals and the national health system, and this was not a compulsion, as during the Troika period. This was a choice.

Despite having a knife at our throats, we were obliged to collect every last euro to get the country out of bankruptcy. Nonetheless, we ensured that we recruited over 300 rescuers and had 84 ambulances operating daily in the Attica basin during our time in government. Despite having no commitment to budgetary restrictions, they did not make a single recruitment during those four years. Instead, 560 rescuers left the EKAB. As a result, while 84 ambulances were operating during our time, only 52 are operating today. In Kos, where the incident took place, we had 2 shifts in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 1 in the evening. Today, they only have 1 shift in the morning, noon, and evening because the number of rescuers has decreased from 16 to 8.

And why did all this happen? Did they not have the financial means to hire rescuers? Obviously, they did, but they don't care about public health. They have a plan to privatize it, to make health care a commodity, an object of speculation, of funds, and big speculative interests. Greece has ended up being the country with the highest rate of private spending on health, 35% private spending, when the European average is 15%. Greece is the country that has 2 times less public spending per capita on health care than the European average. Why is this the case? To leave a huge scope for speculation for private interests? Because that is the strategy of Mr Mitsotakis's neoliberal New Democracy, as was the strategy of the International Monetary Fund.

And I also want to give you another number, so that you can realize what has happened in the National Health System in the last four years. In December 2019, there were 108,000 permanent auxiliary contractors, doctors, nurses, and administrative staff serving in the national health system. Six months ago, in December 2022, this number had decreased to 84,000 people. Even though we went through a pandemic and everyone said that we must finally support the National Health System, why did this happen?

Greece had the highest number of deaths in proportion to its population in Europe during the pandemic. Why did this occur? Was it due to bad luck? Was it because of the country's poor condition, as young people were saying three months ago when two trains ran on the same line for 12 minutes, resulting in 57 lost lives? No, it is not due to the country being bad. It is due to the intentional devaluation of all public infrastructure for the benefit of speculation.

The New Democracy MP and candidate for re-election, who is an otherwise excellent scientist, came to reveal the hidden agenda. I am referring to what Mr. Pneimatikos said the day before yesterday. He said that the state cannot spend money on public health because healthcare is expensive. He also said that hospitals should become legal entities under private law, with managers in place. Since the state will not spend, they should find their own resources through partnerships with private entities. When there are people with poor prognosis, heavy cases, or cancer patients who have no long life expectancy, they should go to private hospitals. Otherwise, they should go home and wait for the fatality.

Be careful, this is not an unfortunate statement, this is not a bad moment. During the budget debate in December 2019, Mr Mitsotakis told us that the pandemic had not yet arrived and that we would shudder with our public health program. When we asked why we would cringe and what he wanted to do, he answered that they were going to pilot public-private partnerships with three major hospitals because that was their plan. This is what they were saying during the election, and we just didn't read their program very well. So what is different? Did Mr Pneimatikos say something different from the program and plan of New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis? He did not say anything different, he just said it a little more sloppily about people with chronic diseases and cancer patients, and this statement could not be collected. However, 24 hours passed before they decided to take him off the ballot. They decided to do so after we asked them to make this move to make it clear that it is not their secret agenda. "Too late, too little" as the Anglo-Saxons say. Mr Pneimatikos revealed the real plan, the secret agenda of New Democracy and Kyriakos Mitsotakis on healthcare, but it was too little, too late.

So we want to address the Greek people and say to all citizens, do we want our hospitals to be in an even worse state tomorrow than they are today? Do we want citizens who cannot afford it to be deprived of healthcare? Consider, consider what is the line, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund and of the New Democracy, which accused Syriza of having a plan to reduce - increase, excuse me - insurance contributions. Who are those who, a few days later, it turned out have left farmers and freelancers who do not have to pay â‚¬720? So the whole of one year's contributions outside the services of the National Health Insurance Fund, outside healthcare, and they blame us who, during the period of the memoranda, had put two and a half million uninsured people into the health system, giving them healthcare.

These are the crucial dilemmas of the ballot box. Today, we have revealed both the obvious and the hidden plan of New Democracy. We have revealed that their program says many things that they do not intend to do because they have not declared them in Europe. It does not say other things that they intend to do, such as tax exemptions and wage increases that they will never do. It does not say anything about the dismantling of the cynical plan to dismantle the national health system, which they intend to do. It's not just the national health system; public health is one of the critical issues that affect people's lives. It's critical that we debate the June 25 ballot box and the big issue of income looting and income-eating inefficiency.

For 2 years now, while they say they are not raising taxes, they have in fact plundered the middle class and the weak through the value-added tax. When the household basket has gone up 2 times over, then the tax paid by the citizen through VAT goes up 2 times over. There is no need for the rate to go up as long as it remains the same. When you used to pay â‚¬50 to fill up your car's tank and now you pay â‚¬100, the tax you pay doubles. Without going up the rates, the biggest tax looting that has happened is that of the last 16 months. 6 billion euros more in taxes have been paid by the Greek citizen by keeping VAT and excise tax high. Why is this happening? Have you asked yourself? This is so that there is revenue in the public coffers and subsidies are given, but not to meet the needs of the consumer, but to go to energy companies, refining companies, supermarket companies, in a directed and targeted manner. Why do they go there so that they can keep prices high? That's how the huge profits, the super profits are created.

We have a plan to end the super-profits mechanism by taxing and capping them. The price of gas and electricity will be capped, and the profit rate will be limited to 5%. Our program is costed and designed to support the weak and middle class, with main features including increased wages and income, reduced prices through lower indirect taxation, and debt regulation.

If the greatest redistribution of income has been through indirect taxation and benefits targeted to keep prices high in the energy, refining, and supermarket cartels, the greatest redistribution of wealth will be through the tsunami of foreclosures that is imminent in the next few months, as 700,000 mortgages have been passed from banks to funds.

So we are telling Greek citizens that these are the critical stakes of the June 25th election. And you know what? Mr. Mitsotakis says the ballot box will be empty. We are not just saying that the ballot box will be empty. We are saying something even more important: that this ballot box will be held on different terms. This is not a ballot box of proportional representation. This is a ballot box of enhanced proportional representation. We recognize that we have defended our values and our vision to change the political system. We have defended our values and our vision for there to be parity of vote, but also for the possibility of making it happen in the country. It is a multi-generational vision of working together on a programmatic basis of all progressive forces in the country. Unfortunately, we missed it. It was an illusion because other progressive forces, while we were giving them the hand of cooperation to see how to govern and how to defeat the right, instead of having the right as their front, they had us as their front. While we were giving them the hand, they wanted to cut off our hand. We were looking at the future of the country, and they were looking at how to grow their own in the field. These responsibilities? At some point in history, history will assign them. No doubt about it.

But I want to tell you something. This ballot box is not a simple proportional representation ballot box. What has happened is that this ballot is again a ballot of enhanced proportional representation, that is, as we had learned in all the previous years. What does that mean? 50 bonus seats to the first. So what does it mean? It means that at this moment, two opposing plans are in crisis with the Greek people. The plan of the New Democracy, which wants to continue this policy of plundering income, plundering society for the benefit of obscenity and profitability, privatization of health, energy, and even water in education, and on the other hand, the plan of Syriza.

SYRIZA, the progressive alliance, is the only one that has an alternative plan of governance and program to that of New Democracy. The KKE is not interested in an alternative plan of governance. It says they are all the same - those who cut labor rights, reduce wages, dismantle the eight-hour working day, and impose unpaid overtime. The same as we who want a labor inspectorate, collective agreements, wage increases, and labor regularity. They don't care; they say so be it.

On the other hand, what does PASOK-KINAL tell us? It tells us that we are not interested in progressive governance. During the election campaign, it told us that we could cooperate with New Democracy. We are interested in one thing: what should we become in place of SYRIZA? You don't easily become SYRIZA in place of SYRIZA because SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is a party that has been expressing social needs for a decade. It is not a complement to the right. SYRIZA will not become a complement to the right. It is and will remain a protest party, a power party, and it will claim until the last second to overturn the correlations. Are we not interested in becoming a complement to the right, as they once were to get Mr. Samaras as prime minister? We are not forgetting this. We are interested in being here.

The pillar of the progressive party of the country. The main opponent of the right and its politicians. That is why in this battle we will fight to the last second to win, to achieve a victorious result. That is our goal. However, I must note that this is an enhanced proportional representation election, which means that the first party will receive 50 bonus seats. If New Democracy comes in first, they will be able to implement their program independently unless the May correlation is overturned by a coalition of parties. This would have a very negative impact on society and democracy.

Today, I want to address all progressive citizens who do not want a system of political instability and a non-functioning democracy. Those who have decided not to vote for Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy. Objectively speaking, with the system of enhanced proportional representation, every vote that does not go to New Democracy but is not directed to SYRIZA's ballot box is a vote that reinforces New Democracy's plan to be self-reliant, all-powerful, and to proceed with its plan of social plunder.

We call on progressive citizens, despite any disagreements or reservations they may have with us during these 15 days, to seriously consider supporting the only reliable force with their vote on June 25th. The stronger this force is, the greater the hopes for citizens, society, and the people - whether it be hopes of reversing the current correlation and winning, or simply the hope that there will be someone the next day who can hold Mr. Mitsotakis and the New Democracy accountable and prevent the implementation of an unpopular and anti-social program.

So today, since you are giving us courage with your presence, I want to give you confidence, strength, and faith in a victorious result in the elections on the twentieth Thursday of June. We will not stop fighting for a minute. We will not stop for a minute to highlight our proposal, our right, the rightness of our proposals and our positions. We will not stop for a minute, and my promise is one. We will not stop, and we will be together in the next day to fight our battles, our battle for society, our battle for the people, our battle for the peasantry, for the working class. We will be the support, the pillar of the people and the working class of the young people. At one time, a great philosopher, Althusser said, "the future lasts a long time." Be armed for that future. The future is not judged. In a moment, we will be strong, even stronger, because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and we will win because we are right. We will win. I invite you in these 15 days to fight this fight, not to lose a second. The reversal of the correlations is possible if we believe in it first. Let us fight the fight and convince the people around us to go to the ballot box with determination and optimism. The story will not end so easily. Lost races are races that are not fought, and we are determined to fight and win this race. Be well. Thank you very much for your presence, for your strength. Be well, good strength, good strength, good health! Thank you!
