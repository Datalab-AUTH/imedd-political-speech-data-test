Citizens of Ioannina, friends, your presence here today sends a message of determination and uncompromising struggle. I want to begin this speech by committing to you that we are and will be here, and we will fight together until Sunday, until the ballot box, until the last second. We have learned in our lives and in our history, in our journey, not to give up the fight. We have learned not to give up; we have learned to fight to overturn results. So we will fight this battle until the last minute for the big upset. We will fight together until the polls on the 25th, but I pledge to you that we will be together on the 26th. Together, we will move forward to resist anti-people's policies, to defend the rights of society, to defend the interests of the social majority, but above all, to defend ideas and values. We are here and we are fighting in defiance of the political cost when it comes to defending values. Our program is for a just society and prosperity for all, to defend the self-worth of human life, humanity, solidarity, the supreme values of life, equality, and freedom.

Friends and fellow citizens of Ioannina, today we witnessed a significant development - the withdrawal of New Democracy's candidate in Rhodope, Mr. A, from the already printed ballot papers. This withdrawal has exposed yet another bankruptcy, this time a moral one. The irresponsible attempt to involve our sensitive national issues in the electoral debate has failed in the eyes of the public. Mr. Mitsotakis' attempt to turn a sensitive national issue, such as that of Thrace, into a central issue of the electoral contest, simply because they cannot tolerate a 'pink slip' on the blue map, is proof of their arrogance.

The project of turning the National Intelligence Service into a personal tool of Mr Mitsotakis, who uses it to monitor his political opponents and trap them, is being attempted once again. He has put the predator's NSA to tell us who we should and shouldn't have on our ballots, but he didn't pay attention to the details. In the document he sent us, they seem to have forgotten to cross out the reference to their own candidate as "recruited" even in Ankara and the Turkish Consulate. For two weeks, they have been brazenly asking us for change for our own candidates while keeping their own candidate on the ballot paper, even though they themselves described him as a recruit in Ankara.

They asked us for statements of nationalism boldly, playing with the homeland irresponsibly and frivolously, while their own candidate for parliament made statements about the "Turks of Western Thrace". And so we all realized one thing: how hypocritical, ruthless, irresponsible, and dangerous Mr. Mitsotakis is, after all, when it comes to nationalism. New Democracy has learned a great lesson today.

SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance has not been, is not, and will not be a convenient opponent for them. I ask them to think about it. Convenient bipartisanship does not work for them. Fragmenting the vote into smaller, convenient protest parties will not work for them. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance will remain a strong pole of alternative governance against their unpopular plans.

Citizens of Ioannina and friends, the upcoming ballot box on Sunday has a double peculiarity. On the one hand, it follows the ballot of the simple proportional representation of May 21st, and in this sense, it carries a fresh popular mandate and an unfavorable correlation. But at the same time, it is also a new election with a new electoral system. It is not the second round that we have on the Sunday of the first round. It is a completely new electoral contest. To those who are in a hurry to predict the outcome of the popular verdict, I want to say, do not do so. Because the citizens will go into this election with the idea in their minds that it will finally decide who and how they will govern for the next four years. It is a final decision on what program will govern the country for the next four years. We call on Greek citizens to consider which programs are being put up for debate. There are two alternative plans: a plan to protect society and a plan, on the other hand, which is extremely neoliberal, aimed at the expansion of the private sphere, the plundering, I would say, of society.

Today, New Democracy is attempting to justify its policies, what it has done, and what it has led to in recent years by citing its share in the May polls. It is attempting to justify its choices, which have cost human lives in the pandemic, destroyed the labor market, abolished the eight-hour working day, and led to the collapse of the National Health System.

And that led to images like the ones we have seen in recent weeks, of our fellow human beings, such as the 63-year-old woman in Kos losing her life in the back of a car because there were no ambulance rescuers. And it did not just happen in Kos; it happened in Nea Makri and Halkidiki. That is our essential difference, the difference in values that we have with the neoliberal New Democracy.

We defend human life as a value, while they calculate costs and damages.

I said that New Democracy is trying to justify its policies and choices, which have destroyed the NHS.

Choices today threaten thousands of households with eviction and 700,000 houses with auctions. Elections deprive income with indirect taxes, undermine democracy with interceptions, and distribute billions with direct assignments.

With arrogance, smugness, and contempt, they tell us that "all of this has been decided, it ended with 40% of the previous ballot." But it is not over. And it has not ended, not only because we do not intend to stop fighting, but mainly because New Democracy does not intend to stop implementing these policies. It intends to continue them and even more intensely to continue the same policies.

This is demonstrated by the medium-term binding program they submitted to the European Commission, as well as the medium-term stability program they submitted two months ago. These programs have nothing to do with the extravagant measures announced by Mr. Mitsotakis during the election campaign.

This is the actual truth regarding the policies they will implement if elected for the next four years. Their program is filled with unspoken campaign promises, without the financial capacity to fulfill them.

A real reduction of the civil servants' payroll of 730 million is foreseen in their program, not an increase in civil servants' salaries.

A cumulative reduction of 10% in primary consumer spending in critical public sectors, such as health and education, over the next four years is envisaged in their program, not an increase in spending.

At the same time, you know what they are promising. They are promising a new NHS, with Mr Mitsotakis as a guarantor, and they have a real plan to reduce spending.

A real increase in the average wage is foreseen for only 1.3% cumulatively over the next four years, while they promise a 25% increase at the same time.

The New Democracy program says much that will not be implemented and hides much that they intend to implement. But some of what they do not officially admit, some of their candidates inadvertently reveal.

As Mr. Pneimatikos, a candidate for New Democracy, did, he revealed their plan for screening patients in the National Health System and for the privatization of hospitals. Do you remember what another of their ministers, Mr. Petsas, said? "He who does not adapt, dies." This is the ideology and plan of those who believe that inequalities are a natural phenomenon. Anyone with a low life expectancy will not receive expensive treatment. Someone with a higher life expectancy will receive it because healthcare is expensive and cannot be covered by the state. If they can afford to go to a private hospital, they are fine. If not, they will be left helpless. But this is not their only hidden plan for healthcare.

Let me remind you of what Mr. Georgiades said immediately after the May 21 elections: their goal is to win 180 seats so that they can change the Constitution on their own. And then Mr. Mitsotakis revealed their plan for private universities. With the admission base, they took the first step, closing departments and schools in the region.

The region is thirsty for life, knowledge, and economic growth through start-up businesses. It is also bleeding from brain-drain, not only to the outside world but also to the center, Athens. And all of this is happening to make room for speculation. These are critical issues for the next day, ones that New Democracy secretly plans and avoids discussing publicly.

We, friends, have tried and are trying in this election to highlight this truth in a programmatic and sharply focused way. The truth about what is going to happen in the next four years in our country. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance is the only party that proposes a solid, fair, progressive program for society and the country, in the opposite direction and with a completely different logic from the program of New Democracy. A political project that concerns the many, the social majority and not the few and powerful.

We want education that is public and free.

They want education to be subject to commercial exploitation and speculation, just like health, because we are the European Union country that has 35% private spending on healthcare, while the European average is 15%. We are also the country that has almost half the European average in terms of public per capita spending on health. That is why they want to shrink public healthcare even further. They have left public hospitals without doctors and nurses, and they are shrinking the staffing of doctors and nurses in local health units. For four years now, they have not hired a single permanent rescuer in the ambulance service, which is why people are dying helplessly and ambulances are not coming.

Because, let me remind you, when we were governing under the harshest conditions of the memoranda - and of course we had an obligation to wash the dirty laundry of the entire post-independence period, to clean up their dirty laundry - we received a country with empty coffers and no pensions to pay. Despite the harsh budgetary constraints, we tried to use every loophole we could find through tough negotiations to defend the interests of society.

That is why, despite the difficulties, we have included 2.5 million uninsured people in the National Health System. We have not left any Greek man or woman without healthcare. Despite the fact that we were under memoranda, I would like to remind you that when our political opponents were shouting "Geroun solid and vasta Schaeuble", we were fighting the battle to defend the interests of the social majority. Despite being under memoranda, we managed to hire 300 rescuers in the ambulance service.

Today, four years have passed and New Democracy is not under memoranda or budgetary constraints. However, it has not hired a single permanent ambulance rescuer despite 560 departures. This is obviously because public health is not a priority for them. A National Health System accessible to all Greeks, regardless of their financial situation, is not a priority. That is why their motto is true. They count costs and damages, while we count human lives!

And I want to remind you, friends, what the essential difference is. We were in the position of governing the country during the most difficult time since the post-war period. We had the obligation to raise almost 40 billion euros to bring the country out of bankruptcy.

The difference is that Mr. Mitsotakis found the funds in full, thanks to our efforts and the fact that we pulled the country out of the crisis and the memoranda.

We have managed the debt and left 40 billion in the public coffers. We are the only government since the post-war period that cannot be accused of leaving chaos to the next generation. We have managed every last euro of the Greek taxpayer with honesty.

The contrast is that the Mitsotakis government did not have the obligation to raise 40 billion; it was able to spend 60. The big question is: where exactly did these 60 billion go? Has public infrastructure been created today that is capable of supporting society, the weak, and the middle class in the face of the difficult days that will come in the coming period? Has this money gone into subsidies to keep prices high for the energy cartels, the refinery cartels, and the supermarket supply chain cartels? That is where that money went. EUR 15 billion went into direct awards and closed tenders, and EUR 10 billion went into subsidies, which you feel are going into your pocket, but they are not. It goes straight to the energy, supermarket, and refinery cartels.

That is the reality and the true comparison. We are presenting a program and a plan to the Greek people that looks towards the future with optimism because it has social justice at its core. We are discussing the need for productive reconstruction, a new model of economic growth based on innovation, knowledge, the fair distribution of resources, and the reduction of inequalities. We oppose the logic of state-run entrepreneurship, takeovers, and privatizations presented as investments. We have a plan to support the needs of society, the middle class, wage labor, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, livestock farmers, and young people, in opposition to the model of clientelism, favors, and privileges for the elites.

To tackle poverty and boost incomes, we plan to immediately raise the minimum wage to 880 euros with indexation, as well as increase civil servants' wages by 10% and all pensioners' by 7.5%.

We do not insist on this silly economic logic, which fortunately - and I hope our children, who took their final exams a few days ago in Principles of Economic Theory, did not hear what Mr. Skertsos and Mr. Mitsotakis said. They claimed that the reduction of VAT rates of indirect taxation favors the rich and powerful, but in reality, it favors the weak and middle class, as the books of our students who took the exams say. This is not like the lies and fake news of the government parrots.

We have a plan to reduce indirect taxes, including VAT on food, the special consumption tax on fuel, and the taxation of super-profits made by energy giants and refineries during the crisis. These companies accumulated 6 billion in super-profits at the expense of society, the economy, and citizens. This is the only way to break the vicious cycle of greed. By doing so, we can provide access and space for bank lending and the funds of the Recovery Fund to healthy small and medium-sized businesses. The first 600 million from the Recovery Fund went to only 10 large business groups, while 96% of small and medium-sized enterprises have no access to lending from systemic banks.

We assert that the future of the country cannot involve employer immunity. We require robust state intervention to uphold the security, dignity, and rights of wage labor.

We need to build a new NHS. We need quality public education with quality public schools and universities, with respect for teachers, professors, academics, and an emphasis on research. We need a welfare state for all that reduces inequalities with quality services and care for all, including children, mothers, young couples, the elderly, and disabled people.

To protect the first home and address the housing crisis, we must prevent the largest redistribution of real estate in the country's history in favor of a few and foreign interests.

But also to defend democracy, rights, and institutions that have been suffering in the last four years.

That is why we want a strong, interventionist, modern, and effective state that will not be a party or family spoil but a tool for development and service to citizens.

These are our own programmatic positions, my friends. It may seem like a good point, but the election results on May 21st do not guarantee that we will not be in power to implement them. Who will be in power and with what level of authority, and who will be in opposition and with how much power, we should not rush to judge. We must wait for the Greek people to make their final decision next Sunday. I want to emphasize one more thing: we are and will remain a party in power. We will not become a party of protest, nor will we ever become a party that complements the right-wing government of our political opponents. As a party in power, we will fight for every vote until the last second, so that we can implement the program that I have presented to you, our program. It is the only alternative plan of governance to the neoliberal plan of Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy.

But even if the people put us in opposition, watch out. On the basis of this program and these positions, we will oppose the anti-reforms that New Democracy is preparing, and we will be strong. That is why we call on every progressive, democratic citizen to realize that the stakes of the ballot box on the 25th of this month are not, as Mr Mitsotakis is blackmailing us, whether we will go to a third election. The stakes of the ballot are whether the next day we will have an uncontrolled and unaccountable regime ruling us. I call on democratic and progressive citizens not to allow this to happen with their vote. The only way to avoid this is to overturn the correlations that were formed in May.

To decisively strengthen the only force that can stand up and look in the eye with its own programmatic positions and with its own social resistance to the arrogance, the impunity, and the regime that Mr Mitsotakis wants to create, I want to say that we will be there. Not with batteries in the air and big words, but with persistent and determined programmatic confrontation. Because New Democracy did not implement these central programmatic choices in the previous four years because of the pandemic.

The Pneumatikos plan was not implemented because the pandemic occurred, and the hospitals could not be privatized. They will be privatized now, however, if Mr. Mitsotakis is elected.

The Pissarides plan for small and medium-sized enterprises was not implemented because the European Union came along and said "give refundable advances". It will now be implemented. What does the Pissarides plan provide for? 'Zombies' were telling SMEs to 'close down'.

Now they intend to implement their real plan if they receive a blank cheque, because that is their ideology. They tell us, "Let the market solve all the problems. Have a little patience and when we completely deregulate the labor market, cut taxes on the rich even more, privatize health care, education, water, infrastructure, then the pie will grow and you will all benefit." However, that moment will never come and has never come anywhere in the world where these neoliberal ideologies have been applied. Great social disasters and failures have occurred. We will fight until Sunday to prevent Mr. Mitsotakis from receiving a blank cheque for an extreme neoliberal program. In any case, we will be on the front line of the struggle to defend society from Monday.

SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, friends, has never been and will never be an easy opponent for the Right and Mr Mitsotakis. This is evident from the way they are rabidly seeking to discredit and distort reality. The May election result did not make them feel more comfortable, and with even more vulgarity, they are attempting to achieve their goal of getting rid of us so that they can be completely unaccountable and unchecked the next day.

In this current election battle, I have a feeling that they have outdone themselves. They have not only relied on fake news and Trump-style communication tactics, but they have also brought up the post-civil war theory of the enemy within.

They dared to call us a "national exception." They dared to call us "anti-Hellenic, minority, traitors." And I want to remind the older people and point out to the younger ones where these unacceptable practices have led, what slippery slopes these unacceptable practices have led to. From the time of the National Schism and the Civil War to later on, these practices that they use are dangerous and slippery. And I want to reiterate today: We do not allow you to consider and talk about the pillar of the Progressive Party in our country, about SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance for 1,200,000 voters as a "national exception," as "reduced national responsibility" citizens.

But they have reached the final step with the blackmail that Mrs. Bakoyannis dared to do in Thrace, when she wagged her finger at poor, unfortunate people and said to them: "You know what? If you don't vote for New Democracy, you will have a hard time for the next four years!" This message was not received by the minority. This message was addressed to every social category that has the aim or the thought of opposing, with its will or its positions, the intentions of the party and family regime that they want to create. That is why she said it in front of the cameras, to reach every home.

It was a threat to every social category that would think of resisting tomorrow. It may have been aimed at the minority today, but tomorrow it will be aimed at hospital doctors, nurses, taxi drivers, and tourism workers. It will be addressed to every social group that claims to have a better future.

We say that we are here as guarantors of democracy and rights, to defend every social group under attack, to fight for their rights, and to fight against a logic of flattening and regimentation. Therefore, friends, there is only one explanation for why they are behaving in this way. They are behaving in this way with this hatred and vulgarity towards Syriza for one reason only: because they are afraid of Syriza. They consider Syriza to be the great obstacle to their plans. With Syriza, they want, they believe, and that is why they have become more aggressive now that the opportunity to get rid of them has come.

We tell them: we come from far away and we will go far away. We are not a flash in the pan. We are a mature child of the needs of Greek society. We are here to express the anxieties and struggles of Greek society. SYRIZA is the only political force that can stand in the way of an uncontrolled and unaccountable New Democracy, which is attempting to transform itself into a regime. And this is precisely the dilemma and the stakes of the elections.

New Democracy wants a weak, fragmented, and convenient opposition, "divide and rule." Their plan is not to prevent many parties from entering parliament lest they lose self-reliance. Their plan is to get all seven and eight parties into parliament with no program, no strategy, no ballast, and some without basic political seriousness so that they have an opposition flattened by fragmentation.

In order for Mr Mitsotakis to emerge not as a Prime Minister, but as an unruly ruler, a politician who started out wanting to be like Macron and ended up becoming a spitting image of Orban. He has the same perception of immigration policy, the same perception of extreme nationalist positions, the same attitude towards democracy and rights with illegal surveillance and predator. Spitting image!

He wants, like Orban, to have an opposition that will not be able to oppose him. But we not only want to, but we can. That is why we will oppose this prospect at all costs. We have demonstrated this in government, but also in opposition. And it is precisely for this reason that we must and will fight this battle with even greater tenacity and determination. Until the last moment, home by home, vote by vote, so that SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance will be decisively strengthened at the ballot box on Sunday.

The great, dynamic, uncompromising force of the Left is the great pole of the democratic and progressive Party, which never allied itself with the Right. It did not compromise or retreat, but took on the difficult task of getting the country out of the memoranda to which New Democracy and PASOK condemned us. Because the history of this country did not begin in 2015, we know who bankrupted the country.

New Democracy and PASOK, which are still acting as complementary forces today, fought and destroyed simple proportional representation together. They act as complementary forces, as revealed by Mr Mitsotakis in an interview yesterday, when he said that "Mr Androulakis' innermost desire, which is not hidden, was the self-reliance of New Democracy." Mr Mitsotakis made this statement.

They act as complementary forces, and with their newly stated intention to change Article 16 and privatize universities.

They are not hiding! They are not hiding, and that is the great danger. The change of the Constitution with the consensus of New Democracy and PASOK aims to sweep away all the achievements and impose a hard neoliberalism constitutionally. The logic of speculation should be constitutionally enshrined in energy, water, education, and health.

So let's say it clearly: every progressive, democratic vote that doesn't go to the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance on Sunday objectively favors the New Democracy project. This is the truth that must become the property of every democratic citizen. Because the only thing New Democracy truly fears is a strong Syriza - the only political force that can stop it, that can confront it with a truly competitive, realistic, but also radical program of immediate implementation.

A government program, not a wish list: for the strengthening of the social majority, for democracy, the rule of law, the welfare state, for the world of work, for the many, for solidarity, freedom, equality, and the prospect of the common good.

And it is with this program, these values, and the stubbornness that these values and ideals give us that we will fight this battle in the next five days with determination. We will fight hard and beautifully because it is allowed to fall, but imperative to get up. And we have already risen, we are fighting, and we will continue to fight together on Monday, all together. Because we owe it to ourselves, to the Left, to progressive citizens, but above all to society whose interests we serve.

And it is for this society, for the working class, for the youth, for the scientists, for those who live by their labor and not by the labor of others, that each and every one of us in the coming days must and will be found in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every village here in Epirus, in every home. So that not a single vote is wasted. To give perspective to Greek society, the perspective of democracy. For the hope of justice not to be extinguished in this land, for a just society with prosperity for all. This struggle until Sunday, and beyond, will be an enduring struggle. It will be a struggle of ideas, it will be a struggle of dignity. And this is a struggle we are determined to fight and to win. And we will win it! No matter how much we have to fight, we will fight and we will win it. Thank you very much for your presence today, which is even more important than ever before. Now it is important that you are present in the squares and in the cafes and at home and at the ballot box next Sunday with optimism, with determination, with strength. Goodbye, goodbye, good race and good strength.
