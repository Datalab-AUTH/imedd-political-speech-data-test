And it is with this program, these values, and the stubbornness that these values and ideals give us that we will fight this battle in the next five days with determination. We will fight hard and beautifully because it is allowed to fall, but imperative to get up. And we have already risen, we are fighting, and we will continue to fight together on Monday, all together. Because we owe it to ourselves, to the Left, to progressive citizens, but above all to society whose interests we serve.
