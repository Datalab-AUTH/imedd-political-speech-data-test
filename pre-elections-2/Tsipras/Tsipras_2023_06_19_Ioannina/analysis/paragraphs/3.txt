The project of turning the National Intelligence Service into a personal tool of Mr Mitsotakis, who uses it to monitor his political opponents and trap them, is being attempted once again. He has put the predator's NSA to tell us who we should and shouldn't have on our ballots, but he didn't pay attention to the details. In the document he sent us, they seem to have forgotten to cross out the reference to their own candidate as "recruited" even in Ankara and the Turkish Consulate. For two weeks, they have been brazenly asking us for change for our own candidates while keeping their own candidate on the ballot paper, even though they themselves described him as a recruit in Ankara.
