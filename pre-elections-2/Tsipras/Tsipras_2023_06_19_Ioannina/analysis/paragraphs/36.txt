We have a plan to reduce indirect taxes, including VAT on food, the special consumption tax on fuel, and the taxation of super-profits made by energy giants and refineries during the crisis. These companies accumulated 6 billion in super-profits at the expense of society, the economy, and citizens. This is the only way to break the vicious cycle of greed. By doing so, we can provide access and space for bank lending and the funds of the Recovery Fund to healthy small and medium-sized businesses. The first 600 million from the Recovery Fund went to only 10 large business groups, while 96% of small and medium-sized enterprises have no access to lending from systemic banks.
