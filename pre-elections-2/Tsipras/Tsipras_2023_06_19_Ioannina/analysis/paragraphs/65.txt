And it is for this society, for the working class, for the youth, for the scientists, for those who live by their labor and not by the labor of others, that each and every one of us in the coming days must and will be found in every neighborhood, in every workplace, in every village here in Epirus, in every home. So that not a single vote is wasted. To give perspective to Greek society, the perspective of democracy. For the hope of justice not to be extinguished in this land, for a just society with prosperity for all. This struggle until Sunday, and beyond, will be an enduring struggle. It will be a struggle of ideas, it will be a struggle of dignity. And this is a struggle we are determined to fight and to win. And we will win it! No matter how much we have to fight, we will fight and we will win it. Thank you very much for your presence today, which is even more important than ever before. Now it is important that you are present in the squares and in the cafes and at home and at the ballot box next Sunday with optimism, with determination, with strength. Goodbye, goodbye, good race and good strength.
