They dared to call us a "national exception." They dared to call us "anti-Hellenic, minority, traitors." And I want to remind the older people and point out to the younger ones where these unacceptable practices have led, what slippery slopes these unacceptable practices have led to. From the time of the National Schism and the Civil War to later on, these practices that they use are dangerous and slippery. And I want to reiterate today: We do not allow you to consider and talk about the pillar of the Progressive Party in our country, about SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance for 1,200,000 voters as a "national exception," as "reduced national responsibility" citizens.
