As Mr. Pneimatikos, a candidate for New Democracy, did, he revealed their plan for screening patients in the National Health System and for the privatization of hospitals. Do you remember what another of their ministers, Mr. Petsas, said? "He who does not adapt, dies." This is the ideology and plan of those who believe that inequalities are a natural phenomenon. Anyone with a low life expectancy will not receive expensive treatment. Someone with a higher life expectancy will receive it because healthcare is expensive and cannot be covered by the state. If they can afford to go to a private hospital, they are fine. If not, they will be left helpless. But this is not their only hidden plan for healthcare.
