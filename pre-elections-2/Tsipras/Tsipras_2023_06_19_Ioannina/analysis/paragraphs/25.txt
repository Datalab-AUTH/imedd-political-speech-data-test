They want education to be subject to commercial exploitation and speculation, just like health, because we are the European Union country that has 35% private spending on healthcare, while the European average is 15%. We are also the country that has almost half the European average in terms of public per capita spending on health. That is why they want to shrink public healthcare even further. They have left public hospitals without doctors and nurses, and they are shrinking the staffing of doctors and nurses in local health units. For four years now, they have not hired a single permanent rescuer in the ambulance service, which is why people are dying helplessly and ambulances are not coming.
