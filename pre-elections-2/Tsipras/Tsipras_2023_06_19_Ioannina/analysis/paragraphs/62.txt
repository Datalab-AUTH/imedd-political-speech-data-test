So let's say it clearly: every progressive, democratic vote that doesn't go to the SYRIZA Progressive Alliance on Sunday objectively favors the New Democracy project. This is the truth that must become the property of every democratic citizen. Because the only thing New Democracy truly fears is a strong Syriza - the only political force that can stop it, that can confront it with a truly competitive, realistic, but also radical program of immediate implementation.
