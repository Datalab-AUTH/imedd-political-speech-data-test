Today, four years have passed and New Democracy is not under memoranda or budgetary constraints. However, it has not hired a single permanent ambulance rescuer despite 560 departures. This is obviously because public health is not a priority for them. A National Health System accessible to all Greeks, regardless of their financial situation, is not a priority. That is why their motto is true. They count costs and damages, while we count human lives!
