We do not insist on this silly economic logic, which fortunately - and I hope our children, who took their final exams a few days ago in Principles of Economic Theory, did not hear what Mr. Skertsos and Mr. Mitsotakis said. They claimed that the reduction of VAT rates of indirect taxation favors the rich and powerful, but in reality, it favors the weak and middle class, as the books of our students who took the exams say. This is not like the lies and fake news of the government parrots.
