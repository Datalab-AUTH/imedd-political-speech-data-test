Friends and fellow citizens of Ioannina, today we witnessed a significant development - the withdrawal of New Democracy's candidate in Rhodope, Mr. A, from the already printed ballot papers. This withdrawal has exposed yet another bankruptcy, this time a moral one. The irresponsible attempt to involve our sensitive national issues in the electoral debate has failed in the eyes of the public. Mr. Mitsotakis' attempt to turn a sensitive national issue, such as that of Thrace, into a central issue of the electoral contest, simply because they cannot tolerate a 'pink slip' on the blue map, is proof of their arrogance.
