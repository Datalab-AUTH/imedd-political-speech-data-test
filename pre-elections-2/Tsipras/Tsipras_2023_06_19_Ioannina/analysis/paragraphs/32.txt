The contrast is that the Mitsotakis government did not have the obligation to raise 40 billion; it was able to spend 60. The big question is: where exactly did these 60 billion go? Has public infrastructure been created today that is capable of supporting society, the weak, and the middle class in the face of the difficult days that will come in the coming period? Has this money gone into subsidies to keep prices high for the energy cartels, the refinery cartels, and the supermarket supply chain cartels? That is where that money went. EUR 15 billion went into direct awards and closed tenders, and EUR 10 billion went into subsidies, which you feel are going into your pocket, but they are not. It goes straight to the energy, supermarket, and refinery cartels.
