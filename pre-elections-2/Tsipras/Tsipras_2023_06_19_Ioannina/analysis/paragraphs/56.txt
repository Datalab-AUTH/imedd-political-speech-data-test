In order for Mr Mitsotakis to emerge not as a Prime Minister, but as an unruly ruler, a politician who started out wanting to be like Macron and ended up becoming a spitting image of Orban. He has the same perception of immigration policy, the same perception of extreme nationalist positions, the same attitude towards democracy and rights with illegal surveillance and predator. Spitting image!
