Citizens of Ioannina and friends, the upcoming ballot box on Sunday has a double peculiarity. On the one hand, it follows the ballot of the simple proportional representation of May 21st, and in this sense, it carries a fresh popular mandate and an unfavorable correlation. But at the same time, it is also a new election with a new electoral system. It is not the second round that we have on the Sunday of the first round. It is a completely new electoral contest. To those who are in a hurry to predict the outcome of the popular verdict, I want to say, do not do so. Because the citizens will go into this election with the idea in their minds that it will finally decide who and how they will govern for the next four years. It is a final decision on what program will govern the country for the next four years. We call on Greek citizens to consider which programs are being put up for debate. There are two alternative plans: a plan to protect society and a plan, on the other hand, which is extremely neoliberal, aimed at the expansion of the private sphere, the plundering, I would say, of society.
