New Democracy wants a weak, fragmented, and convenient opposition, "divide and rule." Their plan is not to prevent many parties from entering parliament lest they lose self-reliance. Their plan is to get all seven and eight parties into parliament with no program, no strategy, no ballast, and some without basic political seriousness so that they have an opposition flattened by fragmentation.
