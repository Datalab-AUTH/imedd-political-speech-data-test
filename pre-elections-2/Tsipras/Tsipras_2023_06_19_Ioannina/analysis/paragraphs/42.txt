These are our own programmatic positions, my friends. It may seem like a good point, but the election results on May 21st do not guarantee that we will not be in power to implement them. Who will be in power and with what level of authority, and who will be in opposition and with how much power, we should not rush to judge. We must wait for the Greek people to make their final decision next Sunday. I want to emphasize one more thing: we are and will remain a party in power. We will not become a party of protest, nor will we ever become a party that complements the right-wing government of our political opponents. As a party in power, we will fight for every vote until the last second, so that we can implement the program that I have presented to you, our program. It is the only alternative plan of governance to the neoliberal plan of Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy.
