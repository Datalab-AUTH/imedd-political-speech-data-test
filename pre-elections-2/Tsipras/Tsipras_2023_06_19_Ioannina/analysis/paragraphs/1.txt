Citizens of Ioannina, friends, your presence here today sends a message of determination and uncompromising struggle. I want to begin this speech by committing to you that we are and will be here, and we will fight together until Sunday, until the ballot box, until the last second. We have learned in our lives and in our history, in our journey, not to give up the fight. We have learned not to give up; we have learned to fight to overturn results. So we will fight this battle until the last minute for the big upset. We will fight together until the polls on the 25th, but I pledge to you that we will be together on the 26th. Together, we will move forward to resist anti-people's policies, to defend the rights of society, to defend the interests of the social majority, but above all, to defend ideas and values. We are here and we are fighting in defiance of the political cost when it comes to defending values. Our program is for a just society and prosperity for all, to defend the self-worth of human life, humanity, solidarity, the supreme values of life, equality, and freedom.
