That is the reality and the true comparison. We are presenting a program and a plan to the Greek people that looks towards the future with optimism because it has social justice at its core. We are discussing the need for productive reconstruction, a new model of economic growth based on innovation, knowledge, the fair distribution of resources, and the reduction of inequalities. We oppose the logic of state-run entrepreneurship, takeovers, and privatizations presented as investments. We have a plan to support the needs of society, the middle class, wage labor, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, livestock farmers, and young people, in opposition to the model of clientelism, favors, and privileges for the elites.
