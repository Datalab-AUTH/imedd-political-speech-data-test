SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance has not been, is not, and will not be a convenient opponent for them. I ask them to think about it. Convenient bipartisanship does not work for them. Fragmenting the vote into smaller, convenient protest parties will not work for them. SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance will remain a strong pole of alternative governance against their unpopular plans.
