We say that we are here as guarantors of democracy and rights, to defend every social group under attack, to fight for their rights, and to fight against a logic of flattening and regimentation. Therefore, friends, there is only one explanation for why they are behaving in this way. They are behaving in this way with this hatred and vulgarity towards Syriza for one reason only: because they are afraid of Syriza. They consider Syriza to be the great obstacle to their plans. With Syriza, they want, they believe, and that is why they have become more aggressive now that the opportunity to get rid of them has come.
