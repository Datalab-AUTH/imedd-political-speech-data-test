But even if the people put us in opposition, watch out. On the basis of this program and these positions, we will oppose the anti-reforms that New Democracy is preparing, and we will be strong. That is why we call on every progressive, democratic citizen to realize that the stakes of the ballot box on the 25th of this month are not, as Mr Mitsotakis is blackmailing us, whether we will go to a third election. The stakes of the ballot are whether the next day we will have an uncontrolled and unaccountable regime ruling us. I call on democratic and progressive citizens not to allow this to happen with their vote. The only way to avoid this is to overturn the correlations that were formed in May.
