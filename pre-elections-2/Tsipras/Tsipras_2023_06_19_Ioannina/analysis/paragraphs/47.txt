Now they intend to implement their real plan if they receive a blank cheque, because that is their ideology. They tell us, "Let the market solve all the problems. Have a little patience and when we completely deregulate the labor market, cut taxes on the rich even more, privatize health care, education, water, infrastructure, then the pie will grow and you will all benefit." However, that moment will never come and has never come anywhere in the world where these neoliberal ideologies have been applied. Great social disasters and failures have occurred. We will fight until Sunday to prevent Mr. Mitsotakis from receiving a blank cheque for an extreme neoliberal program. In any case, we will be on the front line of the struggle to defend society from Monday.
