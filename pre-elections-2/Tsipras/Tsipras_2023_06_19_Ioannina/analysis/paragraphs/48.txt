SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, friends, has never been and will never be an easy opponent for the Right and Mr Mitsotakis. This is evident from the way they are rabidly seeking to discredit and distort reality. The May election result did not make them feel more comfortable, and with even more vulgarity, they are attempting to achieve their goal of getting rid of us so that they can be completely unaccountable and unchecked the next day.
