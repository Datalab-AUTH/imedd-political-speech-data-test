New Democracy and PASOK, which are still acting as complementary forces today, fought and destroyed simple proportional representation together. They act as complementary forces, as revealed by Mr Mitsotakis in an interview yesterday, when he said that "Mr Androulakis' innermost desire, which is not hidden, was the self-reliance of New Democracy." Mr Mitsotakis made this statement.
