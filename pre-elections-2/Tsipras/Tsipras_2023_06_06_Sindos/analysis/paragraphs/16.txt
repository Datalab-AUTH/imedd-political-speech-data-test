To talk about wages and collective agreements, let's first discuss the trick behind maintaining the high VAT of 6 billion euros. It is the first time in the post-independence period that indirect taxes have reached 60%, and we are being made fun of as if we were small children. The rich are being protected, not the poor, because if we hurt the rich, they will be affected. But whose plan is this? They collect 6 billion euros in public funds and give targeted subsidies to citizens, who then give directly to energy companies, refining companies, and supermarket supply chain companies, keeping prices high. This is the redistribution of wealth. However, the Commission suggested that VAT should be reduced in all European countries during periods of price inflation. Only three countries in the European Union did not listen to this advice: Greece, Slovakia, and Malta. Greece is one of these three countries. The Commission has now announced that subsidies will end by the end of 2023. The big question is, what will happen after 2023? How will the average citizen cope with prices not falling? Prices in Greece remain high, even though prices are falling all over Europe. How will the government deal with the wave of price inflation, and what is their plan?
