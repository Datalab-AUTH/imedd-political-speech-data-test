The previous elections were held under a system of proportional representation. It was a vision for us, and it was also a constant position and demand of the Left and progressive forces in the country that there should be parity in the vote of each and every person. We do not regret having defended this vision. Others must regret not giving the country's political system the opportunity to turn a new page, to move away from toxicity, and to move towards a government of cooperation on programmatic convergences.
