But look at the irony of those who accused us three days before the elections and mobilized with all their associations of small and medium-sized professionals, claiming that we were going to increase their contributions as if we were back under the memoranda. Three days later, it turned out that they had missed the deadline, leaving uninsured freelancers and farmers. Those who could not pay their debts, i.e. their insurance contributions, and those who were left uninsured because they cannot afford to give a collective 750 â‚¬, are left out of Eoppy's healthcare and will not even have access to the medicines that Eoppy provides.
