But shall I put the issues on a different basis today? We had a difficult painful, I will not hide the result in the election of the twenty-first of May on the 25th of June, but we have a new electoral process. It's not a rematch, as we say in soccer where the score of the first game counts starts zero to zero. The race is a new race, it is not to paraphrase like a football race, we are like them like the jumper who set the bar high. He didn't get his stride right, he made a bad jump, but he has a second chance to cross the bar and we want to take advantage of every opportunity and fight to the last second to correct our weaknesses and mistakes so that in this election we can speak up and look the people in the eye. Speaking to them in the language of truth and putting at the centre of the debate the real problems that affect our lives, our everyday life.
