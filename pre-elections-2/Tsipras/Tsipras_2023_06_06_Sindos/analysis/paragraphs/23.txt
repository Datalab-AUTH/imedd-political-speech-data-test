And we come to another big issue. You saw an elderly man in Halkidiki who is handicapped and still living out of his house because he was a guarantor on a loan of his unemployed son for a few thousand euros. A single parent family with a disabled child is also being forced out of their house. We will see these images by the dozens in the next four years if the Mitsotakis plan is implemented. 700,000 mortgages have gone through the banks' hands and are waiting to be auctioned off because that is their plan. It was no accident that Mr. Patsis, a member of the New Democracy parliamentary group, showed irony and hypocrisy by taking people's homes for a few thousand euros. The funds that have bought the loans at 20% of their value want to take 100%. And who passed these laws? The party that owes 400 million to the banks and doesn't give a penny.
