And I want to tell you that for me, your welcome, your passion, and your determination are more important today than ever before. Today, we all need to stand together because we are not just a flash in the pan. We come from far and wide, and we will go far and wide because we express and represent the needs and social needs of underprivileged Greeks. We also express and represent the interests of the working class, small and medium-sized businesses, wage laborers, and young people. We express and represent the interests of Greece, which has no voice. That is why we will always be on the front lines, fighting against neoliberal and anti-people's policies. Society needs a strong SYRIZA that can act as a barrier to these policies.
