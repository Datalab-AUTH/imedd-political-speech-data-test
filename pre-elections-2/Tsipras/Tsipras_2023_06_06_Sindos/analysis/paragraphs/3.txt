We are talking about human lives. They asked us to cost our program. Remember when we said, "Let's go cost it together," they hid. But I really want to ask myself, how much does human life cost? How much does it cost to be able to live with dignity? How much does it cost not to run away like a dog in a vineyard in the back of a farm car because there are no staff in the ambulance service, even when there are ambulances? So, how much does human life cost? Yes, this is the motto of the young children. Our vision is to talk about profits and losses, but it is time to talk about human life, human lives.
