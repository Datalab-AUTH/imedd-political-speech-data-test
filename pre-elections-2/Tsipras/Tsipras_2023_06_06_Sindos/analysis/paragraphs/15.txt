What is the biggest problem today? The biggest problem is the issue of income accuracy, which runs out on the third week of the month. You can't easily go to the supermarket, you can't afford to pay electricity bills, and pensioners' pensions have remained the same for all these years. In 2019, purchasing power had 40% more, but for incomes up to €700, purchasing power has fallen 40%, according to Eurostat data. And what exactly is Mr Mitsotakis telling us? He tells us that he has not imposed a single tax over the years. The truth is that in the last 16 months, he has put 6 billion more taxes on the middle classes, pensioners, wage earners, and the weak. Because when the price and inflation are running at 10% and 15% monthly, you don't need to raise tax rates to bake taxes. It's enough to keep them constant when the household basket was €50 and now the basket is €100, and it remains constant. The VAT doubles the tax paid by the citizen when you fill the tank with €50, and now you fill it with €100, doubling the space paid by the citizen in the petrol stations, 6 billion in the last sixteen months.
