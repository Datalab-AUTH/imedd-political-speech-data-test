Because we all have a history in this place and we are not a flare that will go out. We are children of the need to grow up and we grew up in the most difficult moments of the last years in the crisis of memoranda, in the struggle of the Greek people to claim dignity and rights. We achieved a historic victory in 2015. We confronted the lenders with passion and honesty. They wanted to bail out our country when our opponents were shouting "vasta Schaeuble" and gerunds. We managed the last euro of the Greek citizen with integrity.
