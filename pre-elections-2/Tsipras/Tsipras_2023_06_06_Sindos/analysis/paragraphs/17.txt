We have a plan to reduce VAT, excise duty, and VAT on foodstuffs to the lowest possible rate, and to a zero rate for basic necessities. We also plan to reduce excise duty to the European Union's minimum levels. Additionally, we will cancel the payment of excise duty on agricultural and livestock oil, which is a concern for farmers and livestock farmers worldwide. We propose to increase the minimum wage to â‚¬880 with the introduction of annual indexation. This will be the first increase in 14 years, and civil servants will receive a 10% salary increase. Our plan is to increase wages and reduce prices so that the middle class and workers can afford it. This includes wage earners, farmers, and stockbreeders.
