If we have a national goal in the coming years, that goal is to converge with the European average. Convergence with the European average means an increase in wages and the average wage, but also labor normality. It will never be possible to increase the wage to 1500, as falsely promised without collective bargaining and without unfreezing triennials. How can we raise the minimum and average wage? If triennials are unfrozen, how can the workforce be supported without collective bargaining? That's our plan, and that's the plan we want to put forward. We will look the Greek people in the eye and tell the truth about what is coming and what we are proposing.
