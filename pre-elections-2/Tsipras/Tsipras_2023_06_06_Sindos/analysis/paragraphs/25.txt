So, my friends and fellow citizens of Imbros, there are two opposing plans. One plan aims to continue inefficiency, income plundering, and support for the powerful. The other plan, our plan, aims to support the weak and cut the obscenity of the cartels. The clashing plans are those that want to continue looting, social looting of auctions, and those that want debt regulation and social protection, protection of the first home, commercial housing, and agricultural land. The clashing plans are also those that want to continue dismantling the national health system, as we saw yesterday with the woman who was lost in the back of a lorry in Kos.
