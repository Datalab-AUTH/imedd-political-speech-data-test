It is a great pleasure to be here in Sindos, in western Thessaloniki. It is a great pleasure because I know very well that your region is the backyard of Thessaloniki. It is perhaps the most discredited and forgotten region of the capital, and it is the region where we have to work together for obvious rights: the right to public health and healthcare, the right to public education and decent conditions for the education of our children, and even the right to drinking water. Obvious things have not been won for the region of Sindos and western Thessaloniki. The right to decent work at wages that will enable a decent life, the right to provide for its people, those who have worked and retired, to give an allowance to their grandchildren, but also the right of young people to carve out a future with optimism, to live their dreams, and to live in the place where they were born and raised. These are the crucial issues for which we will fight and will always fight together, from whatever position.
