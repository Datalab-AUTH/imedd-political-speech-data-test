So we say, don't do them any favors. We need a strong SYRIZA progressive alliance, a strong force on the side of the people, on the side of society, to prevent social plunder. We understand the difficulty of the correlations, but we say that this is indeed a new ballot box and we will exhaust every last second of our time, house by house, soul by soul, vote by vote, in order to reverse this correlation to the last second. We will fight to reverse this correlation for the benefit of the workers, the farmers, and the underprivileged of society. We will be on the side of society today, tomorrow, and always, and we will fight. So I call on you, yes, and on June 25th to go together in a great counterattack, to overturn the correlations for a victorious electoral result. Can we achieve it together? We can make it happen, and together we can strengthen the voice and the power of the Greek people, the good ones, the next day.
