We are here to say that not every social group can be treated as an internal enemy, and we cannot be led to social automatism. We will be here, and I want to say this from democratic Heraklion. To say that SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, whatever happens, will be here to defend every social group, every social category, to defend democracy. In our country, democracy is and will remain strong. We will be here as a guarantor of democracy, of the rule of law. We will be here to break the fear. Fear will not go away, terror will not go away, intimidation will not go away.
