Friends, the message that has been emanating lately from the New Democracy cadres in a very sharp way is a message of arrogance and conceit. For hours on end, they do not hesitate to turn this arrogance and conceit into crude blackmail, terrorism, and intimidation. The message they are sending out is clear: any social group or productive sector that dares to claim a better future and a fairer distribution of the wealth that this country produces - as Mrs Bakoyannis said in Thrace - "will have a hard time in the next four years"! Note this message from Mrs Bakoyannis, your compatriot from Chania. This message was not addressed to the Muslim minority; it was addressed to every home, every family, and every social group. Today it may be Muslims, tomorrow it will be nurses, the day after tomorrow it will be taxi drivers, the day after that it will be teachers, and the day after that it will be tourism workers. Any social group that has a will other than the will of the almighty power of the party and the family will have a hard time.
