But to get there, I would say we need to look at the big picture. Working in small and medium-sized enterprises has a particular characteristic that you know very well: the special and sometimes personal relationship between the entrepreneur and the employee. The well-being of one is a necessary condition for the well-being of the other. When there are companies with miserable labor relations that exploit and underpay their workers in a sector or region, they create conditions of unfair competition with all the others. For all of you who know that a healthy market that operates by rules means increased productivity and lower employee turnover, it implies prosperity for all, not just for a powerful few.
