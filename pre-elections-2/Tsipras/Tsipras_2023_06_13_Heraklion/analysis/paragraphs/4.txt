Today, we have decided to move forward with a cycle of programmatic interventions focusing on an issue critical for every region of our country, which benefits significantly from the tourism sector of the economy. This decision comes after two similar events, one for our entire program and one two days ago for our positions on public health. Public health has been in the crosshairs for four years now, and the National Health System is collapsing. We made this decision here in Crete, in Heraklion. We will discuss the ability of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship to endure and play a crucial role in a new tourism model, which our country needs.
