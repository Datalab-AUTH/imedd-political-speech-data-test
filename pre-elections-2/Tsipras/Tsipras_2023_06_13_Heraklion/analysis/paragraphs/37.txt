The ones who gave over 15 billion in direct awards and closed tenders with total opacity during the pandemic period? They gave the first 600 million of the Recovery Fund loans to 13 large companies, which had access to lending from mainstream banks but at a higher interest rate, and now swapped the interest rate to make a profit. They did not give financing to any small and medium-sized enterprises. We called for a bipartisan committee in Parliament to oversee the allocation of these funds and the management of the 30 billion in the Recovery Fund a year ago, but they refused.
