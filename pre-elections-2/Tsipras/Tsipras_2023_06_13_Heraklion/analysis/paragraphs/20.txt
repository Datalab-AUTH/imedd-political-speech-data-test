This means increased obligations for the major monopoly players in infrastructure and transportation in our country to make strategic investments, not grab-and-go. It also means a plan for significant public investment in infrastructure. However, it also means the creation of a new generation of transportation projects that take into account the goal of zero carbon emissions in a highly energy-intensive sector. There are many examples here as well, but since we are in Crete, allow me to refer only to the vision of creating a fixed-track vehicle that will initially link the new Kastelli airport with the city of Heraklion.
