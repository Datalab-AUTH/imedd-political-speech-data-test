We want a just society and prosperity for all. What does our program say? That is what we want. And for that, we need a plan. And for that, we need will. Will for a strong and modern developmental state. I assure you that we have the plan, we have the will, and we will fight to the end to make it happen. I want to make a commitment to you. From whatever position, we will fight to the end together to make it happen. We will fight together. Be well, thank you very much. Goodbye.
