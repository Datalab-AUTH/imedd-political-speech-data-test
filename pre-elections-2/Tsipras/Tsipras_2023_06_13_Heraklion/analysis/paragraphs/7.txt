To date, the dominant element of the tourism product in Greece is what I would call a "triple concentration": thematic concentration around the dominant product, the sun, and the sea; geographical concentration along the coastal zone; and temporal concentration in the summer months of the year. However, in an international tourism market characterized by intense competition, with increasingly informed and demanding travelers, with modern technologies playing a decisive role, it is now necessary, we believe, to devise another national tourism strategy. Decisions and strategies for development models, both overall and in the tourism sector in particular, cannot be developed in the absence of the people of the tourism sector: the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and workers who, through their daily efforts, keep the country and their sector standing.
