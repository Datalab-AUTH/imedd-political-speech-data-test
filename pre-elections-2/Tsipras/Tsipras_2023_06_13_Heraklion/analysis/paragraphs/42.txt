That is why today, I would like to extend an invitation to all democratic citizens, regardless of party preferences and choices, and appeal to them to put a stop to the arrogance of power. Strengthen SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance with your vote on June 25 and take the cause of the reversal of the correlations into your own hands. It is crucial for our lives for the next four years. Fill the electoral map with prefectures in the color of SYRIZA on June 25. Fill the map with the only color that disturbs the arrogance, the omnipotence, the arrogance, the arrogance, the vindictiveness of the Right.
