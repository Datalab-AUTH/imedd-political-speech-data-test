With the same objective, we foresee the institutionalization of an SME, Self-Employed, and Farmers' Fund integrated, if you like, "dangled," so to speak, from the Development Bank, with the aim of financing SMEs with working capital, microcredit, commercial and agricultural credit, leasing, and factoring. This is what systemic banks should normally do, but they do not because today 96% of businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises in our country, do not have access to bank loans. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and those in tourism do not have the opportunity to finance their development investment projects from systemic banks.
