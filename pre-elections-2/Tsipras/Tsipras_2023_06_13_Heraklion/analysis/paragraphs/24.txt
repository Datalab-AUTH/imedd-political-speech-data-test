This plan of ours is in complete contrast to the Pissarides report, which the Mitsotakis government's plan for the use of the Recovery Fund resources, "Greece 2.0", was based on, if you remember. This plan was not implemented in its entirety because it was interrupted by the pandemic. However, this plan foresees the total shrinkage of small and medium-sized enterprises in the coming period. It was interrupted by the pandemic, which led to the possibility of significant subsidies being granted at that time, repayable advances. But the plan for the next four years of the Mitsotakis Government is not advances, not even repayable advances. It is the shrinking of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and we should bear that in mind.
