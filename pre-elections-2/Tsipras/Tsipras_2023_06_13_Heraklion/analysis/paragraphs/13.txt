In a global market where trends indicate an increased demand for differentiated products with a strong identity and local character, the Greek tourism product is characterized by insufficient differentiation and remains typically oriented towards the "sun and sea" model of organized holiday tourism. However, this model alone is not sufficient to ensure the sustainable development of tourism in the country, while our inability to support specific and alternative forms of tourism perpetuates chronic problems such as seasonality and concentration of tourism activity. These problems affect businesses in the sector and local economies. Diversification of the Greek tourism product requires the identification of the comparative advantages and the environmental and spatial limits of each region of the country. It then requires the removal of any obstacles in terms of the institutional framework, infrastructure, and incentives for the development of specific forms of tourism.
