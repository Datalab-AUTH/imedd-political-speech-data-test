Our plan for safe and green transportation and infrastructure is part of this new national strategy. The country needs a modern infrastructure network, including water supply infrastructure such as biological treatment plants, roads, and waterways, as well as modern telecommunications networks and public health infrastructure for adequate health coverage in all tourist areas. This will allow the state to guarantee safety for both visitors and its citizens.
