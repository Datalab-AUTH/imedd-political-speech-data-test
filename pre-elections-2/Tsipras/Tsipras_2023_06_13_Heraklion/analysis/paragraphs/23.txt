Dear friends, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance recognizes the workers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who are active in tourism as equal and valuable partners in the formulation of the national strategy. This new national strategy that I have outlined above, but also as equal and valuable partners overall in the elaboration of a new productive model for the Greek economy and for the country. We want more modern, innovative, and strong small and medium-sized enterprises that are sustainable and provide stable and good jobs.
