But all of this, my friends, cannot be served by a government whose main orientation is to continue the work of privatization in transportation, which was not completed during the years of the memoranda when it was imposed by the Troika. Our opposition to the privatization policy is not a matter of ideology but of cost-benefit analysis for the economy and society. Take, for example, the port of Heraklion, where it was announced only yesterday that the tender for the sale of 67% of the shares was completed. This development will objectively increase the cost of transport to the island and will also increase the cost of raw materials. An increase that will inevitably be passed on to the island's own tourist economy, making it less competitive on the international market.
