All of this, of course, presupposes that the networks are developed in a rational way, meaning that the electricity networks are under public control. One of the biggest and most important reforms made by the Syriza government, which was the energy communities, has been inactive for four years. It was left inactive for four years because the necessary investments in the network were not made. Of course, 49% of the DEDDIE was privatized, so there were energy communities that had no access to the network, and whatever little opportunities there were were given exclusively to big business groups.
