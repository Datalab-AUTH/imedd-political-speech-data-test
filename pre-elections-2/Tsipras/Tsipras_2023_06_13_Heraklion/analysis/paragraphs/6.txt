In a period of crises, profound changes, and unprecedented fiscal possibilities, the New Democracy government of the last four years chose to leave Greek tourism on autopilot. Instead of taking advantage of the mandatory respite from the pandemic to initiate the necessary structural changes, in the end, all it cared about in the tourism sector was to compete with the tourism performance of 2019, i.e., the success of our own government. But without ultimately succeeding in this either, it ultimately nullified the effort that we made, that we prepared to transition to a new model of tourism development. The result of this choice is that Greek tourism today has substantial structural deficiencies in terms of infrastructure, the diversification of the tourism product, the quality of the services offered, and the institutional framework, which make tourism an increasingly weak player in an increasingly competitive and complex international market, but also a victim of international geopolitical developments.
