The integrated approach to tourism development requires the interconnection of tourism with other critical sectors for the country's development. I spoke earlier about the primary sector, agriculture, rural development, fisheries, processing, manufacturing, culture, which is the country's most critical strategic asset, and renewable energy sources. The new national tourism strategy we are proposing is based on an integrated approach that combines, coordinates, and cultivates synergies with related and mutually beneficial sectors of the economy. Only then can we talk about sustainable tourism development, and only then can tourism unleash its potential for the development of the country as a whole. It is our conviction that Greek tourism is now in a position to make this leap towards a green production model.
