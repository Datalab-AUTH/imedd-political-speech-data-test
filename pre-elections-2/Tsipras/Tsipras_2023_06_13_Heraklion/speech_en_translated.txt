Thank you all very much for your presence and applause. It is a great pleasure to be here again in Crete, specifically in Heraklion, to highlight our programmatic positions.

In this difficult, but most crucial battle that we are waging in view of the June 25th elections, we have decided to ignore fake news, mudslinging, and vulgarity, and instead present our positions and program to the Greek people.

To talk about the big problems facing us today, but above all about the solutions. The solutions that we propose in the medium and long term, so that we can support small and medium-sized enterprises, people in work, highlight the competitive advantages of local economies, move towards a new productive model that will exploit the potential of each individual place, and have a perspective and horizon for our vision: a just society and prosperity for all.

Today, we have decided to move forward with a cycle of programmatic interventions focusing on an issue critical for every region of our country, which benefits significantly from the tourism sector of the economy. This decision comes after two similar events, one for our entire program and one two days ago for our positions on public health. Public health has been in the crosshairs for four years now, and the National Health System is collapsing. We made this decision here in Crete, in Heraklion. We will discuss the ability of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship to endure and play a crucial role in a new tourism model, which our country needs.

Friends, despite the importance of the tourism sector for the national economy, we must admit that unfortunately, today it is not the subject of coherent political planning. This works to the detriment of the necessary national strategy for a sector that we are otherwise accustomed to describing as a 'national champion' and as the 'economic engine' for the country.

In a period of crises, profound changes, and unprecedented fiscal possibilities, the New Democracy government of the last four years chose to leave Greek tourism on autopilot. Instead of taking advantage of the mandatory respite from the pandemic to initiate the necessary structural changes, in the end, all it cared about in the tourism sector was to compete with the tourism performance of 2019, i.e., the success of our own government. But without ultimately succeeding in this either, it ultimately nullified the effort that we made, that we prepared to transition to a new model of tourism development. The result of this choice is that Greek tourism today has substantial structural deficiencies in terms of infrastructure, the diversification of the tourism product, the quality of the services offered, and the institutional framework, which make tourism an increasingly weak player in an increasingly competitive and complex international market, but also a victim of international geopolitical developments.

To date, the dominant element of the tourism product in Greece is what I would call a "triple concentration": thematic concentration around the dominant product, the sun, and the sea; geographical concentration along the coastal zone; and temporal concentration in the summer months of the year. However, in an international tourism market characterized by intense competition, with increasingly informed and demanding travelers, with modern technologies playing a decisive role, it is now necessary, we believe, to devise another national tourism strategy. Decisions and strategies for development models, both overall and in the tourism sector in particular, cannot be developed in the absence of the people of the tourism sector: the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and workers who, through their daily efforts, keep the country and their sector standing.

We see tourism as a vehicle through which we can promote the overall transformation of the Greek economy towards green and sustainable development. All the commitments and policies we propose are geared towards our vision of a just society and economy with respect for the environment and the long-term prospects of the country. It is in this context that we are developing a new national strategy for Greek tourism. Let me briefly outline the five key features of this new national strategy:

Firstly, diversify the tourism product by setting central objectives at the national level and specific, differentiated objectives at the regional and local levels.

Secondly, the adoption of an integrated approach to tourism development, taking into account its interconnection with other critical sectors of the national and local economy, and in particular with the primary sector of production.

Thirdly, the transition of tourism businesses to a new model of energy and waste management will make them national champions in energy saving and energy efficiency. This can be achieved by implementing the principle of cyclicality on all stages of production and consumption of the tourism product.

Another crucial feature for us is the emphasis on safe and green transportation and infrastructure, which are prerequisites for human mobility.

In a global market where trends indicate an increased demand for differentiated products with a strong identity and local character, the Greek tourism product is characterized by insufficient differentiation and remains typically oriented towards the "sun and sea" model of organized holiday tourism. However, this model alone is not sufficient to ensure the sustainable development of tourism in the country, while our inability to support specific and alternative forms of tourism perpetuates chronic problems such as seasonality and concentration of tourism activity. These problems affect businesses in the sector and local economies. Diversification of the Greek tourism product requires the identification of the comparative advantages and the environmental and spatial limits of each region of the country. It then requires the removal of any obstacles in terms of the institutional framework, infrastructure, and incentives for the development of specific forms of tourism.

The integrated approach to tourism development requires the interconnection of tourism with other critical sectors for the country's development. I spoke earlier about the primary sector, agriculture, rural development, fisheries, processing, manufacturing, culture, which is the country's most critical strategic asset, and renewable energy sources. The new national tourism strategy we are proposing is based on an integrated approach that combines, coordinates, and cultivates synergies with related and mutually beneficial sectors of the economy. Only then can we talk about sustainable tourism development, and only then can tourism unleash its potential for the development of the country as a whole. It is our conviction that Greek tourism is now in a position to make this leap towards a green production model.

The available resources of the Recovery Fund are a crucial tool. It is a great opportunity that we must not miss. It allows us to design a more ambitious energy-saving programme for hotels and small and medium-sized tourism businesses, making this programme a vehicle for the renovation of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in the sector.

Accordingly, achieving the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the necessity of stabilizing the electricity grid, requires us to view small and medium-sized tourism businesses as both consumers and producers of the energy they consume.

All of this, of course, presupposes that the networks are developed in a rational way, meaning that the electricity networks are under public control. One of the biggest and most important reforms made by the Syriza government, which was the energy communities, has been inactive for four years. It was left inactive for four years because the necessary investments in the network were not made. Of course, 49% of the DEDDIE was privatized, so there were energy communities that had no access to the network, and whatever little opportunities there were were given exclusively to big business groups.

Also, tourist areas have been plagued by insurmountable problems in waste management for years. We must begin to understand the residues of production and consumption not as waste, but as a wealth to be managed as raw material within a new model of circular management of waste and food.

Our plan for safe and green transportation and infrastructure is part of this new national strategy. The country needs a modern infrastructure network, including water supply infrastructure such as biological treatment plants, roads, and waterways, as well as modern telecommunications networks and public health infrastructure for adequate health coverage in all tourist areas. This will allow the state to guarantee safety for both visitors and its citizens.

This means increased obligations for the major monopoly players in infrastructure and transportation in our country to make strategic investments, not grab-and-go. It also means a plan for significant public investment in infrastructure. However, it also means the creation of a new generation of transportation projects that take into account the goal of zero carbon emissions in a highly energy-intensive sector. There are many examples here as well, but since we are in Crete, allow me to refer only to the vision of creating a fixed-track vehicle that will initially link the new Kastelli airport with the city of Heraklion.

But all of this, my friends, cannot be served by a government whose main orientation is to continue the work of privatization in transportation, which was not completed during the years of the memoranda when it was imposed by the Troika. Our opposition to the privatization policy is not a matter of ideology but of cost-benefit analysis for the economy and society. Take, for example, the port of Heraklion, where it was announced only yesterday that the tender for the sale of 67% of the shares was completed. This development will objectively increase the cost of transport to the island and will also increase the cost of raw materials. An increase that will inevitably be passed on to the island's own tourist economy, making it less competitive on the international market.

Safe and green transport infrastructure means having the ability for the public sector to strategically intervene and maintain control, where possible. This is our position.

Dear friends, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance recognizes the workers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who are active in tourism as equal and valuable partners in the formulation of the national strategy. This new national strategy that I have outlined above, but also as equal and valuable partners overall in the elaboration of a new productive model for the Greek economy and for the country. We want more modern, innovative, and strong small and medium-sized enterprises that are sustainable and provide stable and good jobs.

This plan of ours is in complete contrast to the Pissarides report, which the Mitsotakis government's plan for the use of the Recovery Fund resources, "Greece 2.0", was based on, if you remember. This plan was not implemented in its entirety because it was interrupted by the pandemic. However, this plan foresees the total shrinkage of small and medium-sized enterprises in the coming period. It was interrupted by the pandemic, which led to the possibility of significant subsidies being granted at that time, repayable advances. But the plan for the next four years of the Mitsotakis Government is not advances, not even repayable advances. It is the shrinking of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and we should bear that in mind.

And if some people, through their grey propaganda, accused SYRIZA of allegedly wanting to increase contributions to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and farmers, the truth is that SYRIZA's plan is to regulate the debts of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and farmers. Not increases in contributions.

On the contrary, those who accused us with their black propaganda of having a plan to increase contributions were the same ones who, a few days later, left a very significant part of freelancers who could not afford to pay their annual contributions to EFKA outside the possibility of healthcare from EOPYY.

Let me remind you that during the difficult years of the memorandum, with the Troika hovering over our heads, we did exactly the opposite. We brought 2.5 million uninsured citizens into the public healthcare system. We did not throw them out.

SMEs need support to grow, cooperate, invest in innovation, extroversion, and the production of high-value-added products and services. For us, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs do not constitute a "problem" for the Greek economy - as New Democracy has argued - but a central pillar of the solution to the wider issue that concerns us and concerns the productive model of the country. To this end, our program includes concrete and costed measures.

Measures to resolve the issue of private debt include protecting the primary residence and professional domicile, as well as adopting a new bankruptcy code.

Measures to reduce the tax burden include the abolition of the business tax and a tax-free allowance of 10,000 euros for all.

Measures to reduce production costs and energy costs include reducing excise duty on fuels and financing energy-saving and self-production actions from renewable energy sources.

Measures to ensure access to finance for SMEs include redirecting European resources, particularly those of the Recovery and Resilience Fund, to provide loans and grants for small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the region, not just the center and a few large business groups that can be counted on the fingers of two hands.

With the same objective, we foresee the institutionalization of an SME, Self-Employed, and Farmers' Fund integrated, if you like, "dangled," so to speak, from the Development Bank, with the aim of financing SMEs with working capital, microcredit, commercial and agricultural credit, leasing, and factoring. This is what systemic banks should normally do, but they do not because today 96% of businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises in our country, do not have access to bank loans. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and those in tourism do not have the opportunity to finance their development investment projects from systemic banks.

We also provide a support structure for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Ministry of Economy with the participation of Chambers and their Associations to support them both horizontally and individually. We also aim to promote synergies and clusters with the goal of strengthening them and changing their productive scale and capabilities.

The "problem" for us, friends, is not small and medium-sized enterprises. The problem is the distorted model of development that New Democracy and the big economic interests in the country are promoting. A model of development that condemns small and medium-sized enterprises to the margins and seeks to make the vast majority of them disappear in the end.

The long-term prospects of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship in Greece will be judged in the near future. They will be judged, in particular, by the exploitation of this great opportunity, as I said before. That is why we are setting the use of Community resources, the Resilience and Recovery Fund, and the new NSRF for the next seven years as one of the crucial dilemmas of the ballot box. In total, over EUR 70 billion. The big question is: who and how will manage these resources? Who and how will manage this 70 billion, this great potential, this great opportunity for the country?

The ones who gave over 15 billion in direct awards and closed tenders with total opacity during the pandemic period? They gave the first 600 million of the Recovery Fund loans to 13 large companies, which had access to lending from mainstream banks but at a higher interest rate, and now swapped the interest rate to make a profit. They did not give financing to any small and medium-sized enterprises. We called for a bipartisan committee in Parliament to oversee the allocation of these funds and the management of the 30 billion in the Recovery Fund a year ago, but they refused.

Here is a crucial question for the Greek people, and one of the stakes of the June 25th ballot: Will we leave the management of this great opportunity to those who have proven that they only care about funding the powerful and the rich? Or will we give the country the opportunity to have a perspective of fairness, equity, equality, fair management of these resources, meritocracy, accountability, and control? Those who have proven that they have been throwing a party of opacity during the pandemic.

For New Democracy, this perspective is limited to turning the Fund into a mechanism for further strengthening the few and powerful. We propose redistributing the resources in a fair and targeted manner, spreading them to as many sectors, institutions, and businesses as possible, in order to ensure the long-term prosperity of the entire Greek economy, extroversion, innovation, and healthy competition.

Friends, the message that has been emanating lately from the New Democracy cadres in a very sharp way is a message of arrogance and conceit. For hours on end, they do not hesitate to turn this arrogance and conceit into crude blackmail, terrorism, and intimidation. The message they are sending out is clear: any social group or productive sector that dares to claim a better future and a fairer distribution of the wealth that this country produces - as Mrs Bakoyannis said in Thrace - "will have a hard time in the next four years"! Note this message from Mrs Bakoyannis, your compatriot from Chania. This message was not addressed to the Muslim minority; it was addressed to every home, every family, and every social group. Today it may be Muslims, tomorrow it will be nurses, the day after tomorrow it will be taxi drivers, the day after that it will be teachers, and the day after that it will be tourism workers. Any social group that has a will other than the will of the almighty power of the party and the family will have a hard time.

We are here to say that not every social group can be treated as an internal enemy, and we cannot be led to social automatism. We will be here, and I want to say this from democratic Heraklion. To say that SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, whatever happens, will be here to defend every social group, every social category, to defend democracy. In our country, democracy is and will remain strong. We will be here as a guarantor of democracy, of the rule of law. We will be here to break the fear. Fear will not go away, terror will not go away, intimidation will not go away.

That is why today, I would like to extend an invitation to all democratic citizens, regardless of party preferences and choices, and appeal to them to put a stop to the arrogance of power. Strengthen SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance with your vote on June 25 and take the cause of the reversal of the correlations into your own hands. It is crucial for our lives for the next four years. Fill the electoral map with prefectures in the color of SYRIZA on June 25. Fill the map with the only color that disturbs the arrogance, the omnipotence, the arrogance, the arrogance, the vindictiveness of the Right.

This invitation is addressed to both representatives of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and workers in tourism. Allow me to speak a little - enough should be enough, not a little - about the workers. Tens of thousands of young and older people every year feed the tourism industry with their hard and intensive work.

An industry that, behind the facade of sunny beaches and delicious meals, often - not always, but unfortunately often enough - hides a dystopian reality with exhausting working hours, miserable working conditions, insecurity, and precariousness, incidents of employer arbitrariness, and violation of any labor legislation.

A sector that, despite its central position in the Greek economy, continues to be plagued by the absence of a comprehensive strategic approach to the issue of tourism education. We say that the people who produce the wealth deserve a better life, for without them there is no wealth, and therefore no economy.

And we are proud that during the years of the SYRIZA government, we legislated in their interests, imposed controls, and revived the Labour Inspectorate. We abolished the minimum wage for young people, that racist provision, and we raised the minimum wage as soon as we came out of the memoranda. We defended and safeguarded collective labor agreements.

All of these were withdrawn by the Mitsotakis government, despite the fact that we are outside the memoranda, right after the elections of 2019. I believe that workers in tourism know and can compare. They know in their own skin what, for example, the Hatzidakis law means, what the dismantling of the SEPA means, and what unpaid overtime and individual employment contracts mean.

In our view, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises and tourism workers are not diametrically opposed. They are not even antithetical. Our aim is a regulatory framework that ensures a fair and productive model, allowing for the growth of businesses on the one hand and the security and dignity of the work of their employees on the other.

But to get there, I would say we need to look at the big picture. Working in small and medium-sized enterprises has a particular characteristic that you know very well: the special and sometimes personal relationship between the entrepreneur and the employee. The well-being of one is a necessary condition for the well-being of the other. When there are companies with miserable labor relations that exploit and underpay their workers in a sector or region, they create conditions of unfair competition with all the others. For all of you who know that a healthy market that operates by rules means increased productivity and lower employee turnover, it implies prosperity for all, not just for a powerful few.

On the contrary, the prevalence of the law of the jungle in labor and business creates a vicious circle that has only one result: the inevitable strengthening of large and powerful groups at the expense of both small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and society as a whole. This is the transformation that is taking place today and will be accelerated even more if the results of May 21 are repeated at the ballot box on June 25.

New Democracy is implementing its program to shrink the welfare state, marginalize small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthen the few and powerful, and devalue labor. In short, I would say: to turn our country into a country of cheap growth.

We, on the other hand, say it clearly: We do not want cheap growth. We want growth in the service of the people and the country. We want growth with rules. We want growth and a productive model that will shield the Greek economy and ensure the well-being of all citizens.

We want a just society and prosperity for all. What does our program say? That is what we want. And for that, we need a plan. And for that, we need will. Will for a strong and modern developmental state. I assure you that we have the plan, we have the will, and we will fight to the end to make it happen. I want to make a commitment to you. From whatever position, we will fight to the end together to make it happen. We will fight together. Be well, thank you very much. Goodbye.
