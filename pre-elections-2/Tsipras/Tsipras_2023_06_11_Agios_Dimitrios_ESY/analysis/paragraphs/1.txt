I would like to warmly thank you for your patience in overcoming, above all, the weather difficulties. It seems that someone has cursed us, but we do not complain. It is not a great difficulty to get a little wet, "he who is wet is not afraid of the rain". We are fighting on the front lines and we do not mind getting a little wet.
