4th programmatic commitment: The generous wage upgrade of doctors, as well as other NHS workers. An introductory salary of 2,000 euros will be provided for designated doctors. Otherwise, a young scientist who has spent half their life on the bench and can find a triple or quadruple salary in Cyprus or another country of the European Union will have no reason to join the National Health System. We recognize the need to include nurses in the heavy and unhealthy category and commit to doing so. We acknowledge the need for a new package of incentives (labor, economic, social, educational, scientific development) to attract medical staff to the NHS, with a special focus on hard-to-reach island regions, as well as specialties that are in short supply and lean departments and clinics throughout the country.
