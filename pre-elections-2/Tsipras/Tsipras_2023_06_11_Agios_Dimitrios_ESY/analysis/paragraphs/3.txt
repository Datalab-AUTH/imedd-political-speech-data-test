We should have had three dramatic and extreme incidents last week, but not so random. Three incidents resulted in the deaths of our fellow citizens, which could have been avoided if the ambulance service had been working effectively and meeting the real needs of the population. These incidents brought reality back into focus. And what is the reality? The National Health System is in a state of complete collapse today. This is the truth that all citizens who have contact with the health system, especially those in popular areas, middle, and grassroots, know all too well.
