Withdrawing the state means cutting spending and withdrawing the ability to spend money on healthcare. How will the neoliberal plan of the New Democracy deal with this? They plan to use public-private partnerships, dismantle public structures, and cut costs, even if it means denying expensive medicine to those with a negative prognosis and life expectancy in favor of those with a better prognosis. This is cynicism!
