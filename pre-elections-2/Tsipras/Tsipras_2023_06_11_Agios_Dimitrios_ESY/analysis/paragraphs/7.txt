We shuddered because of what Mr Pneumatikos said. He talked about cost-benefit analysis in terms of medical operations, from which cost-benefit analysis will emerge when we draw the red line between life and death. But that is the extreme neoliberal plan of the New Democracy for healthcare. It is a cynical utilitarianism that ignores the fact that every human being is unique and unrepeatable, has intrinsic value as a person, and cannot be weighed in the balance. We cannot measure their life by economic parameters.
