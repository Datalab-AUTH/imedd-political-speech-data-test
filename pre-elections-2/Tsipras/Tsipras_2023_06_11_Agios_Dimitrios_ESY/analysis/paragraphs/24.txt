Second priority: Investing in the human resources of the NHS, because the NHS is its people, its doctors, and its nurses. These are the people who struggle to save lives in adverse conditions, and I believe that human resources are a critical part. Therefore, reversing the trend of resignation and flight of medical personnel, drastically reducing the brain drain with a framework of remuneration, working conditions, training, and scientific development of young health professionals, will enable them to stay in the country. This will prevent young doctors from leaving abroad, where they can find salaries three or four times higher.
