While we solved an existential issue during the great debt crisis, which was whether we would remain in Europe - or more precisely, whether we would remain in the euro - and we solved it thanks to the bold and difficult, very difficult, and costly political decisions we made in 2015, today the stakes are no longer whether we will stay in Europe, but whether we will become Europe. In other words, whether we will stop this course of divergence and cease to be the tail end of the European family. As long as income continues to shrink and important social infrastructures, particularly public health, are being dismantled, we are drifting away from Europe.
