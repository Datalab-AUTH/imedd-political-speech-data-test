Friends, we have taken the decision once again to focus our attention on what we believe is perhaps one of the most critical issues for the majority of society: the issue of public health. I believe that this is one of the issues that should, if not monopolize, at least be a central issue in the electoral debate in view of the crucial elections on 25 June. I say this because, unfortunately, the previous debate in view of the elections on 21 May, in the context of the simple proportional representation, unfortunately did not focus at all on the major, critical problems that concern and concern the social majority.
