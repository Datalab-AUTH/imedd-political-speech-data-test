We come with a completely different concept. Our concept states that some things in life cannot be sold or bought because they are values in themselves. Health is one of those values that we consider non-negotiable. We have witnessed the impact of the pandemic and its aftermath. I will provide you with one number, as I do not want to overwhelm you with statistics. We have delivered the National Health System with 6,500 more permanent doctors and nurses than it currently has, despite the pandemic crisis and the realization of the Greek society that we need to strengthen the NHS.
