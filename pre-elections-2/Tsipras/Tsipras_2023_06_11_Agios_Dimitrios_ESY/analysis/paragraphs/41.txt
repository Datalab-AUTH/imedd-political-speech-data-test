In fact, the question we have to answer as citizens, as voters, as a society in these elections, is not simply which party we want to govern us, but what kind of society we want. What kind of society do we want our country's future to be? Do we want "a just society with prosperity for all," as our motto says? A society of solidarity and dignity, or do we want a society that will give in to the tendency systematically cultivated by the market and by the media system, so that we end up with a fight of all against all? In what some people call "social automatism."
