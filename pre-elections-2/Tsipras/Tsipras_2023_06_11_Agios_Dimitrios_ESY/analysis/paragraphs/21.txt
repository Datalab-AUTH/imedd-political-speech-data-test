Under the conditions of the memorandum, we abolished Mr Georgiades' five-euro system and ensured full medical and pharmaceutical care for two and a half million uninsured citizens. New Democracy restricted this provision after the memoranda, leaving hundreds of thousands of freelancers and farmers without pharmaceutical coverage from doctors contracted with the Greek National Health Insurance Fund. We also hired 19,000 new staff, despite the memoranda, and started permanent recruitment procedures. We brought the hospitals' finances back to normal, which we handed over for the first time with a real surplus. Today, their current deficit exceeds EUR 1 billion. We strengthened the infrastructure of hospitals with modern machinery and launched the great reform to finally give the country a modern primary health care system, establishing 127 Local Health Units. Mr Mitsotakis was telling us that what we want to build is a Soviet model, as his party used to say about the NHS when it was being established in the 1980s. The New Democracy Party said at the time that it was 'Soviet-style health care' and voted against it.
