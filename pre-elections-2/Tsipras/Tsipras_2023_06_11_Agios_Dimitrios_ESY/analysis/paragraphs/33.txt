6th programmatic commitment: Strengthening the budgets of both the NHS and EOPYY with the ultimate goal of reaching the European average level of health expenditure, which is 7.5%, compared to Greece's current level of 5%. Our priority should be to recruit 700 rescuers for the ambulance service, as they have not been hired despite the hiring of 300 permanent staff during the memorandum period. In the last four years, 560 staff have left and there has not been a single permanent recruitment. Despite this, money was allocated to hire 1,000 police officers for the university police, but not for the ambulance service. Therefore, it is a matter of priorities.
