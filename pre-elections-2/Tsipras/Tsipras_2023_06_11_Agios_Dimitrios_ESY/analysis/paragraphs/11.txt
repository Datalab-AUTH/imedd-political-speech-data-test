So I was saying that I want to give you a number that I think is of great value and importance. In Europe, the average private health expenditure is 15%. In Greece, private health expenditure is 35%. Public health expenditure per capita in Greece is almost twice as low as the European average. What does this mean? That there is a huge room for profit in Greece. Where? In healthcare.
