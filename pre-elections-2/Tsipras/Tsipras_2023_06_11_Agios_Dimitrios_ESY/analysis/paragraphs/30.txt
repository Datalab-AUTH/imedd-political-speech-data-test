3rd programmatic commitment: Addressing the staffing crisis in the NHS with an automatic and permanent mechanism to fill vacancies due to retirement. With regard to contract staff, all contract staff who were on the front line during the pandemic should be granted tenure. This is a moral commitment for us. They were applauded by people on balconies, remember? And later their reward was to have them ready to leave the system altogether. And then came the riot police. First, there was applause on the balconies, and then the carpazzi! That was the evolution. So we have a moral obligation to proceed with the tenure of the people who were on the front line. But beyond that, our plan is to move forward in the four-year period with 15,000 targeted recruitments, new medical specializations, support for scientific research, and a new framework for cooperation between the National Health System and our public universities.
