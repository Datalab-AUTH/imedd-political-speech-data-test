But there is no doubt that if New Democracy wins the next election and becomes the government, this plan will be implemented. Part of this plan was unwittingly revealed by an otherwise excellent scientist, but faithful to neoliberal views and concepts of public health, of health as a whole, Mr. And what is this plan? It is the plan to transform our country's hospitals into Private Legal Entities, to close public structures, to further reduce public spending on healthcare, even on patient screening. And if we did not have time to shudder, as Mr Mitsotakis promised us in Parliament just before the pandemic, announcing his plan for public healthcare on a pilot basis - he said at the time that he would proceed with the public-private partnership in three large public hospitals - even if we did not have time to shudder then, we shudder now when we hear these statements.
