These are the programmatic commitments of SYRIZA on Health for the next four years, dear friends. However, I want to conclude by saying a few words about the battle for public health. The battle for public health is not a trench battle, a defensive battle, or a battle to preserve acquisitions. It is a mistake to view it in that way. In my opinion, it is a battle of horizons and perspectives, but it is also taking on the character of an existential battle nowadays.
