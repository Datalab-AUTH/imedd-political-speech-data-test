But on the other hand, to be honest, isn't that what the New Democracy government did during the pandemic and immediately afterwards? While we, as a country and as a society, had the fiscal capacity, as I said before, but also the political obligation, I would say, to support the National Health System and to use long-term investments to exploit the possibility of overcoming its pathogenesis, after a decade-long crisis that left the health system badly damaged. But the choice that was made was not, I repeat, when the potential was there. The choice was to turn the National Health System into a single disease system, without even adequate support in terms of staff and infrastructure. With the obvious aim of favouring the private health sector and, in particular, certain large medical-hospital market interests.
