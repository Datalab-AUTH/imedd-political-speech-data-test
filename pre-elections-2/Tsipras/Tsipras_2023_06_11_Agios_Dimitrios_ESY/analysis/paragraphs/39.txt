The twelfth programmatic commitment, but not the last, is our commitment to a National Health Infrastructure Plan for the gradual upgrade of facilities and equipment in the National Health System. This will be achieved through a special financial instrument provided by the Recovery and Resilience Fund, NSRF programmes, the European Investment Bank, and, of course, the Public Investment Programme.
