5th programmatic commitment: The completion of the reform of Primary Health Care, and in particular, the institution of the family doctor, with high priority given to strengthening public structures such as Health Centres, Local Health Units, and Regional Clinics. This will be achieved by setting up additional Local Health Units throughout the country, reaching a total of 380, and by using private family doctors under contract with EOPYY as a subsidiary measure. We also recognize the need to network public Primary Health Care structures with the social services of municipalities and community mental health structures, in the context of integrated health and psychosocial care, with a focus on the community and a shift towards prevention and health promotion.
