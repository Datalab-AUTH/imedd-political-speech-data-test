About two years ago, if I remember correctly, during the second lockdown, we organized a big event at that time - without people, of course. Through the internet, we had contact with the citizens. We presented our positions on the new National Health System and the need to transition to a new, strong health system. I went back to my notes from that event and found that I had said the following verbatim: "The image of a healthcare system has gone far beyond its limits, and if it holds up, it holds up because of the superhuman efforts of its people. That image no one can refute."
