I was saying that two years ago, back when no one dared to come out and say that this is the program. Unfortunately, I was confirmed to the hilt. Immediately after the end of the pandemic, the great reform began. The transformation of hospitals into legal entities under private law began, the full and exclusive employment of NHS doctors was abolished, and the institutional conditions for the invasion of private interests in the health sector were created. And just today, Mr Mitsotakis, instead of apologizing for this whole picture, the state of the NHS after four years of his government, has just blurted out that he is thinking of supposedly solving the problem of the EKAV. How? By hiring private helicopters from abroad to come in and do evacuations. Careful, this is not a joke. It's a method: first, we devalue and then we start handing out contractors.
