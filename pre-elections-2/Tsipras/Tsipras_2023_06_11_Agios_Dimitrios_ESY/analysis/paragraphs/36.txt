9th programmatic commitment: It concerns the reduction of health care inequalities between the Centre and the Region, which we refer to as the "Health Equivalent", particularly for island regions. This entails providing special incentives to attract doctors to arid, inaccessible, island areas, as well as introducing a "Health Equivalent" to compensate citizens for services they need to travel outside their place of residence to access. It is a crucial vision for our island citizens, following the transport parity vision that we have already realized, with the special contribution of our late comrade Nektarios Santoriniou.
