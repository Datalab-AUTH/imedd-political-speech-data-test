7th programmatic commitment: The drastic reduction of private healthcare spending. I have made a parenthesis at the beginning to explain the difference between the European average and what is happening in our country. How will this happen? Through the reduction of co-payments for medicines and increased coverage of needs that are borne by households (such as laboratory tests, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, dental care, dedicated nurses, special education, etc.), either through public structures or through additional benefits from the EOPYY. It is the synergy of state and social security resources that can guarantee universal and equitable health coverage in practice.
