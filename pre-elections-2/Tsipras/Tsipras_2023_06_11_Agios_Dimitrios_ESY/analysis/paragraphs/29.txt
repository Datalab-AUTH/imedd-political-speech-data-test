Programmatic commitment 2: We discuss the necessity of creating new public services for citizens. No villager should be without guaranteed coverage for their modern health needs. This includes Primary Health Care, family doctor home and community care, emergency medical rehabilitation, mental health, oncology care, oral health, occupational medicine, geriatric care, palliative care, and assisted reproduction. We give particular attention to a number of critical issues that concern society as a whole.
