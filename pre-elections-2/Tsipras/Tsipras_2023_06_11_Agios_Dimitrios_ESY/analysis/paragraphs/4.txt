Each and every one of us, especially during the pandemic period and afterwards, has been to a public hospital and has witnessed this collapse. Perhaps this image of collapse is not present in other suburbs of Athens, where they have the financial means to access private health services. But those of us who live in the real world and not in a parallel universe know what the situation is in public hospitals. The NHS has almost collapsed. Let me say that this was a conscious choice. New Democracy decided not to increase public spending on the NHS, while all over Europe budgetary commitments and constraints were lifted precisely for this reason.
