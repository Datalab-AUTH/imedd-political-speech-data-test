We have answered this dilemma, and that is why we are sticking to our answer: we choose the first one - a society of prosperity for all and a society of solidarity. We insist on the former, despite the ideologues of pessimism and the 'naturalness' of social inequalities. Because we are told that "inequalities are natural," but we say no - inequalities are not a natural phenomenon. Equality, justice, and solidarity are natural phenomena. That is a natural phenomenon. This society of widening inequalities is a monstrosity. We will continue the struggle for equality and justice without compromise and without giving up. And we will continue this struggle, no matter what it takes, no matter what happens, until we win it. Be well, thank you very much.
