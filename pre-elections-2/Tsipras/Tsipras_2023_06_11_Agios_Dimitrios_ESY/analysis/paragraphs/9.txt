I want you to hold back a number because I often like to say that one of the national goals that the country should have for the next four years, or even the next decade, is to converge and stop diverging from the European average. Since 2009, the beginning of the crisis, the country has been losing ground. This is clearly shown in the comparison of the country's ability to generate per capita income. In 2007, the country was at 77% of the European average in terms of income per capita, but in 2022, it has fallen to 59%. We are moving away from Europe and have been surpassed by countries that were once below us.
