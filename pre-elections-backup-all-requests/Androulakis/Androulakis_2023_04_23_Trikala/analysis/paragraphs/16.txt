And they were saying, don't pay seismicity, we are coming and you won't pay anything seismicity on red loans and after a year of deceiving the Greek people, Mr Tsipras passes a law and hands over billions of red loans of farmers, farmers, farmers, cooperatives, small and medium enterprises to the crows of the funds. So we as a patriotic movement have only one goal. To put the plan to de-fund the Greek economy on the sidelines and protect all Greeks so that they have a second chance of dignity and can settle their loans in a fair way. We are not saying that the strategic defaulters should be burned together with the dry and the green, but the people who are being blackmailed by the funds, who took the loans at 5, 10, 15% of the value, are another. And they're not interested in the growth of the Greek economy, but to speculate a little bit more. So we have another plan, so we want all the negotiations to be transparent over the table, as it would be with the banking system, and of course what kind of state do we envision?
