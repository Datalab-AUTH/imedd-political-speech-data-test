So today, does Mr Mitsotakis think he can hide his executive failure? The grave affront to institutions, the widening of social inequalities, the reduction of citizens' purchasing power and job insecurity does not call for a positive vote for the work it does. He goes all over Greece and spreads the scarecrow of Mr. Tsipras' governance and says. Vote for me because they're coming. So I say, from Trikala, vote PASOK so that neither of the two will come. He even has the nerve. And yesterday from my homeland, Crete.
