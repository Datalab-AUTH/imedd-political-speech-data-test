That already in Europe they are discussing a large part of the ETS after 2030 to pay for houses and cars. But who have the most energy-intensive homes and cars in Greece and Europe? But the poorer Europeans and the poorer Greeks, what are we going to tell them then? That they didn't know that in 2023 from Trikala I was saying that all parties should commit to a green transition and social justice for all Greeks and not cry over the broken bones after 2030, as they did with the memoranda.

And this party has a duty to talk about the future. A society that does not see the future and that does not take decisions that shield it and make it resilient is vulnerable to all international developments. It is no accident, friends. After Lehman Brothers in 2007, PASOK executives said, take measures to Karamanlis, he didn't take measures and we ended up with memoranda.
