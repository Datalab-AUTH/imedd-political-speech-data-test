We in PASOK want a strong and fair Greece in Europe and in the world and we will make this non-existent through our struggle in the next 4 weeks for all Greeks. We hold on to our best traditions, our patriotic DNA, our historic struggles for democracy and social justice and our unparalleled work on infrastructure and the rule of law. The welfare state, health and education, the national health system created by George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos, the Public Education system that your children and your grandchildren will have. They were the ones who for many, many years could study in Greek universities, become doctors, lawyers. The child of the farmer, the farmer's child and to achieve more in life than previous generations, we are the party, the progressive, patriotic party of European social democracy. Friends, with a strong PASOK on 21 May we are opening a new page for young people and new generations.
