Establishment of the right of option for borrowers to purchase their loan before it is transferred to funds. Protecting the borrower of the 80,000 families of the Swiss franc by limiting to 1/3 their liability for their change, the exchange rate change and 2/3 that the interest rate is borne by the banking institution. Limits on the profitability of funds for viable arrangements to borrowers, as they buy loans at 15 and 20% and sell them at 80 and 90. Substantive negotiations with banks and measures to eliminate and prevent increases in interest rates on loans to weak households. And, of course, a reduction in banks' profit margins for consistent borrowers. I say this because some will say?
