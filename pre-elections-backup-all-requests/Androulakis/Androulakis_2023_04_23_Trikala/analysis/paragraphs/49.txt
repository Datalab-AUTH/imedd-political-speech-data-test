So we have made a decision and we are in debt every day with our action. To certify that we are not all the same. I am not the same as Mr Tsipras or Mr Mitsotakis. We have no relations. We have no connection with the creation of digital gangs and digital parastate that divides the Greek people and which was created with our taxes during their years of government by both Mr Tsipras and now Mr Mitsotakis. Do you know? It's another thing. Speak the language of truth? It is another thing to say, like Mr Tsipras, that we are with the victim of abuse. And at the same time. Thousands of accounts drinking water in your name and its executives, like someone here in Thessaly, trying to discredit a woman who had the courage to report abuse.
