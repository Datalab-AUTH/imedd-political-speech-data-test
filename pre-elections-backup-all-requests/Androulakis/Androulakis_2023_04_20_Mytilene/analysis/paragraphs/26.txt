Today I raised from your island the big issue of refugee migration and the minister responsible dared to give a false answer, saying that I should find out why Greece is participating in a matter that is trying to revise Dublin. I want to inform him that Greece has been participating in this forum long before the government of Mr Mitsotakis. So what do they want us to applaud them for not withdrawing from the forum discussing and supporting the Dublin review? You know, populism is not only without a tie, it is also with a tie and a collar, as the government of the New Democracy proves.
