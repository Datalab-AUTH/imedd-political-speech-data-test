How many thousands of workers are missing from the Greek economy? Is there an immigration policy or are we at one extreme? Anyone want to come to the other extreme where we have a hollow immigration policy? So we want a policy that is about borders and European reforms, but also has a real immigration policy, so that we can deal with the huge shortage of workers that our country has in certain sectors. If this does not happen immediately, the country's growth will be undermined. In too many areas of Greece the fruit on the trees is rotting due to the lack of farm workers.
