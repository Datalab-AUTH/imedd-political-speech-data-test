Another huge issue for us is the cost of living in terms of housing. That's why we have proposed a comprehensive Recovery Fund program that will create a pool of 150,000 homes across Greece with tax incentives with reconstruction incentives from European programs to open up homes, to reconstruct them, to build new ones from the Recovery Fund and so through this pool 150,000 families will have access to low-cost housing. Decent housing.
