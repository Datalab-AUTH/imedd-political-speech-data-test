To say that it is in the priority of borrower protection. When the party that managed to protect the Greek people's first home with a memorandum during the first period of the toughest negotiations. I hear some people saying yes, it's not Mr Tsipras' fault that he handed over billions of euros of red loans in 2015. To foreign funds, because the lenders were pressuring him, he says. Sorry, the pressures were stronger in 2015 and not in the 2 2010-15 and a half percent external deficit that Mr. Karamanlis handed us. Did Mr.Tsipras, the Prime Minister of the so-called Seisachthia, finally lead our country to a huge negotiation watterloo that we are paying too dearly for today and the worst of all is that he is unrepentant? And he exploited the social deadlocks that Karamanlis created for the Greek people and he takes the executives of Mr.Karamanlis and presents them to us as the saviours of the next day and not if this is the left, then we have a greater duty to strengthen the democratic party so that the country can have a real centre-left and not the left. Ally of Mr. Karamanlis.
