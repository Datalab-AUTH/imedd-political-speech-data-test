The taxes of the middle class and the weakest Greek citizens. You know, a lot of times he just talks about it. But forget what happened to the Greek people's money that was invested in stabilizing the banking system and which was annihilated in the summer of 2015. I say this because we are all now very well known for our choices on the economy and for our easy big talk, but also for our choices on major national issues. Mr Mitsotakis and a huge opportunity in 2019. As he said before the elections, he said that the country should change its page, that there should be respect for the institutions, that we should not experience fake referendums again, that we should not experience a policy that exposes the country abroad. But I want to tell you how many times the foreign media have dealt with the government of Mr. Mitsotakis was it ever for anything good? It was a good bugging state because it didn't allow the justice system to do its job.
