Does Mr. Karamanlis finally have responsibilities? Who is the one who did not take the file of the independent transparency authority and take it to the Greek justice system? Who is the one who covered up another scandal with results? A year and a half later Greece has to live through this tragedy. And of course, who are the people who made an illegal transfer to put in place a gentleman who apparently did not meet the necessary requirements? Potential he should have had for this position.
