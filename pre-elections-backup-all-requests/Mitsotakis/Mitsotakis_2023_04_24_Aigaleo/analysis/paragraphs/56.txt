We and I personally start this struggle with two assets: the truth agreement, which we are renewing and updating, and the work we have achieved. In this struggle I ask you to become the protagonists. Explain to each of our fellow citizens the much that has been done and the much more that needs to be done. We must not risk our conquests, we must not discount our claims.
