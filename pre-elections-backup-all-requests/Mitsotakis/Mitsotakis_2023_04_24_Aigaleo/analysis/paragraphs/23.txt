We have abolished queues.  But, as you well know, in this so-called state there is still a double reality. The good aspects of the state must prevail over the bad. "112" is also a state. The state is the EMAK, the border guards, the members of the Armed Forces who flew to rescue the Greeks from Sudan. The state is the police, the ambulance is by our side in every danger. The state we want is the new EFKA, which pays out pensions on time. And of course it is the same state, the one we want, the one that called 120,000 Greek women to have free screening mammograms.
