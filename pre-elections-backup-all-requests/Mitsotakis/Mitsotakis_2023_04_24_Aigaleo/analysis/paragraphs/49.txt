I personally don't believe anything they say. After all, they said one thing and did another in the "referendum of the bloody plebiscite". They proclaimed at the time that they would not hold new elections and they did. They pledged that they would remain firm in their positions and then they allied themselves with the extreme right wing of Kamenos. Just as I don't trust anyone who refuses to accept as Prime Minister the leader of the party that the people have voted for. So, again, they have no principles.
