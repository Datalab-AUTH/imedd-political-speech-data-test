Young Democrats of Egaleo and West Athens, thank you for this impressive reception. I return to you the joy, the emotion and the enthusiasm that your presence here today expresses. A big thank you to our youth, a warm round of applause for the young people of New Democracy and for the many "timeless" Onnedites who are among us. Our first big pre-election rally in Attica could not be held anywhere else but here, in Egaleo, in my constituency. I met some old friends on the way in. You may remember that I made my first political appearance here in Egaleo exactly 20 years ago, in April 2003. Since then you have surrounded me with your trust. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
