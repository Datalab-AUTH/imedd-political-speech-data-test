With investments exceeding 100 million. We will have a total of 2,000 employees, most of them working here in West Athens. While we sanctified and resolved the "Gordian knot" of the Skaramanga shipyards, where 700 more recruitments are expected. Proof that the whole of society can share in the country's development. A second proof: the plan to finance the Aghia Varvara Hospital, a personal bet of mine, so that it can operate independently of Attikon and the General Hospital of Nice. With new services, with day surgeries, a rehabilitation centre, a palliative care department, but also with primary health care units that will emphasise prevention. So you see, a lot has happened in these four years on the west side of the capital. And from the Philodemos and Tritsis programmes alone, we have 120 million euros in total for the seven municipalities of Western Attica.
