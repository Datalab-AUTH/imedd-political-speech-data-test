From the Western Sector, then, and from its seven municipalities, I start our struggle - municipalities that I know very well, I have walked them for 20 years, Agia Varvara, Agioi Anargyros, Kamatero, Egaleo, Ilion, Peristeri, Petroupoli, Haidari - so that this area becomes the starting point of our victorious journey. The one that on May 21 will bring what the whole country is expecting, a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. To finally close the door to the past and open it wide to the future. All of Greece will turn blue on May 21st. I see, friends, that perhaps we should have chosen another venue, the indoor stadium in the city does not fit us all.
