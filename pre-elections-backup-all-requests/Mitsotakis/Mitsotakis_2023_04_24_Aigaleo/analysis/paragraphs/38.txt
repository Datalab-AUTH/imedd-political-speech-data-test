Here, for our students, let me remind them that he introduced sledgehammers in universities. We are with the libraries, not the sledgehammers. Worse, it pushed the country to the margins of Europe. I believe that this is what has ultimately hurt us all the most, to feel that we are a country without dignity, a beggar in Europe, constantly asking and pleading. However, SYRIZA also seemed incapable of opposition. He said - and hold that back for your own political sake - "no" to everything and "yes" to nothing. No to tax cuts, no to raising the minimum wage, no to armaments, no to defence agreements, no to the Evros fence. Watch out, not even for the rights of our fellow citizens with disabilities, and not even for the protection of the Parliament from the "straw men" of Golden Dawn.
