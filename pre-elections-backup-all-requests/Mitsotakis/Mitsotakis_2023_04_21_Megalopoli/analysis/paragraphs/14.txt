We are much more experienced today than we were four years ago. I will reiterate that we have mobilized very important European resources to be able to implement our plan for the Greece we envision. And we ask the Greek citizens to give us this opportunity to continue the work that we have started. Greece could not change in four years, but much has changed and much more can change. We have given the writing samples. Our credentials to the Greek citizens, as I said, are our credibility, our consistency, our honesty, that we will always speak the language of truth.
