But it is a commitment of mine - and I want you to know this and I want you to have heard it from me - that the next four years, if the Greek people trust us, will be a four-year period in which our attention will be focused even more intensively on those areas of the country that de facto need care as electricity production from lignite will decline. Megalopolis, here, the region of Ptolemaida, the region of Western Macedonia, have secured the maximum possible subsidies and funding. This will de facto attract other kinds of investors who will come here to Megalopolis. Always in consultation with the Region - and with the resources of the Region and national resources - we can plan with you a future for Megalopolis that will be more optimistic, that will be brighter. I am not going to allow under any circumstances, in this overall vision of development that I have for the country, that there are regions that feel that they are lagging behind for historical reasons and cannot participate in this effort.
