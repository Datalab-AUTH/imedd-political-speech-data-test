The conditions and international circumstances are still very difficult. You see that we live in a world of constant turmoil, with a neighbour who has been very nervous for 3.5 years now. Right now, yes, the climate is better, but who can guarantee that this will continue the next day, after the Greek and Turkish elections? What is needed first and foremost is a stable government with a strong popular mandate. Under no circumstances should we get involved in adventures of instability, in governments of "cooperation", which will be the result of compromises and agreements made in some dark rooms. This does not serve the national interest today. I am not sure things will get any easier, we will need an experienced crew to keep the ship of Greece stable in the troubled waters we are sailing and I imagine we will continue to sail in the years to come.
