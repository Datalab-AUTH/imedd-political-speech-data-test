The business tax will be abolished within the next four years, as tax compliance of all those who are currently required to pay a tax which, because it is horizontal, is also unfair. So we will continue this policy of tax reduction, we will continue the policy of supporting investment, we will continue the policy of strengthening and strengthening Greece in a troubled neighbourhood. We will continue to protect our borders and despite all those who fight to the contrary, the fence on the Evros is being extended with or without European funds. It is really sad, ladies and gentlemen, that today there are some opposition MEPs who are fighting in the European Parliament not to finance this fence with European funds. All of us, the Greek taxpayers, should pay for a project that is necessary not only for Greece, but for Europe as a whole.
