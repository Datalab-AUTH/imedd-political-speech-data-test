Friends, neo-democrats from Chania and Crete, I always say that I prefer comparison to confrontation with our opponents. But there is an opposition to our own dense work and the clear objectives I just mentioned. Let's see what this opposition is. Four years of Syriza opposition, four years now, no to everything and yes to nothing. Look, no to defence agreements, no to national armaments, no to the Evros fence, no to investment, no to tax cuts. No, also, watch out - and I have a particular sensitivity about this - not on the rights of citizens with disabilities.
