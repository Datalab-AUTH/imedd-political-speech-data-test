I want you to imagine a government of SYRIZA - PASOK - Varoufakis, the same Varoufakis who now says again that he will close the banks again, with Tsipras as Prime Minister and in exchange for the permanent use of proportional representation. A double objective of their own, but a double disaster for Greece. A possibility, not very likely, but under certain conditions.
