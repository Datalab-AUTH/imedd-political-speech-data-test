 And it is this prospect of hope that I ask you today to make real with the struggle we are starting. Explaining to every citizen the much that has been done, the much more that needs to be done, without, for God's sake, jeopardising our conquests, but without compromising our claims. By listening to the voice of society, by recognising our weaknesses, but also by changing the country, we change with the country. That's how we become better, that's how we become more experienced.
