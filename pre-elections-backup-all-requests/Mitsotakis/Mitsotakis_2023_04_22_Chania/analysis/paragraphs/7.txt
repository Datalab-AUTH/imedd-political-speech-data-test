When I spoke again here in Chania, before the July 19 elections, let me remind you a little bit of what I had committed myself to. What I told you we want to do. I told you that I want to reduce taxes and contributions, to boost the income of Greeks, to secure our borders, to unite society, and to upgrade Greece abroad. So the question is: did we do all this? The answer is: yes, we did.
