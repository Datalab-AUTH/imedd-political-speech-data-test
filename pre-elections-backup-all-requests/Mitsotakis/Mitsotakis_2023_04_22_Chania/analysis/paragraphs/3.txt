Our electoral journey officially begins, with Chania becoming the starting point of a course that will determine the entire future of the country. I could not, therefore, have started this journey from any other place. Neither my heart nor my mind would leave me. But I'm sure that's what Konstantinos Mitsotakis would want. But also Marika Mitsotaki, who, believe me, I feel them among us today, inspiring our struggle with the same, always, passion for Crete and Greece. Friends, your bright faces, your smiles, your flags mean a lot to me. Your voice, especially the voice of our youth, is spreading across the sea from coast to coast in our homeland.
