I don't want to talk about the many projects, about the construction site that we have turned the country into, about the reforms that we have brought, about the fact that this Parliament that is being dissolved today, look, it passed 423 laws. Keep one thing from our meeting today: consistency of words and deeds. The guarantee in our new agreement, which tomorrow will become reality and what we are planning will become reality. But also hold together the essence of our new government programme. We will have the opportunity to present it in detail on Wednesday.
