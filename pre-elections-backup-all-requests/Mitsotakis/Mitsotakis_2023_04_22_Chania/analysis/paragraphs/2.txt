It is an important day, as earlier I met with the President of the Republic, launching the dissolution of the Parliament and the announcement of elections on May 21. Elections that we will win, that New Democracy will win. In other words, completing our first four years, as I had committed myself from the beginning, so that we can prove, in this way, that we mean what we say. As our work shows, we are trying to put into practice what we agree with the citizens. So as of now, as of today, as I speak to you, the Presidential Decree of dissolution is being deposited in Parliament.
