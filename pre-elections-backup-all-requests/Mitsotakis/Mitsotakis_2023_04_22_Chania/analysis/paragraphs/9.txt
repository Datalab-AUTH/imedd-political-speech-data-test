We have lightened the shoulders of citizens and the backs of businesses with a burden of 7 billion. This year, some 1.6 million pensioners saw increases of close to 8% for the first time in 12 years. And those who are wronged, since you mentioned Mr. Katrougalos, those who are still wronged by the personal difference Katrougalos were supported with 200-300 euros. I pledge that we will continue to support these pensioners until the Katrougalos personal difference is finally erased. And not only.
