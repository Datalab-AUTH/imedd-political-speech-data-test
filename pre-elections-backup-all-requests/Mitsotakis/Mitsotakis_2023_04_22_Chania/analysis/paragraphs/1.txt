Thank you, my patriots, Chaniots, neo-democrats of Crete. I repay you for the great love you show me today. I expected, of course, that there would be many of us in our old harbour, but I did not imagine that even that would seem small compared to today's impressive gathering. You know well that it is from here, from my roots, that I always draw strength. Your enthusiasm becomes my courage and it is the spirit of Crete that arms me with optimism to make a better tomorrow for our generation and the next one. Friends, I did not choose to be on our island on this day by chance.
