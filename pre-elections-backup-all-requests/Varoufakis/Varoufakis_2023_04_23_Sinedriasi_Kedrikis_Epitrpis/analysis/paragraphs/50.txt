It's an ideal system that gives degrees of fiscal freedom to the eurozone member states, a system that should be in place to strengthen our position here in the euro, which at the same time, if in the event of a banking crisis banks close down, either on their own, like Credit Suisse, or because Draghi closed them down, they reduce the cost of such a bank run. And thirdly, if you need, if you need a national currency, the DEMITRA system can be the basis on which you can easily and cheaply build a national currency, if you need it. Here they start screaming and screaming, burning us.
