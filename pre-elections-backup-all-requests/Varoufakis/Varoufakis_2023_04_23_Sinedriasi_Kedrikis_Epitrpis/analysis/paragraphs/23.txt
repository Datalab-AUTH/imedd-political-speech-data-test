Georgiades and others who went out and advised people to pull their money out of the banks to support the bank run? They were begging the vasta Gerouns to close our banks so that a government that dared to say No to the privatisation of everything, even for 15 minutes, would fall. No to the abolition of the ESAS. No to 24% VAT. No to tax prepayments. This is their life and their state.
