The United States has imposed on the European Union that we open our arms to Ukraine, I am not judging, I am reporting, I am recording, which you know what it means. It means that the European Rural Economic Policy is coming to an end. There is not enough money for the farmers of the Ukrainian and Polish state either. So you see they are dividing the working farmers. No longer North-South but East-West.
