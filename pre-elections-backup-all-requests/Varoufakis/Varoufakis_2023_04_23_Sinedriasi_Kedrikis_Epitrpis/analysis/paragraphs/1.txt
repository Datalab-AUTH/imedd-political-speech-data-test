These are good days, difficult, hard days, election campaign, but these are good days, because this is not just an election campaign, it is being built in the context of the elections, the elections are the incubator, they are the incubator of what is being built, which is the new great Left that this country needs. We have shown all this time what selflessness means, what setting aside the ego means, and that is where the alliance for rupture came from. We are not just talking about the entry of MPs from the MP25 Alliance for Rixi, who will be many more than last time. We are talking about the creation of the disobedient, disobedient, selfless, selfless, adamant, fighting left, as a great party which will not simply bring back with more demands from itself, the "no" to the House of Hellenes and Hellenic Women, but will build a completely different path, building a party and at the same time carving a road, which we will all walk together.
