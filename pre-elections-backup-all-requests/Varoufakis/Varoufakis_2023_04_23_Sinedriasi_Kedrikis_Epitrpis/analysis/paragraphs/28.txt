For them to be so alarmed that they say such nonsense. Of course, that's what you get if you name the oligarchs in parliament who pull their strings. Explaining, as we did before with the example of the DEDDIE, the shenanigans that they are pulling, and explaining them to the Greek people, who, if they listen to what we are saying, understand what happened. That's why they want to create a cacophony, a noise, a demonization, a black propaganda, so that the voice of MP25, our explanation of what their bosses are doing, what the shareholders of Mitsotakis SA are doing, does not reach the ears of the Greek citizens. Of course the lie does not stop at the borders of the official right, PASOK, if Andreas Papandreou sees from where this PASOK of Mr. Androulakis you can be sure that they are being broken down every day. But there are now some circles within SYRIZA that are flowing towards PASOK, not only have they themselves been smeared, but they are flowing towards PASOK, who are suggesting on some TV panels that MERA is playing with the drachma. We will not let them mislead our members, our officers, our candidates, nor the people.
