Friends, with these thoughts, you are candidates, you are candidates, remember what ... how I started? These are good days, enjoy them, have a good time. Because it is beautiful to convey the message of MERA25-Alliance for Rixi to the people out there, who do not know our message, who need it very much and who will understand how much they need it when you explain it. Enjoy our demonisation, it is proof that we are on the right track. The elections, I will say it once again, are only one stop on a long path towards the creation of the unyielding, selfless, disobedient, fighting Left that we are all building together today and here in this Central Committee. Thank you very much.
