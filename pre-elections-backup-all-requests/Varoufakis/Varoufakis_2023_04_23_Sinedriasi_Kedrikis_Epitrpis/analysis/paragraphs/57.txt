I remember that the Greek people stood up and with 62% said no to Draghi's terrorism, to the terrorism of the channels. Is it possible to have such a DIMITRA system?  Of course it is possible. We can't have anything else. The Greek state is bankrupt, it cannot support the banking system. The banking system does not produce liquidity, it charges you, it charges us huge gouge fees to pay with our money for their zero cost. You know, when you make an electronic transaction, you have a coffee from an Everest, from a Gregory's, and you pay for it with your card, they charge you, you know, they charge the shopkeeper. Do you know what the cost of this electronic transaction is? Zero.
