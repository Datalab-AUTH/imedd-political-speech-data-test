Patriotism for us, the left-wing Greeks, the patriots of this country, is to be out there, to protest, to demonstrate against our governments. This is patriotism. The same applies to our Europeanism. Do you know what Europeanism means? Not to say yes to everything and "vasta Geroun", but to go against the directorates and the troikas that are destroying Europe. Because this establishment, which every European progressive must come into direct support and conflict with, this establishment in the name of Europe systematically divides Europeans. As soon as the banks collapse, the Franco-German banks collapse and the euro crisis starts, of course here in Greece, before it goes to Germany, France, Spain, Spain, Italy everywhere.
