Lord Byron. The philhellenes who came here and bled, killed, wept, sweated and sweat to fight with us against the sacred alliance of the then Troika. There has always been the Troika and there have always been fighters against the Troika.We are with all Europeans who are fighting against the Troika.I will not forget the first Eurogroup that I went to in early February 2015.That day thousands of Greeks gathered in Syntagma Square. To support what we were trying to do that day at that Eurogroup. It was moving, but you know what was more moving?
