Now what else are they saying? People, you will lose the euros you have deposited in the banks if you vote for MP25. Just think, they dare to tell the people that they will lose their savings, who? Those who forced the people to spend whatever savings they had to live on over the years. The people who see the IRS seizing their bank accounts. Through the bank accounts they take from the poor every penny they have. Are they talking about deposit insurance?
