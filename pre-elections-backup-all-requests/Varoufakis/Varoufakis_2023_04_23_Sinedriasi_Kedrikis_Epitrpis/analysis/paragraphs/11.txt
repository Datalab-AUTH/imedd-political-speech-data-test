Do you know what DEDDIE will do with the help of RAE and Mitsotakis SA from 1 May, but retroactively from 1 January? It will increase the unit fixed charge for our homes and shops from 52 cents per kilowatt hour to â‚¬4.4. That's an increase of 752%. What other party says all this? Have you heard any other party say all this? Which other party has made red loans, Hercules, auctions its flag from the beginning? From the first day we were founded, it has been our language to warn the Greek people of the plunder that is coming. To propose a bill for Odysseus to replace Hercules and clean up this muck. Shall we add a few more elements? Intrum Hellas.
