We are proud of both the technocratic excellence of the DEMITRA system and the fact that we have the political courage to put it forward and in the face of demonisation in the face of fake news to stand up and say, yes we will do it, you like it, you don't like it. You don't like it, but we'll do it. When you are asked these questions, because as a candidate it will be the first question you will be asked either in a radio interview, television interview, newspaper interview, maybe in the street.
