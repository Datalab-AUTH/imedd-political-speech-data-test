The Economist, Author and former member of the political secretariat of Syriza Christos Laskos, who in 2015 resigned with us and set sail for our common resistance to the "leftist" memoranda and finally, our beloved Syntenko, the legendary Lyraris from Anogia, our heartfelt friend and comrade, Psarantonis, who, as in 2019, occupies symbolically, but as substantially as possible, the honorary position of our State ballot.MER25 Alliance for Rixi. It is the State ballot paper that sets the tone that confirms what I told you at the beginning that these are good days, with Psarantonis Xylouris closing the State ballot paper, with Sofia Sakorafa starting it. The other thirteen in between, I think, demonstrate the long journey we have already made and the even longer journey we will make from today.The messages, fellow travellers, comrades, comrades, friends from all over Greece are overwhelming, from Nea Smyrni, from Rhodes, where we were yesterday, the day before yesterday, from Thessaloniki, from all corners of Greece, a world that had been defeated, a world that felt hurt, that hid in its shell after the capitulation of 2015, that magnificent world of no,   has been reinvigorated, even people who do not follow MP25, even people who do not follow Popular Unity, who are not in the groups and movements that have joined the Alliance for Rupture, they see people who are putting aside their egos, they see people who are creating a frontal united movement and they are reinvigorated and coming to our ranks. Some more bravely, others more timidly, some less sceptical, others more sceptical, but little by little they come and so the great militant Left that was so lacking in this country is being built and will continue to be built after the elections. That is why I think it is something very positive that we should applaud, embrace and give us great joy and satisfaction. The black propaganda of the system against us has started again.We are happy about it, we love their hatred and their lies, because it means that we are doing something good. The hits below the waist prove that we are really on the right track.
