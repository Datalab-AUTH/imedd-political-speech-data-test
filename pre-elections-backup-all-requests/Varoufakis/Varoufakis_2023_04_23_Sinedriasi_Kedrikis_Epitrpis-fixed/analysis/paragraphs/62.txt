Mitsotakis has shown that there is one thing he vetoes the EU for: the interests of shipowners when it comes to the ban on transporting Putin's oil. For the shipowners we have no problem, they broke with the EU, when we say break with the EU to stop the looting through the auctions, ahhh you blew up Europe, Greece into being anti-European, yes.Friends, not to belabor this point any further, it is clear that we are not touched by this fake news or demonization, and they do not even have, and in the final analysis, let me make a political assessment now, they do not even target MERA25-Alliance for Rupture so much, they have understood that we will do well. The pressure is going towards SYRIZA, do you know what they are asking for right now? they are asking Alexis Tsipras and the leadership of SYRIZA to make a statement that they will never cooperate with MERA25, this is what the oligarchy is asking, "they are going for drachma", "they are going to close the banks", "you are going to cooperate with them"? the pressure is on them. Of course, the leadership of SYRIZA has no desire to cooperate with us as we do with them, it is clear that the rupture between us is final, since they have given land and water to the oligarchs.  Since they didn't come to talk to us about red loans, about the energy exchange, about taxation, about energy, about the green transition, about nothing.
