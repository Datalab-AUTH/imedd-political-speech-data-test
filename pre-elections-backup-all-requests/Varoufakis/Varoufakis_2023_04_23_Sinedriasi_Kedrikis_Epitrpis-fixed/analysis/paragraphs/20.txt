The surplus is not good. If we had a stand, a business, a family, surplus is good, it means you have a profit or you put something aside. But when you are a state and you have a surplus, that means a deficit for the people. Because one euro of surplus for the state means that it took from the people and did not use it for public health or education, but gave it to the Troika and the lenders, or borrowed it to give benefits to Mytilineos, Latsis, Vardinoyannis, through the energy exchange, with all these IOUs they call passes. The market pass, the fuel pass, what is all that?
