every time people like us propose the minimum that should and can be done within the EU, within the European framework, you propose, for example, to move VAT from 24 to 19, to 15. Anything, on red loans, something that's consistent with the European framework, the moment you suggest that, they put the tape, we'll kick you out of the euro if you insist. So we're going to the first step out of Europe, so it's a national disaster. Their result and goal is one: to put out of public debate any policy that puts a brake on the plunder of the majority, that ends obscenity, that prevents the plunder of the state and private individuals.
