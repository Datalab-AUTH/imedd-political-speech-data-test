We don't chew, we tell the people what we believe, we believe what we say.Both before and after the elections, that's why we will blackmail you all.In conclusion, let me come to the European profile of MERA25.We started in Berlin in February 2016 as a pan-European movement.We built a movement in which we are all members without having a Greek part, a German part, a French part, an Italian part and even a British part.We are all members of diem25.Those of us who are running in the elections of MERA25, those of us who are members of MERA25, are an integral part of the only pan-European European, internationalist patriotic movement.No one will teach us a lesson about what a European profile means. They say to us: but you are going against Europe. There have always been two Europes as fellow travellers. There was the Europe of Metternich and the Europe of Lord Byron and the Philhellenes.What is Europe? Metternich? No!
