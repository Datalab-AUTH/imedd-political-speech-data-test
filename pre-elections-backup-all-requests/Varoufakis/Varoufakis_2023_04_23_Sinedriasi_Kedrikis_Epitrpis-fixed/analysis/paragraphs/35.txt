If it wasn't safe and collapsed, if Lehman Brothers in 2008 was unsafe and collapsed, Piraeus, Ethniki, is not safe. They need preparation to become safe, they need tools that do not exist in the Greek state. What the Swiss state did. A combination of a state with deep pockets and a central bank with a printer that prints Swiss francs. And they printed tens of billions to calm down the Swiss banking system, which the Greek government wants to do, but it can't. Firstly, it can't borrow billions, it's already bankrupt and secondly it has no printing presses to make euros.
