The day when he will say a decisive no to the regime of inaccuracy, scandals, interceptions and corruption. In the Mitsotakis regime. And the big and decisive yes to SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance and the progressive government. And I am sure that nothing will be the same in this country on the night of May 21. Greece will leave behind four difficult, four hard years. She will leave behind her insecurity, worry, anxiety and take a first but decisive step towards hope and certainty.
