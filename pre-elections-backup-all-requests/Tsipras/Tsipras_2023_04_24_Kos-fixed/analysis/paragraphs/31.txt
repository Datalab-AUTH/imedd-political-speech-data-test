The clueless Prime Minister.But I have one thing to say to you: He knew, he didn't know, he will learn once and for all on May 21. Because that's where the games end. That's where the "I didn't know" ends. Because those who will go to the polls know how to judge and compare.I want to tell you something: We are not only going strong to get rid of the right-wing, but to get rid of the worst right-wing government that has ever ruled the country. It's not just right-wing.
