We didn't put that money in our pockets, in our accounts, we didn't funnel it to some offshore. We don't have offshore companies, others have offshore companies. We have a clean political record.We have made mistakes, but we served a good policy. We made mistakes and we learned from them. But we also left the Public Treasury full, and the debt regulated, and Greece out of the memoranda and in the markets with twelve quarters of growth.And they came and found it ready. They found the money in the funds, they got the debt settled, they got the economy on track. And instead of having the obligation, as we do, to raise 40 billion. they could afford to spend 60.And I want you to ask yourself? If instead of having the obligation to raise 40, we had the discretion to spend 60, where would the country be now? What would be the result? What would be the balance sheet?
