Their friend Schäuble is no longer there to shout "stop Schäuble" every time the democratic party, SYRIZA, tries to lift up society and the economy.But let's look at the measures that we are proposing one by one and see: are they realistic?Is it a realistic goal to increase the basic wage to 880 euros and to introduce an annual indexation so that every year, if inflation goes up, the wage goes up?We say yes, it is realistic. Because this will not only support thousands of households, but it will stimulate demand, it will revive the market, it will create jobs.Is it a realistic goal to increase, after 14 years of not seeing a 10% increase for civil servants, when inflation has risen by more than 10% in recent years? We say, yes, it is, it's realistic. Because the economy can take it. The 10 billion that was shared between them through direct awards would have been enough for decent salaries in the public sector for many years, not just for one year. But decent wages in the public sector mean higher productivity, better relations with the citizen, and of course a boost to demand and the market.Is lowering prices a realistic goal? Yes, it's realistic.
