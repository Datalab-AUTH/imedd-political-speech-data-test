It is a public electricity company. It will therefore come back to the state with its main concern being the support of the consumer and production.It is a realistic goal, the debt regulation that we announced and described in detail a few days ago with the co-signature of the woman politician who linked her name with the protection of the first home, the middle class and the weak in Greece during the difficult years of the memoranda, Lucas Katseli. Is it realistic? We say yes, it is realistic. With the protection of the first home, professional housing and agricultural land, with transparency, taxation and control over the action and transactions of funds.With 120 instalments and the cancellation of part of the nominal value of the debt, as we did for the debts to the Insurance Funds of freelancers in 2018, we will give breath, but we will also give the economy the opportunity to function. Because as long as these debts accumulate, no one and nothing will move forward. No one will pay back.But is it realistic to have an NHS that is strong and accessible to all? We say, yes, it is. It is difficult, but it can be done. Because there is nothing more realistic and necessary in a modern democratic society than the protection of people's health and life. No cost compares to the cost of a life lost in vain.This is our plan and this is our guarantee.
