Because that's where their programme for the next four years leads. Widening inequalities and squeezing the middle downwards. To put it simply, there is no middle class in their plan. There is no place for the middle class and small and medium-sized entrepreneurship in the resources of the Recovery Fund, which will go to a few conglomerates, as they have been talked about and agreed.There is no place for the middle class when the cartels have to make excess profits from food, fuel, services.

There is no room for the grassroots.
