I can add the word "insecurity", because that is what the average citizen is experiencing today: Insecurity.But I would also like to say "enough is enough", with those who believe that this society, this state, belongs to them. So let's say that it doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the Greek people, so that's it for family rule! We are a normal European country where the people decide!But I said before that Mr. Mitsotakis is very afraid and he shows it. He's so afraid that he doesn't dare to come to a televised debate opposite me, face to face. On the one hand he says that the dilemma of the elections is Mitsotakis or Tsipras, but on the other hand he refuses to come and compare us, to develop our arguments in front of the Greek people.
