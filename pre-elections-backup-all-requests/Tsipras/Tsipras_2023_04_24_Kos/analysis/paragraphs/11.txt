Autocratic governments have arrogantly led society to the brink of despair.So instead of the political system being trained in dialogue and cooperation, in respect for the will of the people, our people should have been trained in the distortion of their will. Well, it's time for a big change. And this great change has to do with the model, with the way of governance.It is time to say "no more" to this distortion of the will of the Greek people. In this election there will be no tricks, no bonuses to multiply votes. There will be no votes and no two-tier citizens.On May 21, what you vote for at the ballot box will be voted for in Parliament. That is why the mandate that SYRIZA will receive as the first party in the May 21 elections will be a clear mandate, an authentic and crystal clear mandate. It will be a mandate to form a strong, progressive government, because strong is the genuine desire of an entire people, not the distortion of it through filters. Only this democratic desire, the popular majority, can and will provide certainty and stable, long-term government.
