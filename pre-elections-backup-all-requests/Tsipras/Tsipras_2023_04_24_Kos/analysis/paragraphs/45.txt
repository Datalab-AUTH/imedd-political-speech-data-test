We did not create this national debt. We left in '19 a debt adjusted and 356 billion in public debt. It has now gone to 400 billion, four years of Mitsotakis' administration.We were in the most difficult times for the Greek economy and the country in the previous administration. And we had an obligation to sacrifice to get the country out of the swamp that others had thrown it into, to settle the debt that others had accumulated and to collect 37 billion in the Public Treasury. That's how much we left. The others left them empty.
