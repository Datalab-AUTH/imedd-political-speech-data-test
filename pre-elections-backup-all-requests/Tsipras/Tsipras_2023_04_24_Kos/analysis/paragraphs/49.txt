The time is approaching when we will all be judged by this people. And it is worth asking, on the way to the polls, friends, every undecided, every citizen, whatever they voted in the last election, to ask themselves: If we have succeeded in these difficult circumstances, is it not realistic to succeed now that the country is out of the memoranda, that there are no constraints, that for the first time we have the freedom to follow our own programme, our own policy?So we can. The diptych of our realism is: We know - we can. So, when people tell us that Syriza wants a second chance, we answer them: We want the first chance to govern on the basis of our own plan, on the basis of our own programme, on the basis of our own strategy. And this will be an opportunity not only for SYRIZA, but also for Greece, for Greek society.Citizens of Kos, citizens of the Dodecanese, I have tried in two words, in short words - not two, but enough - but as short as I could, to describe to you our road map to the elections. The path we want to take together to return justice to the land. And to finally put the country on a path of optimism and hope.But there is an important precondition for all this, a first important step that will change the facts and the acquired speed of a policy that leaves behind a disastrous landscape. And this step - and I say this neither as a figure of speech, nor to vote, nor to exclude the choice of citizens to a looser vote - I say it because this is the reality, I say it because the elections of proportional representation are not the elections of loose voting. They make governments.
