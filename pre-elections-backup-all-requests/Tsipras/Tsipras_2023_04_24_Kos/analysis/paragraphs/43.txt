Can you do it, when you are faced with the big interests, with corruption and this regime of corruption?I answer, we answer, without any reservation: yes, we can. But with one condition: That everything we say and aim for, everything we envision, will be embraced by the majority of our people. And the majority of our people will believe it. We can make all this happen if you can believe in it and fight to make it happen together. You have known us for so many years.You know that we are different from the others. Sometimes we have made mistakes, no doubt about it, but you know we are different. We are not all the same. We are not scions, we are not professionals in power, we do not belong to dynasties that have ruled the country for decades.You have met us, we have met in battle.
