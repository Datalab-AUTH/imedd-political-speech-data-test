On May 21, we will have correlations that can bring about a government without having to go to second or third political elections of instability, uncertainty and adventure for the country. So the precondition is that on the evening of May 21, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance will be first, clearly first in the ballot box, in the popular verdict.And I will tell you as simply as I can: If this regime that has plagued us for four years must be defeated, the vote that will make it defeated, the vote that will make New Democracy lose, is the vote that will make Syriza win. There is no other version.The vote that hurts the establishment more than any other vote, then, is the Syriza vote. Because there is no change, both mathematically and especially politically, without a SYRIZA victory. There is no breath without a SYRIZA victory.Only a SYRIZA victory means a mandate for change and a progressive government on the next day of the elections.Only a SYRIZA victory puts the forces that dynastise Greece on the sidelines and brings society to the forefront.Only a SYRIZA victory gives a progressive government on May 22, without adventures.Only a SYRIZA victory imposes a progressive government of cooperation with the will of the people, for the first time in the country.And don't listen to the fear propaganda of the fearful, they are fearful and they want to turn their own fear into the fear of society. Don't listen to them.Losers never form a government. Governments are always and everywhere formed by the winners. And we will be victorious on May 21! And we will form a government of progressive cooperation!The progressive government will be the product of the victory of SYRIZA, but also of the victory of the Greek people. It will be a product of your victory.So I urge you, from today until the polls, in the next 30 days, not to waste time. To meet house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, to talk to people.
