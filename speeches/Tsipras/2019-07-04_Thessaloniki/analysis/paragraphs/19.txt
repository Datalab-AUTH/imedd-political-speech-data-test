 We are the ones who introduced this year, as a permanent Easter gift as the 13th pension for pensioners.       Finally, the citizens of Thessaloniki are giving tax breaks to the middle class. But they are the ones who led to three hundred thousand locks in the market. It is they who have thrown wage earners and pensioners into poverty and insecurity, and imposed all kinds of taxes on professionals. It is they who humiliated the middle class, handed it over to the lenders with the assurance, remember then, that the middle class 'has fat' and deprived it of even the most basic things. And it is we who, having just taken the noose from our throats, the noose of the memorandum, have introduced the first significant tax relief measures for the middle class in many years. It is we who have placed it, along with labour, at the heart of our concept and plan for growth.
