 So let them hear it well.  The world of labour and the generations of democracy and progress, all generations, will not allow this restoration that is now being attempted. They are not going to allow the return of the great majority of our people to insecurity and the labour jungle.

We must not forget them.         Because, you know, one's work shows what one's words hide.
