 The great battle for the great electoral upset next Sunday. And I also want to appeal to all democrats, to patriots, to progressive citizens, to leftists and leftists of all shades and all generations. Those of us who have walked together, who have parted company at some point, but who are back on the streets of struggle, on the streets of assertion, on the streets of struggle. Because for us, listen, for us, it is not only crucial to hold up the banners of struggle and resistance, but it is also crucial not to escape from the fight to protect the interests of the social majority.
