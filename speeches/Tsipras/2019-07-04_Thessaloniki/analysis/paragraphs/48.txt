 The first chance for the people, the Greek people, to see how a government of the Left, a progressive government, can govern without having its hands tied behind its back by the lenders. We say to them. We are not blaming you because you have high expectations. We have no problem, we just think that people should have expectations, high expectations, especially from us, from the left. But we say to them that the battle we have to fight now is a battle that concerns all of us.      Now the dilemma is not to express a message or not to express a message, to be reflected or not to be reflected in the ballot box. But the stakes are whether the country will be able to move forward, the working people, the great social majority will continue to see relief and support, or whether we will return to the dark days of plunder. And I also want to address all those who have had it drunk into their heads that Syriza has made a class choice, to support the weak and not the middle class.
