 This danger is here. Because no matter how much Mr Mitsotakis has been hiding in recent days and avoiding dialogue, avoiding the programmatic debate, even with half words, the truth has already been revealed. Even with half words, which are then refuted and then spoken again. Mr Mitsotakis, in this election period, without saying anything in particular, has said everything.          What does he want to do if elected. I wonder if he wants to cut taxes.
