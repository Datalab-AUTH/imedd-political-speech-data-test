 To the generation of the later Polytechnic, and to the generation of the Change of the 1980s.  I would like to address this people, who, whatever the current leadership of Kinal says to them, they really believe this slogan. They really do not forget what the right means. And I want to ask them frankly: Really, what can you have to do with KINAL. Its President has said that she will again work with the Southwest. Its president said that she will give a tolerance vote to Mitsotakis. So if you all vote for KINAL today, you are giving a mandate to the right to govern.
