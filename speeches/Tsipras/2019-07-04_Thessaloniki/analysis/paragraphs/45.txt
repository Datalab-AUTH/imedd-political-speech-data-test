 And I call upon you all to move forward together. You too, to put a useful stone and a decisive step towards the great overthrow. Whereas a victory for the Southwest with one vote will mean restoration. It will mean the restoration of the most extreme version of the right. And it is a shame that this will happen with your tolerance or your support.       So we call on all progressives, all democratic citizens to join us in this great battle that we are fighting.
