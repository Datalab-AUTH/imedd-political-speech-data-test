 Not for Syriza, but for Greece. Not for the party, but for our lives. The young people, the pensioners, the small and medium-sized businesses, the intellectuals, all those who look forward to a better tomorrow need it. At the bottom of the IMF, the memoranda and the restoration of the old political establishment that bankrupted us. Which bankrupted us and which now demands what. It's asking us to take back the keys to the country. And first and foremost to take back the keys to the treasury. Those who bankrupted and plundered the fund, those who handed it over empty, are now asking to snatch the labours and sacrifices of the Greek people. They are asking to take the more than 35 billion from the sacrifices of our people and give it to the banks and the bankers. In other words, to those who led us into the crisis.  And I ask you, will the Greek people leave their efforts and sacrifices to those who led them into bankruptcy.
