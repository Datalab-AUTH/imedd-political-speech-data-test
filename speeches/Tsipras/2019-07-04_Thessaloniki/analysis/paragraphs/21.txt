 If we allow those who bankrupted the country to come back, to take over the management, the government of the country.      Citizens of Thessaloniki, the gap between the fine words and bad deeds of the New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis is unfortunately not limited to economic issues. You know. You have often experienced it in a very brutal way here in your city. Here in Thessaloniki, in the capital of our Macedonia, but also in other cities in Macedonia, an incredible campaign of consciousness alteration has unfortunately unfolded over the last year. A miserable campaign of ethnic hatred and unspeakable hypocrisy. A campaign to exploit the patriotic feelings of our people. An attempt to poison and divide the Greek people. Because, you know, there is nothing to hide under the sun, even if they have been trying to hide all this under the sun of Vergina for so many years.
