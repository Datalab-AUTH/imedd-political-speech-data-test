 Let no one say they don't know. With all this on the table, citizens of Thessaloniki, there are no more illusions about the plan that our political opponents have to return us to the dark days of the memorandum policies.       And since you are shouting this slogan of the 1980s, which was heard at the rallies of Andreas Papandreou's PASOK, allow me to address today the voters of today's PASOK. To all those who still believe in the ideas of Andreas Papandreou's PASOK, not in the current leadership of KINAL. To the people of a generation older than mine, the generation of the great struggles. To the generation of 114, the generation that lived through the apostasy.
