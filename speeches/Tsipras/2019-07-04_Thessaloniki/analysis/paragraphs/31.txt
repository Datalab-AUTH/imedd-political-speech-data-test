 Why. Because we understood that this would be bad for the negotiation. Because we understood that it would harm the interests of the country, no matter how much it would benefit the government's interests in the internal debate. We have not spoken, Mr Mitsotakis, for so long, because we love Greece, with dedication, seriousness, selflessness, with sacrifice, if necessary.      The party of democracy and progress, the Left of resistance and struggle, has proved this many times in the course of history. We have always put patriotic interests above party interests. From the Venizelos years, from the epic of the 1940s and the years of the EAM to the present day, the Left, the Democratic Party, has put Greece first. So we too, true to the traditions we represent, put the interests of Greece first. And we are proud that through our efforts we have made our country stronger, stronger in the Balkans, in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Europe.
