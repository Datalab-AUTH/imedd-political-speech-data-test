 Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have an important road ahead of us. Please know that what I am asking you and what I am asking you and what I am expressing my certainty that we can achieve is not the most impossible thing we have ever achieved. And we have achieved all these things.  So now I ask you to achieve the last impossible thing that will be possible, with your support, with your fight, with your vote. And I want you to keep in mind that the most beautiful struggles, and the most beautiful days for all of us, are ahead of us. We have not yet experienced the most beautiful days. It's just that what we've managed to do is to wash away the dirty laundry of the old political system, is to take the noose off our necks. The most beautiful days for our people are ahead of us, and we will live them together, we will create them together, we will claim them together.
