 The wage earners, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the young, the pensioners. They do not forgive us because, in the most difficult circumstances, we resisted cruelty by putting people, solidarity, universal human values and humanity above all else. Whether it was millions of our compatriots, or thousands of refugees facing the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. These things are not forgiven. They do not forgive us because we have spoiled their plans to turn the memoranda into a regime in which the few prosper on the backs of the many. And finally, they do not forgive us for one more thing.        These things are not forgiven. They don't forgive us for that.
