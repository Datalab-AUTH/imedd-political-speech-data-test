 House by house, village by village, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, square by square, I ask you in these three days to believe it, to believe it and to convince one more of each of us. And the great upheaval will come. You can be sure of it. We will win. You can be sure of it.  It is worth it that this new generation is not another generation that will be told at some point that you will live worse than the previous ones.
