 Public or private.  Really, when we fought the battle to prop up a broken welfare state, by hiring in special education, in Help at Home, who were we doing it for. Only for the weak. When we managed to get public schools that opened in September but had teachers and books in December back to normal, who did we do that for. Only for the weak.
