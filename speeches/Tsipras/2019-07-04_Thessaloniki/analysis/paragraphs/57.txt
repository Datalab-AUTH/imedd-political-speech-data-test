 Not a minute wasted in these last hours. To leave no one alone on the road to the ballot box. To talk to the people, to convince the people, to fill the people with optimism and to fill the empty ballot box on Sunday morning with our own dreams, our own plans, our own will of optimism. Let us fill it with SYRIZA's ballot papers for the great electoral upheaval.
