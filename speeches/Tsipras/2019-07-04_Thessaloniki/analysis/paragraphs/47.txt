 Not to run away, to fight the battle, even if you lose, even if you have defeats, even if you have wounds, to stand up and fight.      But I am addressing these people, the citizens of the Left of all generations and of all shades, who I know contributed decisively to the great miracle of 2015 and of January and September and July. And I address to all of us, despite our differences, an invitation to unity, struggle and fight for the great political upheaval.  Because now, citizens of Thessaloniki, some people tell us, you want a second chance. We answer them. It is the first chance to govern with our own programme, without orders, without pressure, without blackmail.
