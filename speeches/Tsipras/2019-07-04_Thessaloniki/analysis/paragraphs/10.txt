  Do you know something citizens of Thessaloniki. They do not forgive us. And why don't they forgive us. They don't forgive us because we succeeded where they failed with three successive governments. They do not forgive us because we finally got the country out of the memoranda. They do not forgive us because we did this while taking care of the weakest.
