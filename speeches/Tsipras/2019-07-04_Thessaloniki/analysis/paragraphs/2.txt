 From Crete, the Dodecanese, Florina, Kavala, Tripoli, Patras, I bring you one message. Subversion is not just a need for the great social majority. It has already begun.  I see it in people's eyes, in people's passion, in people's stubbornness, in the determination with which we fight the difficult battle. I see it today, here in Thessaloniki, in your faces.
