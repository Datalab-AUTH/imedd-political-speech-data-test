They are the ones who abolished collective bargaining, depriving workers of the basic right to negotiate and fight, that is, for the conditions and pay of their work. And it is we who, as soon as we came out of the memoranda, restored collective bargaining, raised the minimum wage by 11% and abolished the shameful sub-minimum wage for young people. And it is they, we, who committed to a 15% increase in the minimum wage over the next two years to bring wages back to pre-crisis levels.      They also provide decent pensions.
