 Well, then, let them not forgive us. To us their slanders are praise. It is praise for the toxic attacks of big media with blood and money ties to them. For us, attacks and hospitality are praise, like the day before yesterday when I decided to fight the battle of SKY, because Mr Mitsotakis himself never came to confront me and I decided to go to his court. It is praise for us that this reception. It is praise for us that these attacks have taken place.
