Is it a realistic goal to reduce prices? Yes, it is realistic. By reducing VAT on food and essentials. In Spain, in other countries they have even introduced zero VAT on consumer goods and foodstuffs. Also by reducing the VAT on fuel to the lowest possible level provided for by the European Union and by abolishing the VAT on agricultural oil. The public purse can bear this cost, all the more so as the price reduction will result in an increase in purchasing power and government revenue, while the popular strata and the middle class will be a huge boost.
