So the time has come for all these voices from all over the country to come together and say two words: That's it! No more injustice, no more obscenity, no more indecency, no more dignity! And I can say more next to injustice, obscenity, indecency, injustice, injustice. I can also add the word 'insecurity', because that is what the average citizen is experiencing today: Insecurity. But I would also like to say 'enough' to those who believe that this society, this state, belongs to them. So let's say that it doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the Greek people, so that's it for family rule! We are a normal European country where the people decide!
