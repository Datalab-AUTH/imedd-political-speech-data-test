You know better than anyone that we have an unpredictable neighbour. It's right next door to you. History has ordered you to the front lines. And you recognise even more than anyone else the need for a serious, decisive and nationally responsible foreign policy. Now tell me what a resident of the Dodecanese can think when he sees the entries all over the European press about the so-called "Turkish-Georgia"? Turkaegean, that's what they called it. What can he think of the government of the super-patriots who let this happen? Did they get caught sleeping again? Did they not know? Didn't the clueless PM know again? It's not that they were caught napping. It's that they presented themselves to us as "excellent" but forgot to put an "X". "Useless", not "excellent"!
