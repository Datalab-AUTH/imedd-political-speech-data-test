Nektarios, whom we lost so unjustly, had an important vision. An important vision that we put into practice, but today the government of the New Democracy is discrediting it. The transport equivalent for the islands and our islanders, who we do not want to be second-class citizens. This measure, a breath of fresh air for the island country, has been left exposed with delays in payments and an uncertain future by the current government. Delays in payments to beneficiaries starting from 8 months and very often exceeding a year. In practice, these delays mine the smooth operation of the transport equivalence scheme, with the unstated political aim of devaluing it, devaluing a measure that has been embraced by islanders from the very first moment, precisely because it responds to their real needs. These delays do not even allow for a proper evaluation of this innovative, radical reform. In any case, to give you a measure of comparison, the 156 million per year that SYRIZA had budgeted for its implementation in 2019 alone is almost the same as the total amount that the New Democracy government claims to have spent over four years. What we budgeted for the first year, they will have spent for four full years. To give you a measure of comparison, how they are trying to discredit this measure. So we, in the vision and memory of Nektarios, will put it back into practice. And we will put it into practice.
