Political change, then, but above all - I say to you, our slogan, justice everywhere - is not an idea born in party offices. It is a need of our society. It requires the certainty of a plan and the forces that are capable of putting it into practice. So first, we say we know, we have a clear plan. Anyone who votes for Syriza is voting for four things. I say them briefly so that we can commit them to memory and pass them on to the citizens we will meet in the next few days:
Wage increases.
A reduction in prices.
Debt settlement.
A fair and efficient state.
