Well, it's time for a big change. And this big change has to do with the model, with the way of governance. The time has come to say "no more" to this distortion of the will of the Greek people. In these elections there will be no tricks, no bonuses to multiply votes. There will be no votes and no two-tier citizens. On 21 May, what you vote for at the ballot box will be voted for in Parliament. That is why the mandate that SYRIZA will receive as the first party in the May 21 elections will be a clear mandate, it will be an authentic and crystal clear mandate. It will be a mandate to form a strong, progressive government. Because strong is the authentic desire of an entire people, not the distortion of it through filters. Only this democratic desire, the popular majority, can and will provide certainty and stable, long-lasting government. This popular majority will seal the great change and become the embryo of justice in our land. And justice cannot be so much either. For where there is no justice, injustice reigns, the arrogance of power, the impunity of the oligarchy. Justice must be a universal principle. Otherwise it does not exist. Justice must be everywhere. In the economy, in society, in the state. Justice is the foundation stone of the Greece we want to build. Because the Greece we have lived these four years does not deserve anyone who lives, works, studies, dreams with honesty and dignity in this country.
