Hello! Thank you very much for your presence and for your welcome here in beautiful Kos, in democratic Kos, in the democratic Dodecanese. It is a great pleasure to be here tonight among you. And today I believe that all of us are present and present here today in a great invitation, a democratic invitation. A democratic call for the change that will come with the vote of the Greek people on 21 May. I am very happy but also moved to be here in Kos, in the Dodecanese. I know and you know that this democratic invitation today, this very nice gathering, is missing a piece of our heart, a man, a great comrade who loved his country, who served his principles and ideas with vigour and dedication for his entire life: Nektarios Santorinios, whom we lost recently, and who, as Minister of Island Policy, did very important things for the Dodecanese and all the islands. So the struggle that we will be fighting for the Dodecanese and for the whole country will also be his struggle. And I would like to begin my speech by announcing that in his memory and in his honour, I will be a candidate in the Dodecanese, trying to fill this very large gap, but also trying to honour a place that has always been a pioneer in the democratic struggles of our people.
