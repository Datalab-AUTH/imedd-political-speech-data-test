But I have one thing to say to you: He didn't know, he'll find out once and for all on May 21. Because that's where the games end. That's where the 'I didn't know' ends. Because those who go to the polls know how to judge and compare. I want to tell you something: We're not just going strong to get rid of the right wing, but to get rid of the worst right wing government that has ever ruled this country. It's not just right-wing. It is a limited liability company, as the late Gennimata said. She first said it. "Maximou Inc." she said. "Mitsotakis Inc." I will say. It's under the family name, the joint stock company. So this government shames even the right-wingers, our fellow conservatives. So that's why I want the right to go, certainly firmly, but above all I want this government of great inequalities to go. This government of inexactitude, this government of eavesdropping, this government that has shrunk the rule of law. This government that has taken us far away from European normality.
