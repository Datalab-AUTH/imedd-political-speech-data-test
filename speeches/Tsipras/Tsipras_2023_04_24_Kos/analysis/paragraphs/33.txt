His panic is great. But you know what? This is the classic fake news strategy used in Europe and the world by those who call the alt-right the far right - Trump, Trumpism has taught us this. They present the biggest lie as truth. But the Greek people do not eat grass. The time is approaching when we will all be judged by this people. And it is worthwhile on the way to the polls, friends, every undecided, every citizen, whatever they voted in the last election, to ask themselves: If we have succeeded in these difficult circumstances, is it not realistic to succeed now that the country is out of the memoranda, that there are no constraints, that for the first time we have the freedom to follow our own programme, our own policy? So we can. The diptych of our realism is: We know - we can. So when people tell us that Syriza wants a second chance, we answer them: We want the first chance to govern on the basis of our own plan, on the basis of our own programme, on the basis of our own strategy. And this will be an opportunity not only for SYRIZA, but also for Greece, for Greek society.
