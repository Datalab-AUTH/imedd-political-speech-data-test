And I'll tell you as simply as I can: If this regime that has plagued us for four years must be defeated, the vote that will make it defeated, the vote that will make New Democracy lose, is the vote that will make Syriza win. There is no other version. The vote that hurts the establishment more than any other vote, then, is the SYRIZA vote. Because there is no change, both mathematically and especially politically, without a Syriza victory. There is no breathing space without a SYRIZA victory. Only a SYRIZA victory means a mandate for change and a progressive government on the next election day. Only SYRIZA's victory puts the forces that dynastise Greece on the sidelines and brings society to the forefront. Only SYRIZA's victory gives a progressive government on May 22, without adventures. Only SYRIZA's victory imposes a progressive government of cooperation with the will of the people, for the first time in the country. And don't listen to the fear propaganda of the fearful, they are fearful and want to turn their own fear into the fear of society. Don't listen to them. Losers never form a government. Governments are always and everywhere formed by the winners. And we will be winners on May 21! And we will form a government of progressive cooperation!
