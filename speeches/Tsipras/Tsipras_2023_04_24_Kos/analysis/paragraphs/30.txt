This is our plan and this is our guarantee. The road map we will follow, the map of political change. And what we say, what we propose, what we plan, is the outgrowth of our experience and our relationship with society. So can these things be done? Many are asking themselves. Can you do them, when you are confronted with big interests, with corruption and this regime of corruption? I answer, we answer, without any reservation: yes, we can. Yes, we can: That everything we say and aim for, everything we envision, is embraced by the majority of our people. And the majority of our people will believe in them. We can make all this happen if you can believe it and fight to make it happen together. After all, you have known us well for so many years. You know that we are different from the others. Sometimes we have made mistakes, no doubt about it, but you know that we are different. We are not all the same. We are not scions, we are not professionals in power, we do not belong to dynasties that have been ruling the country for decades. You know us, we met in battle. In the battle for a better society, a more just society. To get Greece out of the quagmire of bankruptcy. When with the country bankrupt, broken, we were forced to clean up the mess left by those who came before us. That's where you met us, that's where we met.
