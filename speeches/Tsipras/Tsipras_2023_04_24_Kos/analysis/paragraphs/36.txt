The progressive government will be the product of the victory of SYRIZA, but also of the victory of the Greek people. It will be the product of your victory. That is why I urge you, from today until the polls, in the next 30 days, not to lose any time. Let us meet at home, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, to talk to the people. We don't have the media to do propaganda for us. But we do have the arguments. We have our clear and honest political speech; we have our proposals. We have our programme! These we want to be our weapons in this crucial election. I therefore call on you to become the agents of the great change that the country needs. Be the change we expect to see on May 21. And to give again, with pride, the first place to SYRIZA and the Democratic Party in the Dodecanese! In this democratic land that has a great tradition of struggles for democracy. I would like to thank you warmly for your very warm presence here in Kos today, for a great victory rally here in Kos, for a great victory rally. And to carry the message from Kos to Rhodes, to Karpathos, to Kalymnos, to Tilos, to all the islands, to all the Dodecanese. Let's go together for the great victory. And I will be with you in this struggle. Both as a candidate and tomorrow from any position, and especially from the position of Prime Minister, to support the Dodecanese. To support our islands, to support our islanders. Because 'justice everywhere' means priority for our islands.
