When a handful of companies are making super profits, record profits for twenty years, over 1 billion each, at the same time as household debt has increased over these four years by 40 billion euros, you realise that this is not an equation that works. When there is no first home protection and for a few thousand euros the banks first, the funds now, take houses and businesses, in a country where the ruling party, which passes these laws to remove first home protection, is in debt to the banks to the tune of over 400 million euros, but nobody says anything about it. Things cannot go on like this. Where 4 200 000 Greek citizens, that is half of Greece, have non-performing loan debts to banks, to funds, debts to the tax office, to the EFKA. And 1,000,000 bank accounts have been seized in recent years.
