I was also very annoyed by what is happening with the candidates for parliamentarians, especially in Xanthi and Rodopi. Seeing their advertising leaflets in Turkish. It is as unthinkable as seeing a party declaring themselves Turkish. And to see New Democracy and PASOK and SYRIZA competing to see who will put on their ballot the most Turks who can get into the consulate more easily. This is abhorrent to me. I am ashamed as a Greek for their choice to look at votes and not at Thrace.It is no coincidence that Erdogan's recent statements that we do not forget the elections in Thrace are not understood by the Athenians.Those who have Athenian-centric logic and not regional logic do not understand it. It is unthinkable that Mr Mitsotakis should have a press that interferes. Listen to a smaller party, which has put people back in. Through the Consulate. And who were disengaged from that party's ticket and left, resigned and New Democracy said so. It is tragic what is happening to have the consulate in charge of our Thrace. We, because we honour Thrace, have put up a candidate who is a Greek Pomak, a Greek Pomak, a patriot who is being persecuted for what is both the Greek state and the Turkish consulate. And we are proud of our choice, we chose him because he is a pomakos, he is a Greek ancient wild Greek, but the wild beasts of the Athenocentric establishment put people of the Consulate and not such lads who fight for Greece. This is our conception of the national interest and this is our view of the nation and the homeland.
