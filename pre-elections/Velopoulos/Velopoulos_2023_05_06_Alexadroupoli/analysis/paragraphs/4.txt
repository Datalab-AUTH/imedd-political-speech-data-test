So let me start by going a little bit into the economy. Where I see. With sadness. That the new democracy, SYRIZA, especially these two but also PASOK, are possessed by the syndrome of Abderism. Abdirism. In ancient times it was an attitude of the rich, but especially of the leaders of Avdira, where they built huge infrastructure in the city, they spent huge amounts of money to have nice fountains and nice baths, but they did not take care of how to bring the water.So does PASOK and New Democracy and SYRIZA promise money, but they do not tell us where they will find it. Their obduracy, their frivolity, their stupidity, but above all their theory is based on the short memory of the Greeks. We will say it once again, something that they all avoid to say, the European Central Bank said that in the event of a wage increase, the interest rates will increase, the interest rates of all borrowing, both of the countries and of the people.
