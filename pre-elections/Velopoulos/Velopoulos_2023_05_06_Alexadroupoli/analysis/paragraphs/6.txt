And I'll let them insult each other as well. I have to answer the Greek Prime Minister because yesterday in Amalia and in Pyrgos he said something.I know that while he was speaking we are housewives and we are housewives, and mentioning his party, we should remind him that his party owes 430 million euros in loans, in sea loans, in battery loans, because they are battery loans, just like PASOK, so I should remind him that as a natural person he has borrowed and has not repaid them. So the landlord or the householder is neither a bachelor, nor do they leave loans unpaid, and what is worse, when they are prime ministers, they enable borrowers to take the same haircut that they gave to oligarchs, canal owners, shipowners and their friends to the tune of around EUR 6 billion.
