And it is right and appropriate to say it once again after these elections on May 21, one thing is for sure that they will co-govern Tsipras' visit to Solts is no coincidence that Blinken's visit to Athens is also no coincidence that the new Republic gave the Kochi rahmi 200 million euros to make electric cars in Turkey and that these cars are circulating in Greece from the Recovery Fund is no coincidence. All this shows that we are going into coexistence in the Aegean. And remember this because all 3 of them voted for certain unpopular and anti-national laws. Example, energy exchange. SYRIZA did the stock exchange and the new democracy implemented it, but the story started before with PASOK and new democracy in the funds was started by PASOK in 2003. I extend SYRIZA of 16, and 19 and 18 and implement new democracy to steal the houses of the Greeks. Yesterday I was ashamed to see an inexperienced man in Halkidiki. Police entering his house, breaking down his door and taking his house. What foreign national of a European Union Skopjan, please Skopjan, takes in Macedonia the house of a Greek Macedonian cripple. This is the shame, the shame of Greece and even illegally takes the house. Because a European citizen can take it at auction. Skopje is not in the European Union. So I say to you, all the bad things the 3 of them did is 3 parties in the package of one with the same policies same concepts and worst of all the same anti-national commitments keep it. Thank you very much
