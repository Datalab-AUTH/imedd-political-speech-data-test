I would like to thank you all for being here today. I must say that whenever I come to the prefecture of Evros, mainly, but also to the whole of Thrace, but also to Evros, because I come from the region by descent or, if you like, by descent. I feel particularly well and I feel particularly well. Because we northern Greeks are a different breed of people. And a different breed of people, not in origin, but in behaviour, especially in mentality and philanthropy. I believe that. I insist on this because we are perhaps in a party that since 1912 has been liberated mainly in Northern Greece, Northern Greece, Macedonia, Northern Greece as a whole is represented in the Greek parliament. Another one in itself I would say. Our view is that the whole province as a whole. It is unjustified by 40,000 rodents and I insist on the one of Athens. There are 40,000 rodents and another 20,000 in all of Greece. Scattered rodents of the parties those we called them grouses in the past, but the unfortunate thing is that in Athens the 40,000 rodents do not get a salary of one and a half two thousand, but they are paid very well these 8 9 10,000 EUROS salaries.
