I say all this because a few days ago they distributed 9 million euros to the national channels. I am not saying that the channels should not get 9 million, but I am saying that the citizen is in greater need. Much greater, and on the other hand, I must say that the regional channels did not get anything, but instead of supporting the region and the regional channels, they supported the water-headed state of Athens again, and the oligarchic channel owners again. And we are opposed to this, as we are to all the phenomena of the current phenomena of the subservience of the country's political personnel to money, to the oligarchs and canal owners, that is to say, to the plutocracy.
