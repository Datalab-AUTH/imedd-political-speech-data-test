So, if we don't produce wealth, as the Greek solution says, if we don't support the farmers, if we don't support the fishermen, the livestock breeders, it is certain mathematically that there will be a great hunger, I say this because we are already facing hunger phenomena in cities mainly but also in villages. Why do Greeks have no money when I learned today that a farmer who paid two and a half thousand euros for water was asked to pay â‚¬9000? I was really shocked, because the peasant farmer and the fisherman who need water for their own, especially the peasant farmer who need water to be able to water and reap any fields in which. Their commodities must be supported immediately by any government, on the understanding that without them we cannot survive, so instead of helping them, they are leading them into poverty. They cannot give the shipowner tax free oil and not have tax free oil. The farmer, the stockman who feed all of us at the same time if you do that you are of course assisting. And the exports and the very important for me wrong choices are reversed what are these milk imports. Imports of like products are their crimes, the ongoing ones. I haven't stopped saying them for 4 years and I keep saying them because I'm from the province. I am a provincial and I say it straight, I am a peasant from a village I come from, I have nothing to do with the Athenian-centric system, I have nothing to do with them and I don't want them to split because our quality is totally different in the province from those who lead place.
