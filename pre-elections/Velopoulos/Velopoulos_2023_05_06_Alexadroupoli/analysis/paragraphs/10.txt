And I'll say something that a Belgian writer says. Paul Carvell I read it in full and I say it to all citizens, politics needs people who don't need politics. It is a very important saying of the man. Political leaders without politics today will be nothing tomorrow if they are not elected. The speaker if not elected has a job and has a job and can do what he did before. They do not know what they will do. So I call on the Greek people to vote for a sensible Greek solution, the only Greek patriotic solution that can provide a solution to our Greece's major problems. Thank you again for being here. If there are any questions, I am willing to answer them if there are not, I think we have closed a chapter on Evros. Shall we continue? Tours where we can.
