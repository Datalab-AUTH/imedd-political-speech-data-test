Here's proof of how panicky the new democracy is that this panicky party plants undercuts where it suits them, they let them through and cut the ones that don't suit them. What this means is that they are in a panic they are interested in power and not the substance of politics. At all costs they want power in the new republic and especially the PM's entourage is not to blame for anything. The New Democrat nor the New Democracy voter for the crimes committed by the New Democracy leadership. Crimes against democracy, crimes against political opponents, crimes against Greece.
