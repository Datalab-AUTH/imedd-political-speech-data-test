I start like this because I understand that the political staff of the country has a problem communicating and arguing on the big issues of the country, especially the economy and national issues. We can see that their rivalry is over the very small issues. Really it's a wonder how you want a story on the shit of this known. Now journalist, his employee I don't know that this gentleman was. Who said that SYRIZA has gone as an advocate in the 17 November trials and SYRIZA has been scratched and they started arguing since yesterday afternoon, yesterday afternoon, about this issue, this issue shows that on the big issues that really concern Greek society they do not disagree on anything and they are only looking for the small ones in the small ones, that is, to disagree to fill their party audience.
