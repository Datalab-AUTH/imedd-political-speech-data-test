It is a really sad picture to see New Democracy and Syriza talking about the 80s or 90s, when we are talking about two thousand and 23 for the next elections on May 21, which are very important for the Greek people, who are starving and have become beggars. I say this because this is how this election period will continue until two months ago they were talking about partnerships, the three of them, and then a month ago they started to leaflet and say that there will be a partnership between the two of them or one or the other and for the last few days they have been insulting each other. This is the election season.Tomboy clowns says the other one, I have in front of me. Aggressive determinations of the latter. Clowns murdering people, terrorists, purges in the public sector. The others, the expression, the. Not to say it in public children who go to private schools. Purges of journalists, judicial bad luck. The prime minister says the opponent, candidate for prime minister, fascists the one and the other. So you see that where they disagree is in their humble instincts they disagree on the small to rally their parties because they have no programs and no arguments. Unfortunately, I say this with bitterness because if this story continues, it will escalate very badly. And we will disorientate the Greek people. I want the Greek to go to the ballot box on May 21 to think rationally. Not to be possessed by the syndrome. And I say Stockholm; you can't vote for what has murdered you economically, socially, morally politically, it's unthinkable. It's tragic.
