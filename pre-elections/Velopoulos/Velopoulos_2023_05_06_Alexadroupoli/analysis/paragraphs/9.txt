We will not change it despite the dirty war we have suffered, despite the hatred that the new Democracy is putting out for the Greek solution, despite its undemocratic and fascist behaviour to cut off commas, sub-committees, formations, parties, it doesn't matter. Because it is the right of the Greek to vote for whomever he wants. What democracy did, not even a junta can do. And I say this bluntly. We are not concerned with the rhetoric of journalists or politicians. Do you want votes from the party? We want votes from the KKE to the most right wing, we don't care what they voted for in the last election? We want all Greeks to go and vote so that we can finally get away from a political staff that is too small and the big problems of the country.
