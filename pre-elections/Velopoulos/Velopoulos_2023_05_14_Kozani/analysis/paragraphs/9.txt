For those who follow the developments, they understand that in the last four years PASOK voted for about 78% of the bills of New Democracy. You do not understand that we are looking for partnerships, since they exist anyway. SYRIZA 50% and more with a drop in the last 3 months, because SYRIZA abstained from the parliamentary process. That's why its percentage dropped. Otherwise it wasn't at 55%. When I listen I agree, Mr Tsipras, to 55% of Mr Mitsotakis' bills. When I agree, Mr Androulakis, to 80% of Mr Mitsotakis' bills. I do not understand why you are arguing. I do not understand why they are arguing, why they are arguing and where they are arguing. They voted to sell off the lignites, to close them down. They voted together for the privatisation of the PPC. They also voted for the selling off of all public wealth, not to forget everything to do with the energy providers. Stock market all 3 together. They voted for fan creation and electronic auctions. Step by step all together, hand in hand. So therefore I can't see where they disagree. What their disagreement is. And I'm addressing the voters of these parties who are comfortable. Many of them and I understand that because unfortunately, the productive model of the country creates armies of partisans. A productive model that bases its operation on 74 percent service delivery means what does that mean, about 45-50 or more percent of Greeks are dependent on the public sector. Whether they are civil servants or pensioners. It simply means that this dependency is returned at the ballot box and the party armies will never change sides because their first concern is the party and then Greece.
