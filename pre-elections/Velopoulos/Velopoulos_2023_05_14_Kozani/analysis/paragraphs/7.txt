But I have this to say to New Democracy and its votes. A friend of Prime Minister Erdogan. Chavusoglu is a friend of Dendias. Rama is a friend of the Prime Minister and Dendias. If you have such friends, why do you need enemies? When you have friends who are enemies of Greece, then either you are not doing your job well or you are a fool. I think it is the former. I do not want to believe that either Mr Dendias or the Prime Minister are fools.
