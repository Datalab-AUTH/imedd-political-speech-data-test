I have been saying it for a very long time and I have been insisting on it and you see, I have not even mentioned mining, which is worth 300 billion euros in our country. This is enormous wealth and no Mitsotakis and no Tsipras and no Androulakis have the right to bury this wealth of the Greek people. With 300 billion from here and another 500 billion euros minimum in gas and oil extraction, the Greek can eat with golden spoons and be rich as gold and if you connect this to pensions, as Norwegians have been doing for years, the pensioner will get 3 and 4000€ and this money will not come from borrowing but from production and the pensioner gets 3 and 4000€ he doesn't put it in his pocket and keeps it and drives it to the market and this money is the 1000 - 1500 of each person that will drive the market. They will also move the café they will become and the restaurant they will move and the clothes shop, but that's exactly where you have to change the production line again and produce yourself so that the money can stay here.
