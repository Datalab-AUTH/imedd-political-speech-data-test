That's the production model that got us here, you know? Kozani could have had free heating, the whole prefecture and the whole of Macedonia and it should have had it because it has the possibility of lignite. It should have been a vast construction site. It should have been. It is not. Kozani should have been a hub for Western Macedonia along with Florina to the north and west. We insist to the Prime Minister that the railway network should at some point be taken seriously in the rest of the country and a parallel axis of our border from Alexandroupoli should lead to Igoumenitsa with a vertical railway network so that we can transport the pre-conditions the cheapest means of transport. Of course, what products to transport. I say all this to show you how the different perception and image we have of the country's economy, of cooperation, warn the Greek people once again that Tsipras, Mitsotakis Androulakis after the day after the elections or the second election will come together in cooperation.
Not because they want to, but because the foreign agent is forcing it on them. The purpose is to go to co-exploitation of mineral wealth, strange as it may seem. If 20 years ago it was said that a government would come out and that it would very easily pass the treacherous Prespa agreement and no one from the political parties would object. Would you tell me what you are saying? It is not so, the parties will react, we saw it.
So the second one will happen after the elections and it will happen because the statements of the top executives of all the parties, PASOK, New Democracy and Syriza, are that this is the direction that anyone who doesn't want to see it has a problem in his vision. Anyone who does not want to see it has a problem in his thinking, his judgment and his memory.
