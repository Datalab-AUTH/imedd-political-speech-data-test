I say this very simply so that the people of Kozani who see our interview will understand. That nothing is accidental in this country, its flattening is by design. Its withering away is a choice. Its demise is their act. All of this must be taken very seriously and because for us the economy is too important for any of them to play a game for laughs and tears. Let me tell them that those who look at the international economic freedom table. Let the political leaders do some research on what economic freedom means. They will see that at the moment we are just above Estonia, just above Romania, which is about to pass us and shortly to pass Bulgaria. We will be last on the economic index table. So they have succeeded in 20 years in making us last in Europe. And I ask the last citizen of the country. Tell me, tell me what this country produces?
If a citizen can be found who produces it, I will discuss it. A country that, I repeat, is based on service delivery, has no future, has only 74% service delivery debts. This service provision includes tourism, which is not a heavy industry, but it is the way we operate. I say all this so that you understand that what the political leaders say. And they do not tell us where they will get the money are from the graphic to the ridiculous.
