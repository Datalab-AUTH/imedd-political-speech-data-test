I want to comment on 2 things about Kozani. Yesterday afternoon, strangely enough, while we had booked a hotel room, the main hotelier cancelled the room. I do not want to believe that this is due to the premonition, fear, panic of the new democracy, because it is used to being a new democracy anyway. Such acts and actions, but I am saddened and I say this effortlessly by a fact that proves that we Macedonians are forgetting, forgetting the behaviour of the water-headed state of Athens, the 40,000 rodents and the rest of their Praetorian troops who have been preying for decades on the whole province and especially in Macedonia, so that we can talk about Macedonia, since we are in Macedonia. And I wonder how Kozanians even today defend this logic and mentality. Of the water-headed state of this monstrosity called Athens of 40,000 rodents. I am not referring to the inhabitants.
