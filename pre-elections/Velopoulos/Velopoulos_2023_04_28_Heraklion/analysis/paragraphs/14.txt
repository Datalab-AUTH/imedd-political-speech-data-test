I just wanted to say and I will say because I am in favour of the primary sector, strongly. I went to the Heraklion farmers' market. We don't go, we don't have breakfasts and gatherings like other people do at their own branch farmers. Clappers, I tell you, I hate them because they've got seconded, they've got appointed. Thousands of people live and work in Greece and they applaud every leader of a party in power. But we went to the farmers' market and I saw that in the market in Crete there were Egyptian potatoes. At the same time in the prefecture of Serres in the warehouses there are huge quantities of potatoes from Serres and from Drama. Uncontrolled imports from Egypt and Turkey are filling the Greek markets with imported products. We have said it a thousand times. the local economy must be supported. the Cretan hotels that have Cretan products in them must not have Egyptian ones. Our popular market has no Greek products inside to move the economy we can't go anywhere like this. Our proposal is of course the specific. in the hotels of Crete, those hotels that put Greek products in, local, Cretan will have lower taxation. Zero. So you win, what? You start producing agricultural products, even honey and fish, which the tourists eat and you create goodwill for next year.
