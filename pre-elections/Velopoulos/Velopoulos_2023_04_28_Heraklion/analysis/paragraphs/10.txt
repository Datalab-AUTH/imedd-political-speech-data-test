Unfortunately, this shows that we are going down dangerous paths of regime choices, and I said before that you cannot ban parties for using a symbol that is Greek, not of another country or a word or two words and then ban them from running for elections. It is a disgrace what is happening. Just as it is shameful for a party to denounce other parties and it comes to the point where party leaders or party officials kill each other for a position. I stop here because things are much more difficult for the elections because listen. A million or so Greek expatriates had the opportunity, because they exist, to vote if the state helped them. Of these, only twenty-five thousand will vote, expatriates, and they will go to vote because they are on some lists. The strange thing is that Argentinean Greeks vote in Houston, USA. So they will be forced to leave Argentina and go to vote thousands of miles away, go to Houston. The North-Epetians can vote in Sofia. The Greeks of Perth vote in Melbourne three and a half thousand kilometres away. This is not a vote for the expatriates, who must vote, they must participate, they must intervene, because the expatriates are very important to Greece. In order to have extroversion, New Democracy did everything possible to create problems for our expatriates. I say this because Cretans also have expatriates all over the world, mainly in America, as far as I know, and unfortunately this state does not help Greek expatriates to vote. Let me put it differently, the government is doing everything possible to prevent them from voting. Perhaps because it is afraid of the love for the Greek national issues, history and culture that expats have for Greece and wants to prevent them from going to the polls.
