But I would like to go a little bit into the economics. I'm going to show you a map, I don't know if the TVs can pick it up. It's the geometric progression of debt and GDP. So if you look here we're talking about 2004 to 2023. It's this chart that shows the increase in debt to about 400 billion euros. So what has the new democracy achieved? To increase the debt by 400 billion euros. To have 50% red loans of the loans that exist in the market and, above all, to put Greeks at risk of losing their homes. It is a wonder that PASOK, New Democracy and SYRIZA have legislated precisely in the interests of the funds and people who act as crows and do not protect the property of the Greeks. I know that Crete does not have such a big problem with borrowers, but the rest of Greece is groaning under the boot of the loans. We have proposed something specific, the cancellation of debts, across-the-board, including the EFKA, the tax office and the tax office and the loans, but no one listens to us. The huge success for the new democracy is that Greece is now the third worst in the European Union in terms of GDP per capita, in terms of our purchasing power, in terms of units of strength. To be third worst in terms of the poverty rate. In other words, Greece is third from the bottom of all the countries of the European Union in terms of poverty.
