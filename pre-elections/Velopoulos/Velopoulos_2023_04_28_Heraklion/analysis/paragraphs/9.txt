Last place for freedom of the press. Here, of course, the new democracy has achieved the impossible. Greece, the country that gave birth to democracy, has no freedom of press and speech. It controls all the media anyway. Especially in the big national media, which go along with government policy and even sometimes provocatively anger the opposing parties, I am referring to all parties, with the presence of the ERC and the absence of pluralism and pluralism, which ERC takes a strange attitude in favour of the new democracy. I understand that Mr Koutroumanos was Mr Mitsotakis's suggestion to the ERC, but he should at least observe ethics.
