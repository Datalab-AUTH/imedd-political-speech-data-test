The other parties are not speaking and that worries me. I am very concerned. And we're getting to a point, Mr. Dendias apologizing for predator yesterday and pointing to Maximou. The predator which was used in Sudan and they have a civil war today. These show something. And here I also blame Mr. Androulakis, who strangely enough, he brought down the issue of eavesdropping too much. He does not mention it himself. Now and then he says it. Maybe because he has a difficulty himself that, I know, because he said something, he was overheard saying something on his phone and he can't talk? I don't know, but that's no way to go into an election. That's not how Greece can go to an election. You can't go to elections with threats, gagging parties, gagging people who want to talk. For example, the Greek solution does not have the same treatment as the other parties, they are constantly silencing us, they are not letting us speak. They shut down my broadcasts and my work, they don't let me work. This means that the new democracy is in a panic. Panic, not because it wants to rule. No. But simply because the Prime Minister has a problem with his own chair. He's interested in the chair. That's why you see that there's this constant aggression from Maximos' side to everyone else who opposes him. And of course, the Greek solution is opposition with arguments and you will never forget that because we were really the only opposition.
