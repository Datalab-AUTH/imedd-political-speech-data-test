I would like to thank you all for being here today. I have to admit that Crete really embraced the Greek solution. I must also say that there are a number of issues that have plagued and plagued our Crete for decades. But overall I would like to say that the offer of the Greek solution to Crete will be the promotion of Crete in our election message. It is a surprise that we are saving for our Cretan friends that will highlight the historical cultural heritage of this region that is the matrix of Greek civilization. The least the state can do is the Greek solution. So you will see our advertising, our TV spot, one of the many we will prepare, will be based on this very fact. It will be a surprise for the Cretans and it will be a surprise for all Greeks of course. A clever TV message and promotion of Crete all over the world. We are starting this way because it has been proven that the Greeks, especially the state, are below par.
