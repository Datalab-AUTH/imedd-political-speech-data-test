I'm left with the Prime Minister's statement, of course, who from Xanthi said something incredible that if Greece were truly a democracy, the Prime Minister should be under arrest today. He said: we are ready to examine our basic dispute, which is none other than the delimitation of the maritime zones in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, always in accordance with international law. But we are always unwilling to tolerate any challenge to our sovereign rights. In other words, we accept discussion of national sovereignty, which is our territorial waters, which are included in the maritime zones, but not any questioning of sovereign rights. This is a blunt admission by the Prime Minister that he himself is challenging Greece's borders. Indeed, if there were a constitutional court, if there were justice, the Prime Minister today is under indictment for what he said. He is opening backdoors. And of course the prime minister himself, and the other parties who are silent. no one is talking. This is very strange and we have to look at it very carefully.
