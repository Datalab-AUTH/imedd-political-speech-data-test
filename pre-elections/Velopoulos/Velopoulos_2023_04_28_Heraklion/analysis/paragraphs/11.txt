I have a statement which has just slipped through the fingers of Mr Roubini, who said something shocking. He talked about an artificial crisis with Greece after the elections. This is what the Greek solution has been saying for many, many years that we will enter into a dialogue with Turkey whether it is good or bad. The PASOK and New Democracy and SYRIZA parties do not mention national issues at all. It is a strange peculiar regime, this history of political parties not mentioning national issues. It is unacceptable that 6 nautical miles east of Crete should be considered a disputed area, following the memorandum of understanding signed by Greece on the Greek-Egyptian EEZ. Why am I saying this? The agreement anyway. Because we have a reduced influence. When you have a reduced influence, that is to say, when you have a reduced EEZ, you are bound to lose national sovereignty. That is what the new democracy has done.
