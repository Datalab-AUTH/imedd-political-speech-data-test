The latest proof is from netflix, where Cleopatra is presented as an African empress and Egypt officially asked netflix for an explanation saying that her presence is Hellenistic and Greek and only Egypt complained. Cleopatra, for those who know, is Ptolemy from Macedonia and apparently the Skopjeans will also protest and Greece is absent and silent. So we expect the Egyptians to save the honour and reputation of Greek history. I say this, not because of colour. But mainly for the origin. When you say that the civilization, the Hellenistic civilization, has an African origin, you have a matter of historical seriousness.
