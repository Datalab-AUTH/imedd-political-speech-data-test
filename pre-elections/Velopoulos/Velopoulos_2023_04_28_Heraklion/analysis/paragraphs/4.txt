If Cretans knew how important it is to be Cretan, Crete would be different. You delivered civilization with linear A and linear b, you gave the lights to Greek civilization. This is where the civilization of Greece began. As the donors of Greek civilization, the parties and the state must honor Crete. This is what we will do in our advertising message, our campaign spot. That is, to use this opportunity to communicate the message of Crete throughout Greece and the world.
