Unfortunately, the people who govern Greece don't know the obvious, they don't know what the economy means and they themselves, in any case, new democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA are responsible for the bankruptcy of the Greeks. They are responsible for the misery of the Greeks. They are responsible for all the suffering that the three-party government has brought to the country and I am sure despite whatever petty differences they have and have between them that they will rule you. You can see that SYRIZA, New Democracy and PASOK do not disagree on the major issues. They disagree on the small things. They take small approaches to the big issues, they avoid talking about them and only talk about the small ones. The insignificant ones in our view. Because it is insignificant an issue of university police, to the importance of the poverty of Greeks, the lack of wages to regulators and the lack of good living of the Greek.
