So while we are sitting and discussing all these small things that are very big for our historical tradition, a municipality in Skopje decided to use the sun of Macedonia as a symbol of the municipality. While this symbol became a reason for the Supreme Court to throw a party out of the elections. I find all that is happening unthinkable, tragic. You cannot throw parties out of parliament because they have a symbol without being able to correct it. Of course, a national symbol, a Greek symbol. It's not a symbol which, nor a trademark could be used by a company. And to prove the point, there is an attempt to undermine the cultural and heritage tradition.
