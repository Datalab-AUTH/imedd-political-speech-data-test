And I challenge all the political leaders because it's been announced that there's going to be a debate. Let them tell me what I'm going to say. In public. The Greek Solution. They are neither pro-American, nor pro-Russian, nor pro-German, nor pro-Filipino, nor anything else, they are only Greeks and they are putting themselves forward. The national interest will dare the Prime Minister and the other political leaders to say the same thing, that is, that it is the national interest first and then the interest of the Americans or the Russians, not because they are unfortunately subservient to the foreign factor. That is the reality and that is the reality that we will serve to the end. Thank you all and if you have. Any questions, am I at your disposal?
