Let's go to the rest because it's important. We denounced it yesterday and no channel broadcast it. So here's that story again. How does New Democracy control the channels? The saying, Ours. It goes along with a leading statement. Gigashvili, I don't know if you know it. Great figure for many on the left, who said it doesn't matter who votes, but who counts the votes. So, the company that took over? The vote counting, Singular. It's sure that with the new software it got with no audit it can make it very simple for 2 to vote and record one. So we asked the other parties in the bipartisan committee in writing with a memo to bring in experts and find out if there is software that is compromising the counting. It is a well-known fact that New Democracy, the party of eavesdropping, the party of the misdirectors, not as a party, New Democracy, but as the logical mentality of Mr Mitsotakis, is the logic of corruption, of rot, of subservience to the Turks and, worst of all, of clinging to the chair. We have asked in a memo to our technical advisers that we all have technical advisers to check this software story. Because the company that took over and because I am also a neighbor of the man who owns the company in Thessaloniki. Does he have the capabilities to do what we are telling you? The memo is on the Internet. We have posted it. So we are waiting to see what happens with that as well.
