First of all, thank you all for being here today. This is probably the worst election period for all parties. Beyond the climate of toxicity. I fear that this election will be perhaps the last election we have as a democracy. I begin this way because it is unacceptable to let the Supreme Court reject parties. And it is unacceptable for democracy. The New Republic by law of its own to exclude party formations because they are not to its liking. We call. The parties that were excluded from the process, the election after May 21, to make a nationwide rally of national patriotic parties against these people who are only interested in the chair, business and, worst of all, to lead the country to co-optation in the Aegean. We find what is happening with the Supreme Court unacceptable. I say this, I underline it and I am afraid that we are going down a slippery slope. Real apostasy and distancing from democracy. I just want to ask the Prime Minister something. The Supreme Court, which is controlled by him anyway, because the selection of the Supreme Court is made by certain centres and by the government in particular, has allowed a party that declares itself Turkish to stand. In other words, a Turkish party, as it declares itself, can run and gets the permission of the Supreme Court, but any Greek party, whether we disagree with it or the Greek people decide, must be excluded. I will say it one more time. I call on all parties that were cut after 21 May. Let the presidents leave their chairs and I don't know what else and let us all rally together against the common enemy, because the common enemy is one and it is called New Democracy, not as a party, but the Mitsotakis family. Mr Mitsotakis is the perpetrator of the crime against democracy. I am starting in this way, because there has to be an all-out campaign against what is coming, and what is coming is much worse than the Greeks imagine.
