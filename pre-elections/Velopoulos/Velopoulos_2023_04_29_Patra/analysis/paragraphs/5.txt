So if we are talking about black money or direct commissioning, we must recall what happened yesterday in the eyes of surprised workers in an insurance company. The minister, Mr Georgiades, went and, no sooner or later, threatened the workers that they would have to vote for a new democracy to prevent Syriza from coming out. What did the government hide that 7000 plus 100? According to the information, state cars were insured by this company. Everything is coincidental but also everything is coincidental. A rot that this party does not realize that it exists and unfortunately the last voter of New Democracy is participating on May 21, in the effort to shake off the rot, corruption, black money, offshore companies.
