I would also like to say because we are acquaintances in the street and I know you will ask me that Mr Vourliotis is an old acquaintance of mine from 1997. At the time when they wanted to rename Apostolos Pavlos Street to Kemal Atat√ºrk, because I was the main cause of the reaction, he tried to put me on trial six times. All six times I was acquitted. He deliberately made refutations on purpose I will tell Mr. Vourliotis that if he is looking in the bogs to find money Black or White, let him look in New Democracy, in the cigarette oil smugglers that he covers up for and most important of all, we buy him coffee transparent crystal, because we are simply tired of saying and I will say it once again that the finances of the parties by 3 independent companies are audited every six months. So Mr. Vourliotis either doesn't know economics which he doesn't know anyway or he's a New Democracy pistol. No other excuse can be valid if he is a New Democracy pistol. Mr Vourliotis should be told that we will be facing him one way or the other, and in the coming days we will hear a lot about Mr Vourliotis and about New Democracy with facts and not speculation. I would also like to say that this is the first time in my life that I have heard that the salary of a Member of Parliament is black money. There is no such thing and Mr Vourliotis needs to be told by someone next to him that. Parties are not taxed, so they cannot move black money. It is simple advice. We repeat, we are willing, we have been looking for him since yesterday afternoon for Mr. Vourliotis himself, the party's Finance Director to call him himself to go to the offices to check what he wants is missing because the job is done.
