Of course I have to say this. To understand which party we're talking about and what the corruption is, picture one. A company in Mykonos that trespassed all the land had to pay over 20 million euros in fines and on the last day before Parliament closed, the New Democracy party made an amendment. are you listening, Mr Vrouliotis, to pay 500 euros? Mr Vourliotis, if you are listening to this, it is a scandal. Mykonos scandals with an amendment by the New Democracy, another scandal, do you see this here? The teleconferencing of Mr Gerapetritis, the most unreliable politician and he is not a politician. Tarpaulins behind what the New Republic has denounced for tarpaulins behind what Mr. Gerapetritis has tarpaulins for telecommuting. And third. See who serves the funds that take the homes of Greeks. How has Intrum been increasing its revenues for the last 2-3 years? Hundreds of millions of euros are being taken from the homes of Greeks by funds whose names are on them. Only Hellenic Solution revealed in the Parliament all others are silent, because everyone is involved and SYRIZA and PASOK and New Democracy are all involved, why is it really a wonder at the audacity of New Democracy and all of them? Who talk about transparency and are not even ashamed of it, please.
