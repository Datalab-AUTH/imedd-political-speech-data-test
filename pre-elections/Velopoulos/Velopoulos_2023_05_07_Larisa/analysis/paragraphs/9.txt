today the Greek prime minister, the lying prime minister from Chalkida, calling her yesterday, spoke, listen to the dilemma of the elections and said that we must continue to go forward. Should we go back? The lying Prime Minister forgets that our country's debt has exceeded 415 million euros. The lying Prime Minister forgets, and I repeat, that his party owes EUR 400 million or more in maritime loans. And if everything he says is not a lie, then the man and he is sane. Tash brakes has a problem of perception one of 2 or he is lying or he does not understand what he says and what he has done, What damage has democracy done to the country
