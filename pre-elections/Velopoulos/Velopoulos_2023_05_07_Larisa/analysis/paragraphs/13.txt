I say that, why? Because we must not forget that today in Cyprus Americans have started drilling. This says it all, and we still have Mr Mitsotakis, who have now remembered the national issues that are not discussed, of course, and are avoiding discussing them in the media. And it seems strange to me because national issues don't sell. It makes sense that national issues are not being sold, since these gentlemen are selling Greece and are selling it out everywhere - they have sold out Macedonia, they have sold out Northern Epirus, they are selling out the Aegean. Now they have sold out Cyprus, they will sell out everything to stay in their chairs. So I also see an agreement between Greece and Turkey that proves that the new democracy is now acting in a minority way, neither submissively nor appeasingly, in a minority way towards Turkey. Turkey will refrain from violating international law and good neighbourly relations with Greece. Turkish aircraft will stay out of Greek airspace, and Greece will refrain from exercising its sovereign rights, and I ask the new democracy, is this true, Mr. Dendias? And Mr Mitsotakis, yes or no? Is this commitment valid, yes or no?
