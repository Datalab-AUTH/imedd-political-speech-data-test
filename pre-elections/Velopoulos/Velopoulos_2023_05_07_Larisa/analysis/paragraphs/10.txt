Also? I have to say about Mr Tsipras. That it is too late for tears.Yesterday Mr Tsipras from Kozani copied our proposal and said the following. I will postpone the end date of the fifth unit in Ptolemaida, because the energy mix cannot be without lignite. The man who in his programme says he will abolish lignites now said yesterday, another liar. Potential prime minister wants to be says he will bring back the speakers, while in his programme he is clear about abolishing lignites listen their abdirism is clear, and I say abdirism to look a little Greek. What does abdiritism mean as it was done in ancient Abdera, the inhabitants of this city. The proyhods, like Mitsotakis, decided to make the most beautiful fountains. Too much money with marble, with a key to make the water run and the waterfalls sound in the city. But they forgot something very simple: the city had no water. They built, that is, they gave all the money from the funds to build marbles, granites, fountains and the fountains were left without water. So does the new democracy and SYRIZA promise everything to everyone, but they themselves cannot produce wealth.
