This is not the state that the Greek solution envisions, this Greek solution talks about a meritocratic state, a state where better people can get and occupy positions. That is why I often insist on the Athens parastate, which hates the province. I am squarely on this parastate and the Athens para system hates the whole province, does not want the province and it is the first time in the political history of the country that still from the province. It is in Athens and the saying of a top minister that we shouldn't let Velopoulos run Athens says it all. They think that the parastate in Athens is their own shop, that no one can intrude there. Nobody can have an opinion and a say, but they are wrong. The Greek people. May 21 will give it its answer and it will be loud. It will be a resounding one no matter what they are working on behind the scenes. Today the press is full of apostasy scenarios. I need not say anything else, but those of you who read the press, which is still free and can write freely, read the scenarios that the machismo is working on. My point of view is redundant and I say redundant because I have been confronted with it in the past few days? Personally myself. and the operation of looting the Greek solution by the back door after the elections, but they are dealing with a man and his team, who know what is going on around them, they got their answer. We soon got the solutions in our hands and cut the Gordian knot. So their panic up created fake parties, since they couldn't get away with apostasy and co-government with the Greek solution, which would never happen at least as long as I was standing.
