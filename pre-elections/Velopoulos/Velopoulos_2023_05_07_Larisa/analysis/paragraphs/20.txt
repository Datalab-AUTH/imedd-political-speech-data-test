And I read. The Commission is asking Greece to put money behind the development of rail safety funding. Why has Greece never implemented this program?57 dead, including my good friend.30 years of friendship with George were lost in Tempe. The problem is not the state, but no. I have a different view now and it has been proven by the facts. It is the short memory of the Greeks. Greeks forget. That week was the week of shock. A month and a half passed and we all forgot. The Greeks forgot the young children, the flower of the society of Northern Greece. Is it possible for Greeks to forget 57 innocent victims? And not to get angry and not to remember who is responsible. Is it possible that there is a Greek who does not feel sorry for his neighbour who lost his child? These neo-Greeks don't really deserve to exist in my opinion. Greek has philotimo, has a heart, 57 dead and now the money back. So vote again for the new democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA.And then don't say it's not your fault, all of you, all the citizens who approve of these choices who approve of the crime against Greece with their vote? So, on May 21, for our Greece there is a solution, the Greek solution.
