And our promise is that the 500 billion euros of mineral wealth will not be plundered by the oligarchs, nor by the canal lords, nor by the wealthy of Athens, the Athenian parastate. The Greeks will eat it up and reap money and another 500 billion. What do I mean? You can not give wind turbines on the money of the Greek 10 billion euros direct awarding about 10 billion euros in photovoltaic parks have done the whole plain with photovoltaic, when it is known that there is no way at least in wind turbines to store the electricity, the OPER means that it turns the turbine and does not produce energy because it can be stored. Why not give it to the farmer you guys This money when I give 1 â‚¬ to the farmer, The surplus value of the product becomes 7 when I give ONE EURO to the wind turbine surplus value becomes zero 10 no relation. And the farmer is the one who can produce surplus value of products, pyramid kind this year one to 7 next year 7 will become more 7 will become 10.
