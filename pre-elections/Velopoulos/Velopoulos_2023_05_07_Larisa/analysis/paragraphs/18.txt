I say this in very simple terms, so that they understand that the 500 billion euros that we have copied the Norwegian model. What did Norway do and pensioners get a pension of 4.05 thousand euros, when in Greece the farmer gets 400 euros with hardly any money.I made it very simple, I linked the extraction of gas with a big rate with the pension funds and so these funds have 4 5 thousand euros and they all get 4 and 5000 euros in Norway because they have gas. Why should we do it in Greece? Why should Greece do that? And it's rhetoric. The answer and the question only the Greek solution wants to do it only we want to do it. Everybody else wants to bury it and we want to dig it up.
