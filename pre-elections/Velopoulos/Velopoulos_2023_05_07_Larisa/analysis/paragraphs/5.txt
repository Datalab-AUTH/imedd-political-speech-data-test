We will continue. We will keep talking, we will keep shouting and, most importantly, we will keep reminding in every direction. That Greece today is among the 5 worst European countries in terms of journalism. This does not honor, not the journalists, the journalists. Unfortunately, they are employees, they are under others, but to the publishers, these rodents of the country, that's what I call them. Unfortunately, it is an unfortunate truth about the reality that they left Greek journalism and Greek information in the clutches of the New Democracy of Mr. Mitsotakis. What is happening with information Greece really can only happen in third world countries. Only in the world, in the world, which is really in a deplorable state; reporting, sick, democracy, sick, corruption triumphs.
