That's all I had to say. I just want to say something that all the channels have hidden.And that's a strange thing. Strange. Okay, in a Greece of channel masters, oligarchs and all the things that we proposed. They give 9 million euros to the nationwide channels.We proposed to the bipartisan committee 2 things. One is that one third should go to the regional channels, the 9 million was refused and we also proposed that the advertising messages paid for by the state of the parties should be shared again in this way they cannot get 5 million from advertising and another 9 million. All this the Athens Paramounty to take it must be taken by the region No party, no party supported us, I tell you none, so it was bad to take 3 million about one hundred and 110 channels informative because there are other channels that are their OTHER job informative in the region so bad was it now so the Athens Paramounty will take all this H? That's our difference. Because we're a party of the province, we support the province.
