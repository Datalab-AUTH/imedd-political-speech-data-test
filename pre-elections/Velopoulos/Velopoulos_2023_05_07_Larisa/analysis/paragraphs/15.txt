I'll tell you this. To show you how they're killing Greece, I don't know if I can show it, but I'll show you this is a graphic example of how as GDP falls, the demographics collapse and the birth rate falls.Greece is dying and they're not giving incentives to have Greeks, the biggest problem of the country, apart from the economic problem that can be solved. As I said, it is demographics. They want to fill Greece with hotspots, they want to fill Greece with Pakistanis, Afghans and Somalis. We want Greeks to be born - it's our qualitative differences, our substantial differences.
