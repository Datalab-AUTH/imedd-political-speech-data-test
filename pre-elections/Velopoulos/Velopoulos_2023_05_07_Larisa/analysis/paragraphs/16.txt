and in closing, I have to say the unpleasant things and Thessaly I was informed that about 60 million less will be given to the farmers. Hold on to your hats when I was saying this? When Velopoulos and the Greek solution were saying it. Some people were making fun of me, I was saying that hunger is coming, that the farming world must be supported, that it must be supported. Livestock farming must be supported, fishing must be supported because it is the primary stage of economic development. Those who read a little history understand what I am saying. Let them read Xenophon's economics, let them read Thucydides. If you don't help the farmer to produce products if you don't give him tax-free oil to keep his production costs low, if you don't give it to the farmer, if you don't give it to the fisherman, then we are finished.
