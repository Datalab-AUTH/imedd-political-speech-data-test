I say this because I have been telling them for a very long time that Greece must produce wealth. I say to you that the Greek solution, we say to you as the Greek solution, Greece has huge gas reserves, everyone is now saying that. Fifty Billion EUR money of the Greek people, which we must give back to the Greeks, the Greeks can eat with golden spoons and be rich. The mineral wealth that all the channels are hiding mainly in the nationwide, they bury the issue and that is what makes me angry. It is 500 billion euros. This money can be made in two 3 4 years with mining. The New Democracy does not want mining, Syriza does not want mining, the other parties do not want mining, only we want gas extraction and we want this money to go to the Greek people in their pockets. Mr. Ellelides, Mr. Foskolos. The University of Houston Geological Survey, the Deutche Bank in the past talk about 500 billion euros. There are deposits. So I say that we want to give them to the Greeks New Democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA want to take us into coexploitation with the Turks and give them to the Turks.
