And the second thing I have to say is that Mr. Dendias' statement is politicism. Mr. Dendias says, Greece has the rights that the English gives it and does not negotiate with another country or English is the Convention on the Law of the Sea and refers to the Greek EEZ. It says the tree itself, which brought reduced influence to the country, that is, it crippled the country with the reduced influence of the EEZ. It really appeals to a people who under the door want and the difficulty of economic hardship forget everything. They don't remember.
