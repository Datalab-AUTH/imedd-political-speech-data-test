I say this because the government and the opposition are divided. I said it yesterday from Thrace, where I was in Alexandroupolis, Komotini, Xanthi and Kavala, and they are possessed by the syndrome of abdominism. They promise everything to everyone nonsense of people who cannot produce wealth and produce debts. Today I heard the Prime Minister say that if elected he will reduce VAT on consumer goods. Until yesterday the lying Prime Minister was saying that this could not be done. Today the Prime Minister has found out today what we were telling him, namely about VAT.
