This morning I don't know how many people watched, Elon Musk put up a tweet on Twitter and it shows a road, a road that one side they all follow together like a herd and sheep and another road. The lonely road to success and Musk said that at some point in life you have to choose the road that leads to success even if it is a lonely road. So the Greek solution has chosen the lonely, difficult way for a very long time. This way that we are treated by the system as a difficulty for this parastate of Athens and the system of Athens treats the Greek solution with hatred. And with envy but also with insults without arguments. This shows that we are causing them panic. I've been reading infinite fake news its been seeing fake news and fake parties lately. Because the new republic in their panic is trying to create the I repeat, impressions we will not follow them.
