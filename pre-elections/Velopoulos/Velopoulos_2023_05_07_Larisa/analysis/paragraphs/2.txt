What I want to stress is that unfortunately we are confirmed as the Greek solution for what has happened in the last few days.We understand that there is a lack of reasoning from the big parties in power, the ones that ruled because the big party is pretending to speak.We understand the difficulty they have in talking to the Greek people with arguments. But we cannot understand this falling into the mire of rivalry, insults and slander. I hear among them a boyish, boyish discourse that is particularly disturbing to me. Of course I expected it because in the last two months, in the context of their collaborations and who will work with whom, one with the other, with one or alone? They had to entrench their party audience and they found the worst way the vulgar way to insult each other. We will never go along with that logic.
