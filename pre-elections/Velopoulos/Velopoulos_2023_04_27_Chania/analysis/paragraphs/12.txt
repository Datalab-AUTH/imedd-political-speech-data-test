And there's another big problem that nobody has focused on. They don't know it basically; the problem with the political staff and the leaders of the parties living far away from society. They don't know basic problems of the legal economy, it's called greed inflation. What does it mean? Companies use inflation as an excuse to be able to increase their profits, i.e. they increase prices because of inflation. But that's a lie because the government's economic policy can control it directly, directly, but what they do is they make triangular relationships between the food industry, the middlemen, the middlemen, to raise the price of the product from the manufacturing plant to the selling price. We used to have the farmer producer delivering to the supermarket or somewhere else, or the grocery store. Now we have the farmer going to the wholesaler. The wholesaler, the food processing company. The food industry standardizes and they ship it anywhere. So therefore the chain has grown, so making more profit, everybody is still taking the product from 1 € to 3 €. Here I have to say this though, because I have examples. The gross EBITDA margin on revenue of a manufacturing group increased 4%. Listen to the gross margin. By 4%. gross margin by 5%. The publicly traded food industry attributes last year's increase in operating costs. What are they doing, increasing their operating expenses? What does that mean? When they increase operating costs, for those who know economics, I don't know if Mitsotakis knows economics or Mr. Tsipras, but when the company increases operating costs, they pass that increase in operating costs on; to the product.
