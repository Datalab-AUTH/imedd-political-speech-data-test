I must also say that the government is suffering and is suffering the Greek people every day with the back and forth. Of course, the government is not the only problem. Even SYRIZA, watching Mr Tsipras this morning on Antenna because, I want to watch everyone and read what everyone else is saying so that I at least know where we stand and where we are. I heard Mr Tsipras and SYRIZA as a whole talk about the renationalisation of the PPC. The question that is relentlessly asked is when can a politician lie? Because the large share of the PPC was given under the SYRIZA government to the Ypertifond, i.e. the PPC was led to a privatization through the PPC and now wants to re-nationalize it.
