Let me tell you that we pushed for the regional channels.I am still waiting for the answer to give paid advertising messages in the region of the parties, since the parties receive money from subsidies, this money should not stay in Athens. It is a disgrace that the Athens-centric system reaps all the election money and not the region. Until now you know regional channels and media, newspapers did not get election money and had to resort to other methods through candidates. These should be stopped in the country and since the funds are there, they should be given directly by the parties for their promotion.
