Unfortunately, we are going through an election period which is full of minefields. I believe that the government system is blowing its horns and it is evident from the jerky moves through which it acts and operates at many levels, especially at the level of channel control. It is being done overtly now. We had an incident yesterday on Mega, where the 2 candidates of day 25 and our candidate, while called in at noon the first time, were cancelled after half an hour. He was called again the second time to go on the show, he was cancelled the second time. He was called back a third time, cancelled again. This means that they don't want pluralism and of course the mainstream media, I understand this because their interconnectedness is mainly focused and rooted in the parties in power, those who ruled, that is, PASOK, New Democracy and Syriza. But it bothers me that it has now gone beyond the limit of, you know, the choice of "who to listen to"? But we're going into a gagging process; let's be bipartisan, things didn't go very well. It's well known that the bipartisan which includes the FCC is a bipartisan committee in which the government mainly decides how the process is going to be done.
