Some of the politicians in Parliament and many of the front-runners don't get a whiff of what's going on around them. I was brought up in a village. I am proud to be a provincial. From Old Milltown. I've come a long way in my life because I've been working since I was 26 years old. I work, I have companies. I'm not like other people. So, because we caught on and because we figured out what happened. We cut the Gordian knot ourselves. There was no room for defections when for four years I screamed and shouted that we would not co-govern with anyone and the new democracy. So we do not allow anyone to denigrate the members who love the Greek solution, the cadres who love Greece, to have any of us, whether high or low, in the mood to look left and right. Anyone who looks askance is walking away from the Greek solution. Full stop.We are not going on just because I am going to be asked to tell you that in my life I have learned to ask and answer questions with obvious questions. When a publication implicates you, not just one, there were many, it implicates you in a defection. You are obliged. The first order of business is to sue and sue and sue out of court because you are involved in apostasy. To this day there is no such lawsuit from the gentlemen who are alleged to have been the apostates. So we are therefore heading into government clean, transparent, crystal clear, without weights. Let's be clear, we will not be in government with any of them. Period, Paula.
