All these are messages that the government should take seriously, because the central banker, the fabius panetta of the European Central Bank, comes out and makes a statement that foreshadows an earthquake, but our people are mainly concerned with Tsipras, Mitsotakis, with the small things and not with the big things. Or Mr Androulakis. There are sectors where costs are falling while retail prices are rising and their profits are also rising and the CEO of Société Générale comes out and says the main driver of this inflation is due to rising profit margins. That's what I was telling you before. Companies are raising profit margins above the normal level and this is happening in Greece, especially with the food industries. Because by the same reasoning, the farmer should get more money, because his costs have gone up, but the farmer is getting less than last year, at the unit price. I am saying this, it may sound complicated. I will not bore you with illustrations and generalisations and arithmetic of the grey arguments of the other parties. We, in order to be able to govern, have to find the cause to solve the problem. That is the difference in the Greek solution. We do not want to cure the result. The result cannot be cured. The cause is cured of the disease. they don't even know the basics and as long as Greece doesn't produce it will produce debt and memoranda. This is our basic objection to everything that is being reported regarding the economy. On the other hand I must say that it must seem absurd to many of you.
