First, they invited a representative of Taiwan to the Delphi Forum. How is it possible to invite Taiwan, which is in the eye of the cyclone, in relation to China? Because the Americans are all over it? Why should I go into this spin? What is the reason? It's not enough that Crete and Souda have become, I'll say it, fifty-third province or fifty-fourth with Alexandroupolis, bases of Americans, we call Taiwan. We have tension with Russia, to sharpen our relations with Russia. What for? What do I gain as a country? That is what Mr Tsipras, Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Androulakis, who are not talking, should tell me. They say nothing, they do not react.
