The only solution to increase wages is for the country to produce real wealth, if we don't give a basis to the primary sector, the agricultural economy, the livestock economy, the fishing economy, which are economies of scale, economies of surplus value, that is, when you produce an agricultural product €1 can become after a year €7 of surplus value. That is where the investment is, not in the provision of a service. And this is proven by the wrong choices of the government, which in the Recovery Fund, the biggest piece of the pie of the funding that was given, 80% of the money was taken, that is, 300 companies and something in Greece. When there are 800,000 SMEs that are not being granted by any bank.
