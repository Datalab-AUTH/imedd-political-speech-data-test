Because quite simply the big 3, big God willing, small for the needs of Greece, have agreed to co-exploitation in the Aegean, to the sharing of the Aegean. And especially since they started from our Crete and no Cretan says, unfortunately, politician, but not only that east of Crete is no longer Crete. It is a disputed area, because we have made a reduced influence with Egypt and because we have not included in the EEZ of Greece in our Cyprus. So it is a disputed area. Hence the statements of Gerapetritis the most credible politician I have ever met in my life who talked about 6 nautical miles in Crete, continental shelf. Why does he keep telling us about maritime zones? Why is the Minister talking about maritime zones and not specific issues that should be of concern? End of EEZ. And here I have to say that they are committing crimes. I said it yesterday on a hospitable channel in Crete, to Mr Sakhinis, the gentlemen of the new democracy have committed two successive national crimes.
