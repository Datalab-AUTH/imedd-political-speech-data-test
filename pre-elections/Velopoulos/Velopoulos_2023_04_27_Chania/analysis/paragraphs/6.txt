The second thing I want to stress is that it is today that I listened to Mr Mitsotakis, who for months has been giving the familiar pass. Mr Varoufakis is talking about Executioners, Mr Tsipras talked about euros, he will give euros to the Greeks. Listen. The philosophy of a political leader must be one and the same, to know how to tell the truth. Certain political leaders cannot give money to the Greeks because they themselves cannot produce money and cannot enter into this process.
One wants a job, one wants a decent salary, but most importantly the country wants wealth production. I have not heard any model from these 3 parties of wealth production and if Greece does not produce wealth we are unfortunately driving day by day in a death spiral and it is shown by the economic distress. I will give 2, 3 examples for all Greeks to understand.
