The second issue is the disruption of already strained relations with our friend Serbia. It is unthinkable to invite a Serbian Prime Minister to the Delphi Forum while you are participating in a crime against Serbia with Kosovo. This is unthinkable. While Spain and other European countries stood by Serbia and Vucic. So why did I have to go into this spin as a country? Why doesn't the Prime Minister ask anyone? After all, the government is finished. There is no more government, we have a caretaker government that is constantly committing national crimes and blunders.
