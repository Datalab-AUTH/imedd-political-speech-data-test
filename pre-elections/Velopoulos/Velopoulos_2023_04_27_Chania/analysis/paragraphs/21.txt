Just to tell you that the Greek solution was attempted by the new democracy to become part of what Mr.Tsipras, Mr.Varoufakis, Mr.Koutsoumpas, said, an apostasy that was born a few months ago. Unfortunately, the new democracy has not understood what a Greek solution means. It doesn't mean that. The new democracy doesn't understand that the leader of the Greek solution, but also the executives are people who think much faster than Mr Mitsotakis. Does the Prime Minister and the team he has next to him, the parastatals, the parahumans of the apostasy, not understand that for us above all and above all is our homeland. Because our Greece is Greece first and Greeks first and because, I will say it in layman's terms, and let the cameras be on.
