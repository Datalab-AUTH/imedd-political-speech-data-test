When the Recovery Fund or what I call the "plunder of the money" of the Europeans goes to wind turbines to be erected on the high mountain or on the mountains of Crete or on the mountains of Epirus. Anarchistically, without a plan, the Commission, the European Commission, then comes along and fines you 100 million euros a year for putting wind turbines in Natura areas. Greece, nobody says it, pays 100 million people say it is around 9 million a month, because we put wind turbines on Natura areas. This shows what? Their feverishness to make money. Their friends, I am not saying themselves and I have no proof of that. Their friends and their friends say they have energy companies, wind turbine companies, gas companies, some poisons, they are bribing them and the Greek is starving. We are not going anywhere like this.
