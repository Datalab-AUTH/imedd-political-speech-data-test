Strange I would say that none of the 3 parties competing for the small ones talk about national issues. No mention of operational matters. And the mainstream journalists, Polakis calls them bovine, I avoid such terms. Today's mainstream journalists never raise questions about Greek-Turkish issues, when. Is it a systemic mandate that no Greek-Turkish issues should be put on the table?
