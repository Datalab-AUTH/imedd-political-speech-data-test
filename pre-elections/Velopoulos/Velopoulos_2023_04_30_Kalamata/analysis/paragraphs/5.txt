So, from yesterday, the Greek Solution. Overcoming any personal mood that each of us may have. Any personal or party interest. It calls all Greeks, the parties that were cut off, to re-unite and to join in a pan-army. To join forces after May 21 to strike at the whole horizontal system that has a certain point of view. An anti-national unpopular view, with measures that create a huge problem for Greece and the Greeks and we say to them after May 21, leave the presidential elections, leave the chairman's views and perceptions and come under the umbrella of Greece to unite together to create the great Greek patriotic party. The Hellenic Solution, realizing the debt to Greece, took the first step on May 21 then after the elections. The process of unification of the patriotic forces must be initiated. There can be no baby-faced ambitions. Vanities can create obstacles to this patriotic call. So we shall see what happens from there? That's all I could say as an introduction. On many different subjects.
