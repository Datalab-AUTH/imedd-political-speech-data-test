The second one that occurred and was shut down by the channels at the very same forum conference by Mr. Tsounis, the Greek-American. He said that yes, Turkey should get F16s. To end the story. Keep the 2 statements. They are a prelude to what will happen after May 21. Co-exploitation in the Aegean with Turkey is coming. A coalition of the 3 parties is coming, 2 certainly 3 if need be, because they now agree on everything and disagree on a few. Where they disagree. In their hypocrisy. Who is more of a hypocrite and liar when I see a Syriza TV spot? On red loans. SYRIZA's that did. And that's what's weird and hypocritical about electronic auctions. That he arrested by order of Mr. Tsipras those who disagreed. So the one who did the electronic auctions today says, will he change the law to save us?
