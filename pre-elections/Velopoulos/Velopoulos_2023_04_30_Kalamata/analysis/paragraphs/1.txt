Thank you all for being here today to make a brief summary and introduction of course in relation to what we have seen in Kalamata and Messinia as a whole. We are over-optimistic now, not just optimistic. We are walking around without riot police and without a flag, as other political leaders do. City by city, people by people, because we believe that this is where we can really find the Greeks, who are having a difficult time at this particular time, so that we can be close to them, so that we can listen to them. It is very important that Greeks, especially political leaders and politicians, listen to the problems of the citizens.
