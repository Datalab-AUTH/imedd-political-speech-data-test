I'll just mention one, if you'll allow me. The one that they keep hiding on the channels and I'm sorry, but I'll show it. Here you see the American ambassador, the Greek-American is Tzounis with Mr. Tsipras. Here are the two of them at the Delphi Forum. A forum of dubious usefulness for our national, mostly national, issues. There have been two incidents that no channel, not even the New Democracy's, have shown. The first event was Mr Tsipras' statement that he does not want mining in Greece. He does not want mining; we are talking about trillions of euros of Greek money that we can give to 10 million million Greeks and they can live with golden spoons. We are talking about 3 trillion euros stored in the depths of the Greek earth and he does not want mining. So Mr Tsipras is in line with the earlier statements of Mr Dendias and Mr Mitsotakis, no mining in Greece for gas or other hydrocarbons.
