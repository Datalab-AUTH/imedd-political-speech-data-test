The second is the effort and I see it being broadcast on many Greek Solution sites today. To ensure the integrity of the elections. Singular is not the company that Greek democracy can rely on. It is a company that is corrupt in the sense that it has family connections. The company that bought it with the Prime Minister's entourage. We must and we have submitted it to the bipartisan committee to have a software audit from September, cries Hellenic Solution and the speaker you see before you. That they have installed software that can steal the election. And I say it so bluntly. We begged Mr. Tsipras. And the other parties in the bipartisan to have the software tested by independent experts. We are sounding the alarm about election theft are they capable of anything when their MPs admit defections? It is certain that in order to govern and to be able to win them or their friends billions of euros from the Recovery Fund they are capable of anything. The Greek Solution does not play with the institutions. The Greek Solution is institutionally democratic. This is the party that will change Greece. I am waiting for the reactions of the other parties, because if Mr. Tsipras does not speak. If the other parties do not speak, it means that they too are participants and accomplices in a rigged election. And I say so, crudely staged. Let's get our roles straight a little bit.
