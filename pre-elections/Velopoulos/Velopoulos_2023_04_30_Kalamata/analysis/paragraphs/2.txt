We'll start with the politics. This morning we had a blunt admission by a New Democracy candidate, Mr Kaouki, of apostasy. Mr Kaoukis told a television channel that if New Democracy does not get the necessary MPs, it will get them from other parties. And indirectly confirmed the communication Mylonakis, as he said indirectly with New Democracy. So, this means that the ethics committee did very well in this story. It was perceived as a defection. People who were supposedly in the Hellenic Solution, but were working for other parties. And we make it clear once again in every direction and especially to the Prime Minister and his entourage. Their namesakes. Under another name. Of the alleged renegades that the Hellenic Solution will not accept any but no crack in its unbroken front for government. We will not co-govern, we want to govern Greece. For the benefit of the Greeks and not for the benefit of foreign agents or foreign countries. So this blunt admission should make the Prime Minister realize that he cannot play with institutions and parties. Shame on New Democracy, this historic, but more shame on the prime minister's entourage. That is where its rot and the country's difference begins.
