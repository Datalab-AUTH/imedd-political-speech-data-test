The third one, which for me is very important and I will say it now. I learn that the Supreme Court. He left. A party that declares itself Turkish to run in the elections. So you allow parties that are anti-national, since they declare themselves Turkish to run in elections and you reject them with ridiculous excuses? Other parts that have another opinion. The parts that were cut. They have a stance on national issues, especially Macedonia, the Aegean and exploitation. What the Greek Solution has been saying for many, many years. And they are parties that have a patriotic view and discourse. The parties that were cut are parties that would have created a problem for Mr Mitsotakis and his party, which is not New Democracy. The parties that passed are parties that are fluid. National perception I am not talking about the Turkish party that had to get out anyway. I cannot understand what judge can let a party that has another national consciousness go free in our national elections. But to prevent other parties.
