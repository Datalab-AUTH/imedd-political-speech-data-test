The workers feel this very well "under their own skin" here in Crete. The thousands of hotel and tourism workers who have been working for a month now and have started the tourist season and do not know if and how they will finish it. Because it is still May and the organisations of the KKE, the unions do not have time to register the complaints about working from sun to sun, 7 days without days off, in miserable conditions.
