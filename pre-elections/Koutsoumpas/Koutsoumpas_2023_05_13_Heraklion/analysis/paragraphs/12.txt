After they have all together created the whole anti-labour arsenal that ensures the squeezing of hotel employees and the annihilation of self-employed workers, now the Southwest is advertising that it will send the "rambos" of the control mechanisms to be the traffic police of its implementation!.
What should we be reminded of:
- The PASOK government in 2011 abolished the heavy and unhealthy for industry specialties cooks, maids.
- The ND-PASOK coalition government in 2012 abolished in substance the sectoral agreements and the National General Collective Labour Agreement and established that the basic wage should be set by ministerial decision.
- The SYRIZA-ANEL government abolished the one-off pension for hotel employees at 20 years of age with the Katrougalos law and fixed the retirement age at 67. It legislated the restriction of the right to strike.
- The last government of the New Democracy with the Hatzidakis law regulating working hours, among other things, put a headstone on the 8-hour and 5-day working week, which had no practical application in hotels anyway. A law that was also voted for by 50% of SYRIZA.
