Crete, which all Greek governments have turned into the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the USA, as they themselves say, and at the same time have turned it into a target of their opponents, is a very characteristic example of what it means for each government to continue where the previous one left off and to take it even further...
We are of course talking about the dangerous Greek-American agreement on bases, prepared by the SYRIZA government and ratified by the ND government. Recently "Rizospastis" published their detailed plans for upgrading and expanding the Souda base, which is planned, in fact, modelled on the NATO "headquarters" for the war in Ukraine, the US base in Ramstein, Germany. The bigger the base, the greater the dangers and insecurity for our people!
And we believe that there is not a single sane person left who believes that there is any chance of our allies moving from their bases to assist in the event of a hot incident with Turkey. No matter how many phone calls any prime minister or Mr Varoufakis makes to them, as he told us he would...
As if there weren't enough phone calls when Cyprus was invaded or in 1996 with Imia... All they will say is "find them", as they have been doing all these years as the aggression of the Turkish bourgeoisie escalates in its confrontation with the Greek ruling class. Because what they are primarily interested in is to keep Turkey in the arms of NATO and away from the arms of Russia, for their own interests.
