Such is democracy in this system... It stops outside the gates of workplaces. But we urge them not to do them any favors. Demand the permission they are entitled to and go vote for the JPC to punish those who want to take away their voice.
Do all the people of Crete finally get their due from this development? Do the tens of thousands of workers in hotels, restaurants and the countless tourist businesses benefit? And if they are, why are they not queuing outside the big businesses looking for work? Why are the big hotel owners here in Crete and all over the country, once again, complaining about tens of thousands of job vacancies?
What prevents - if not the greed and ruthlessness of employers, the goal of speculation - a tourism worker from working 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours, with humane working conditions and wages that meet his needs? Why is it reasonable to work 6 months and have to live 12? Why couldn't tourism and recreation work all year round?
Precisely because, the monopolies want to suck up when and as long as there is incoming increased tourist traffic.
Think how many, how and how much would work if people had access to good, quality holidays all year round! What really prevents a small business from growing and ensuring a good life for a self-employed person working with their family, if not the relentless competition with the industry behemoths?
