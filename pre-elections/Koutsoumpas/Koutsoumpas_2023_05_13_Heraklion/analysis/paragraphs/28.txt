Friends,
compa√±eras and comrades
There are only a few days left until the opening of the ballot box on May 21 and there are days when a lot more can be done by the members and friends of the KKE, in order to take the Party as high as possible. With the ballot papers for each constituency in hand in the days that remain until the last minute, we are organizing an even wider opening to the people and the youth.
Home to home in the districts, post to post in the places of work and study, man to man everywhere, to carry the Party's call for an even stronger JCP, so that the people themselves will be strong on the next election day.
