Friends and friends,
compa√±eras and comrades
We communists have been the first in the battle for the past four years to change all this, to achieve the slightest relief, putting into practice the slogan "only the people save the people". We fought for wage increases, for the signing of Collective Labour Agreements that would put a stop to the physical extermination of workers. For health and safety measures to prevent workers from being crippled, for measures to rehabilitate those affected by natural disasters, for strengthening public hospitals, health centres everywhere, for upgrading the education provided to our children and much more.
