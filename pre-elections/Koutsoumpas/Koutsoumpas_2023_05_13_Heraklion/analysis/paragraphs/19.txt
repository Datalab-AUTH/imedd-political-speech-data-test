The deterioration of the public health care system and the commercialisation of its services, the closed operating rooms and the long wait for an appointment, the huge shortages of staff, the drastic reduction of state spending and the increase in direct and indirect payments by the people for health care are the results of the policies of all governments, which were most tragically demonstrated during the three years of the pandemic.
The culmination of this situation is the bill on secondary care passed by the ND government, which speaks of mergers of hospitals within a short distance, "photographing" Venizelio and the hospitals of the prefecture of Lasithi. This is the reason why the hospital is systematically and consciously being downgraded.
