Friends and friends,
compa√±eras and comrades
One is the great goal of the parties of the system, which are claiming to govern the country in these elections: growth. And because this system is called capitalism, it is about capitalist development. It is around this that they are crossing swords over who is best able to secure it.  Behind this goal, they also call upon the people to fall in line.
But think about it, didn't we have growth in 2022? What did the people gain from that?
They saw their disposable income, the real wage fall by 7.4% according to official figures. For others, of course, the results of growth were very different: More than 10 billion euros in net profits were made by only 150 companies listed on the stock exchange, recording a 10% increase.
