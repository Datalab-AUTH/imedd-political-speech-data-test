We are ready, when the working class, the Greek people choose to do so, to assume our responsibility in a popular governance, where the protagonists will be the producers of wealth themselves and not the drones who suck it away. In such a real power of the workers, where the people will not be a spectator, simply by voting once every four years, where democracy will not stop outside the gates of the factories or at the entrances of department stores and hotels, but every production unit will be a beehive, not only of labour creation, but also of democracy, debate and militant voluntary initiative! In such a governance - power, where the KKE will participate, the elected representatives of the people will be truly accountable to those who elected them.
