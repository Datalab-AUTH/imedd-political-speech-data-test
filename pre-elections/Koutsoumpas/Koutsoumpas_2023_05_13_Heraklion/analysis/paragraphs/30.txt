The people of Crete know well, they can understand that neither will they see "progress" from ND, nor will they see "change" with SYRIZA, nor will their eager tails, PASOK and MERA25, keep their "bosikas".
Never mind that now it seems that the "dividing lines" have now fallen for good. Transfers in the ballot papers of the prefectures of Crete between ND, SYRIZA, PASOK and MERA25 are also on the increase. That's how big - you see - the distances between the bourgeois parties are.
