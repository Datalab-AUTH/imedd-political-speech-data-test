The only real good that can come out of these elections for our people is that the KKE is much stronger! Only then will you yourselves be stronger, to fight together, from better positions, against a policy that is demonstrably unpopular. To open another, better way for us and our children, for the radical changes we need.
Pay no attention to the familiar blackmail and dilemmas that everyone else is putting up to once again steal the popular vote. Do not make their anxiety about 'stability' your own. Their stability is instability for the people's interests.
On the contrary, the weaker, the more unstable the parties of capital, ND, SYRIZA and PASOK and their "complements", the better for all of us.
