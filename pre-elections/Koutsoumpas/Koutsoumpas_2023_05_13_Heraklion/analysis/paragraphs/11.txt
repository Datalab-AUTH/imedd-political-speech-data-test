On the other hand, of course, from very early on hoteliers, tourism entrepreneurs and tour operators are openly talking about a record year in arrivals, revenues and obviously new surpluses, since they had previously received the generous subsidies and tax exemptions for renovations and new investments in green beds from the recovery fund and the state budget. While seasonal workers - who are "rich" according to the governments - received only three months of the slashed unemployment fund and "too much for them", they replied!  Further proof that only moneyed investors, not hard-working workers, can fit within the fiscal constraints and the economy's strengths. This is the common programme of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK. This is the miracle of tourism development for which they all boast and serve together.
