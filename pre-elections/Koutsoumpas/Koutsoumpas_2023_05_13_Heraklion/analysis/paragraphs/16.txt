But the hundreds of earthquake and flood victims of the municipalities of Minoa, Archanes Asterousia, Hersonissos and Malevizi feel the benefits of capitalist development in their own skin. 17 months and counting since the earthquakes in Arkalochori, 6 months since the deadly floods in Agia Pelagia.
It is not only that these people have not yet got back on their feet, but they have been completely abandoned by the government and the local administration. It is that even today no substantial planning for flood and seismic protection of these much-affected areas has been initiated.
