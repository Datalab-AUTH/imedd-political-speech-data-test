We believe that we have offered as much as we could to our people, to the extent of the powers that they have given us. The one and only KKE MP in the whole of Crete, Manolis Syntycheakis, brought all these issues to Parliament, along with many others that concern the people of the region.
Therefore, we invite you to consider whether you have something to gain or lose from the re-election of a KKE MP in Heraklion, from the election of other communist MPs on your island. Crete will only gain!
The position we hold today, our whole action for the people, that we will not become a crutch for any unpopular government is precisely because we have a scientifically elaborated program, a program of another, workers' - people's government - power. We have a programme for a truly pro-people development, free from the profit criterion that creates all these evils.
