It shows, above all, the great difficulty they have in convincing the progressive people of this country, the workers, the youth, even those who voted for them in 2019, that they are a real alternative to the South-West.
We know, after all, that many of them are currently considering voting for the KKE. We therefore call on you to close your ears to blackmail and take the big step at the time of the ballot box.
We are waiting for you beside us, to walk together on the same road of honesty. To fight together the great battles that our people need.
A strong KKE, then, next Sunday. To express anger and indignation. To give the people a shield for today. To strengthen hope for tomorrow!
