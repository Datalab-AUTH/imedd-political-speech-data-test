There is one question that every working man, every young man and woman, every working man, every young man and woman, every working man and woman of the people here in Heraklion, in the whole of Crete, must answer within themselves in the one week that remains until the elections and with this criterion they must go to the ballot box next Sunday: What is the one result that can really make a difference for them, that will not be "one of the same" as the previous times? What result will enable them to be re-energized? To feel that something is changing? What is it that is ultimately decided in this election for the people?
We, with the sincerity and honesty that you know characterises us - regardless of whether you agree with us more or less - say this:

The only real good that can come out of these elections for our people is that the KKE is much stronger! Only then will you yourselves be stronger, to fight together, from better positions, against a policy that is demonstrably unpopular. To open another, better way for us and our children, for the radical changes we need.
Pay no attention to the familiar blackmail and dilemmas that everyone else is putting up to once again steal the popular vote. Do not make their anxiety about 'stability' your own. Their stability is instability for the people's interests.
On the contrary, the weaker, the more unstable the parties of capital, ND, SYRIZA and PASOK and their "complements", the better for all of us.

Because these parties, right after the elections, whatever the composition of the government, will take over the baton of the Recovery Fund to pass the next 350 preconditions at the expense of the workers. In fact, they are not even holding out until the election. On Wednesday, while their leaders were struggling to show how much they differ in the debate, the MEPs of ND, SYRIZA and PASOK were voting in favour of the new levies on the people provided for in the EU budget, so that the 'gluttony' of the conglomerates could continue.

After the elections, the goal of "fiscal stability" that they all share, the bloody surpluses that are coming back, mean new sacrifices, new taxes, new income squeezes.
After the elections, all of us will continue to live the consequences of the "liberalized" energy market, of the onslaught of capitalist profit in every sector and in every aspect of our lives, as we experienced them tragically with the crime of Tempe, which must not be forgotten.

After the elections, the banks, the crows of the funds, the various Patsis and all the others to whom ND, SYRIZA and PASOK have handed over the red loans of the people for a plate of lentils will continue to auction off houses and to squeeze people's families.

Watch out! Don't be misled! None of them say they will stop this! They all take it for granted, because, as Mr. Tsipras said, auctions take place in every favored state!

After the elections, they will send the representative of the next government to the upcoming NATO meeting, which is expected to give a "signal" for further involvement in the imperialist war raging in Ukraine. The same government will continue the dangerous bargaining in Greek-Turkish relations for settlements that add fuel to the fire of antagonisms.
We invite you to ask yourselves: why are we hearing absolutely nothing about this very serious issue in the election period? When everyone is arguing about everyone on the most trivial of occasions?
Why is it that only the KKE insists on raising it?
The reason is simple: we hear nothing because they have nothing to argue about! Because they agree! That is why the US Ambassador says that he is not very concerned about what the next government will be. Since with whatever government emerges, he will do his dirty work...

Crete, which all Greek governments have turned into the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the USA, as they themselves say, and at the same time have turned it into a target of their opponents, is a very characteristic example of what it means for each government to continue where the previous one left off and to take it even further...
We are of course talking about the dangerous Greek-American agreement on bases, prepared by the SYRIZA government and ratified by the ND government. Recently "Rizospastis" published their detailed plans for upgrading and expanding the Souda base, which is planned, in fact, modelled on the NATO "headquarters" for the war in Ukraine, the US base in Ramstein, Germany. The bigger the base, the greater the dangers and insecurity for our people!
And we believe that there is not a single sane person left who believes that there is any chance of our allies moving from their bases to assist in the event of a hot incident with Turkey. No matter how many phone calls any prime minister or Mr Varoufakis makes to them, as he told us he would...
As if there weren't enough phone calls when Cyprus was invaded or in 1996 with Imia... All they will say is "find them", as they have been doing all these years as the aggression of the Turkish bourgeoisie escalates in its confrontation with the Greek ruling class. Because what they are primarily interested in is to keep Turkey in the arms of NATO and away from the arms of Russia, for their own interests.

One is the great goal of the parties of the system, which are claiming to govern the country in these elections: growth. And because this system is called capitalism, it is about capitalist development. It is around this that they are crossing swords over who is best able to secure it.  Behind this goal, they also call upon the people to fall in line.
But think about it, didn't we have growth in 2022? What did the people gain from that?
They saw their disposable income, the real wage fall by 7.4% according to official figures. For others, of course, the results of growth were very different: More than 10 billion euros in net profits were made by only 150 companies listed on the stock exchange, recording a 10% increase.

We wouldn't say they did too badly. Wouldn't they?
The workers feel this very well "under their own skin" here in Crete. The thousands of hotel and tourism workers who have been working for a month now and have started the tourist season and do not know if and how they will finish it. Because it is still May and the organisations of the KKE, the unions do not have time to register the complaints about working from sun to sun, 7 days without days off, in miserable conditions.

On the other hand, of course, from very early on hoteliers, tourism entrepreneurs and tour operators are openly talking about a record year in arrivals, revenues and obviously new surpluses, since they had previously received the generous subsidies and tax exemptions for renovations and new investments in green beds from the recovery fund and the state budget. While seasonal workers - who are "rich" according to the governments - received only three months of the slashed unemployment fund and "too much for them", they replied!  Further proof that only moneyed investors, not hard-working workers, can fit within the fiscal constraints and the economy's strengths. This is the common programme of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK. This is the miracle of tourism development for which they all boast and serve together.

After they have all together created the whole anti-labour arsenal that ensures the squeezing of hotel employees and the annihilation of self-employed workers, now the Southwest is advertising that it will send the "rambos" of the control mechanisms to be the traffic police of its implementation!.
What should we be reminded of:
- The PASOK government in 2011 abolished the heavy and unhealthy for industry specialties cooks, maids.
- The ND-PASOK coalition government in 2012 abolished in substance the sectoral agreements and the National General Collective Labour Agreement and established that the basic wage should be set by ministerial decision.
- The SYRIZA-ANEL government abolished the one-off pension for hotel employees at 20 years of age with the Katrougalos law and fixed the retirement age at 67. It legislated the restriction of the right to strike.
- The last government of the New Democracy with the Hatzidakis law regulating working hours, among other things, put a headstone on the 8-hour and 5-day working week, which had no practical application in hotels anyway. A law that was also voted for by 50% of SYRIZA.

No government has abolished the anti-worker - anti-insurance laws of the previous one, instead it stepped on them and strengthened them. Both the so-called "progressive-left" government - muff, and the neoliberal right-wing government", supported the business groups, bundled them with profits, and created even worse working conditions. They gave hot money to the big businessmen. In 2021 alone, more than 800 million euros were given as direct state subsidies to tourism businesses, to reduce the loss from reduced traffic due to coronavirus.

Nor do the thousands of seasonal workers know how they will be able to vote next Sunday, since the leave sounds like a joke, while the government rejected the KKE amendment to allow them to vote in the place where they work.

Such is democracy in this system... It stops outside the gates of workplaces. But we urge them not to do them any favors. Demand the permission they are entitled to and go vote for the JPC to punish those who want to take away their voice.
Do all the people of Crete finally get their due from this development? Do the tens of thousands of workers in hotels, restaurants and the countless tourist businesses benefit? And if they are, why are they not queuing outside the big businesses looking for work? Why are the big hotel owners here in Crete and all over the country, once again, complaining about tens of thousands of job vacancies?
What prevents - if not the greed and ruthlessness of employers, the goal of speculation - a tourism worker from working 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours, with humane working conditions and wages that meet his needs? Why is it reasonable to work 6 months and have to live 12? Why couldn't tourism and recreation work all year round?
Precisely because, the monopolies want to suck up when and as long as there is incoming increased tourist traffic.
Think how many, how and how much would work if people had access to good, quality holidays all year round! What really prevents a small business from growing and ensuring a good life for a self-employed person working with their family, if not the relentless competition with the industry behemoths?

But the hundreds of earthquake and flood victims of the municipalities of Minoa, Archanes Asterousia, Hersonissos and Malevizi feel the benefits of capitalist development in their own skin. 17 months and counting since the earthquakes in Arkalochori, 6 months since the deadly floods in Agia Pelagia.
It is not only that these people have not yet got back on their feet, but they have been completely abandoned by the government and the local administration. It is that even today no substantial planning for flood and seismic protection of these much-affected areas has been initiated.

In addition, residents are also experiencing the drama of auctions! And it is well known that the funds do not discriminate and no protection has been provided for those affected. And they continue to pay ENVIA, they continue to pay their taxes and at the same time they are freezing their bank accounts, even though they had put some money into them, just to keep them tied up.

And all this, when a little further away in the much-affected Castelli, the funding of the big developers and owners of the new airport is flowing abundantly and expanding, as is the destruction of the area.
The pattern is obvious. Selling off "bir para" people's property and converting the area, from an agricultural production area to a real estate business. Only the KKE has honestly stood by their side, in their struggles and their demands for immediate, 100% compensation for their damages and substantial help to rebuild their homes and businesses, or do the island's health workers and all the residents - don't they feel the unpopular policy in their own skin?

The deterioration of the public health care system and the commercialisation of its services, the closed operating rooms and the long wait for an appointment, the huge shortages of staff, the drastic reduction of state spending and the increase in direct and indirect payments by the people for health care are the results of the policies of all governments, which were most tragically demonstrated during the three years of the pandemic.
The culmination of this situation is the bill on secondary care passed by the ND government, which speaks of mergers of hospitals within a short distance, "photographing" Venizelio and the hospitals of the prefecture of Lasithi. This is the reason why the hospital is systematically and consciously being downgraded.

We communists have been the first in the battle for the past four years to change all this, to achieve the slightest relief, putting into practice the slogan "only the people save the people". We fought for wage increases, for the signing of Collective Labour Agreements that would put a stop to the physical extermination of workers. For health and safety measures to prevent workers from being crippled, for measures to rehabilitate those affected by natural disasters, for strengthening public hospitals, health centres everywhere, for upgrading the education provided to our children and much more.

We believe that we have offered as much as we could to our people, to the extent of the powers that they have given us. The one and only KKE MP in the whole of Crete, Manolis Syntycheakis, brought all these issues to Parliament, along with many others that concern the people of the region.
Therefore, we invite you to consider whether you have something to gain or lose from the re-election of a KKE MP in Heraklion, from the election of other communist MPs on your island. Crete will only gain!
The position we hold today, our whole action for the people, that we will not become a crutch for any unpopular government is precisely because we have a scientifically elaborated program, a program of another, workers' - people's government - power. We have a programme for a truly pro-people development, free from the profit criterion that creates all these evils.

We are ready, when the working class, the Greek people choose to do so, to assume our responsibility in a popular governance, where the protagonists will be the producers of wealth themselves and not the drones who suck it away. In such a real power of the workers, where the people will not be a spectator, simply by voting once every four years, where democracy will not stop outside the gates of the factories or at the entrances of department stores and hotels, but every production unit will be a beehive, not only of labour creation, but also of democracy, debate and militant voluntary initiative! In such a governance - power, where the KKE will participate, the elected representatives of the people will be truly accountable to those who elected them.

There will be the possibility of control and recall, every crucial bill or decision will be discussed down to the bottom, among all the people, in the workplaces, in the workers' popular assemblies. In this workers' - people's power, the deepest and broadest concept of freedom and democracy will take shape, all discrimination, all coercion and, above all, the exploitation of man by man will be abolished. The only 'compulsion' will be the prohibition of exploitation.

In this power, the unprecedented potential in production will be unleashed, the advantages of our land, the rich soils, the exceptional climatic conditions, the significant mineral wealth, the potential for real green energy from all domestic energy sources will be exploited.
The rich experience of workers, scientific achievements, the whole economy, every resource, every infrastructure, every productive activity will be harnessed, all will converge through the central plan into one basic law: That is, the satisfaction of modern social needs and not profit.

Such governance will break the shackles of international unequal relations and agreements. It will free the country from the EU and NATO, and will carry out bilateral agreements on an equal basis with other countries.
Today there is a solution to build a very safe and modern transport network. There is a solution to not being food-dependent - and not only - on this rich and blessed land. There is a solution for dealing with flooding, strong earthquakes, using scientific achievements, with integrated planning.

Today the conditions have been scientifically formed for the existence of a system of Primary Health Care and hospitals fully staffed with all specialties and all modern means.
There is a solution so that tourism, recreation and relaxation are a guaranteed right of the working class and the grassroots, not an expensive commodity. To enjoy the beauties of the whole country with modern infrastructure, which they are now unable to do in large numbers, mainly for economic reasons.

Tourism should become a right and a bridge of real friendship, acquaintance and cooperation between peoples. That is why we are on the road to confrontation with the real opponent, the one that all the other parties hide because they serve it, the inhuman system of exploitation.

There are only a few days left until the opening of the ballot box on May 21 and there are days when a lot more can be done by the members and friends of the KKE, in order to take the Party as high as possible. With the ballot papers for each constituency in hand in the days that remain until the last minute, we are organizing an even wider opening to the people and the youth.
Home to home in the districts, post to post in the places of work and study, man to man everywhere, to carry the Party's call for an even stronger JCP, so that the people themselves will be strong on the next election day.

Now, therefore, it is time for the discussion to go to the "for the time being": in these elections, KKE! To bankrupt to the last moment every false dilemma, every obstacle that the other parties put up to the criterion of the working class, trying to put it in the search for a "saviour".

The people of Crete know well, they can understand that neither will they see "progress" from ND, nor will they see "change" with SYRIZA, nor will their eager tails, PASOK and MERA25, keep their "bosikas".
Never mind that now it seems that the "dividing lines" have now fallen for good. Transfers in the ballot papers of the prefectures of Crete between ND, SYRIZA, PASOK and MERA25 are also on the increase. That's how big - you see - the distances between the bourgeois parties are.

On the contrary, the people of Crete know that they have much to gain from a strong KKE in Crete and throughout Greece. With more elected deputies who will have them firmly on their side, present everywhere, in the difficulties they face and in their demands.
Until the last minute we make the night a day! For those who have been in power for the last 4 years and have crushed the people with their policies to get an answer. And they can only get an answer by voting for the original opponent of their policies, the KKE.

As they got a response in the student elections, where the party of the KNE, the Panspoudastiki, emerged for the second consecutive year as the leading force, leaving 10 percentage points behind the government's GOP and the SYRIZA party competing with the whites...
Those who supported the ND government with their attitude throughout these four years, voting for half of its bills and backing down at all critical moments, after they too had crushed the people as a government, should get an answer. And now they have the nerve to "scratch the goat's goo", like Mr Tsipras, who is trying, supposedly, to blackmail the KKE to give it support to sit on the neck of the people again and continue the work of Mitsotakis.

He knows very well that there is no such thing. If we did not step on the "banana peel" in 2012 and 2015, when he was not yet in power and was selling hopes by the pound as if they were oranges, is there any chance of doing him a favour now that he cannot even convince those who believed him in the past?
Of course they don't believe that. The blackmail they are directing is not at the JCP in general. It is, in fact, blackmail to the people, to the voters, blackmail to all those who have taken notice of them and are thinking of abandoning them. And there are more than a few...

It shows, above all, the great difficulty they have in convincing the progressive people of this country, the workers, the youth, even those who voted for them in 2019, that they are a real alternative to the South-West.
We know, after all, that many of them are currently considering voting for the KKE. We therefore call on you to close your ears to blackmail and take the big step at the time of the ballot box.
We are waiting for you beside us, to walk together on the same road of honesty. To fight together the great battles that our people need.
A strong KKE, then, next Sunday. To express anger and indignation. To give the people a shield for today. To strengthen hope for tomorrow!
