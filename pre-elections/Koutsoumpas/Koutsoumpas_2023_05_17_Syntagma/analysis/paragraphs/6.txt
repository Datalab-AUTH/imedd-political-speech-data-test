After all, during these 4 years, many times we were all together in the streets of struggle and they were alone in the chairs of power.How else were collective agreements signed with wage increases in a number of areas?How else were anti-employer plans of the employers cancelled by the workers of COSCO, E-food, LARCO? How a spark created whole pockets of resistance in important workplaces and sectors, which became a reference point for the whole working class?With a hard class, unyielding struggle and a clear understanding that for the workers to win, capital must lose. How were people's houses saved, and auctions and evictions cancelled? Was it by choosing between plans that have at their core the stability of the banking system and the profitability of the funds, the crows? NO! They were saved when the people turned to their unions, to the neighbourhood, to the communist deputies and, together, kicked out the crows.How did unjust laws and provisions, such as the law on the restriction of demonstrations by Chrysochoidis or most of the provisions of the Hatzidakis law, remain on paper? How did the students manage to withdraw the thoughts of police entry into universities? Was it by voting in favour of 50% of the ND laws, as SYRIZA did, or 70%, as PASOK did? Or maybe by waiting for "conditions to mature" and another "muff" supposedly progressive government to come along and abolish these laws, as it did, supposedly, with the memoranda?
