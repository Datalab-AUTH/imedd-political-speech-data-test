They alone and all of us! They alone should be in a hurry to legislate the more than 300 unpopular preconditions of the Recovery Fund that are in their drawers, in order to finance directly the needs of the business groups and not, of course, the needs of the people and the youth. Running to catch the numbers and targets for the "investment grade" on top of the crushed rights of workers and their squeezing. To put various cosmetic adjectives, even colours, in front of the notorious "development" to cover up the fact that capitalist development is black and crude, because it stems from exploitation and increases the deadlocks in the lives of the people.They alone can compete with each other to see who and how to implement more effectively the commitments to the US and NATO butchers, commitments that the people will pay for, both literally and metaphorically.
