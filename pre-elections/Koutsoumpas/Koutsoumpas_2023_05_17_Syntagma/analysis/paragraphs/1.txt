Friends, compañeras and compañeros, tonight we can now say it with certainty: On Sunday the KKE can become even stronger! This is how it must be and this is how it will be. We will see to it, giving our best in the coming days and hours until the polls close.  So on Sunday, the KKE can become even stronger! Yesterday Patras said so, the day before yesterday Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Lamia. Athens is shouting it today, with this huge, shocking, red-hot gathering of people and youth here in Syntagma, in the heart of Athens, in the heart of Greece: KKE strong so that the people can be strong.Yes, so that the people can be strong, that's what more and more workers, working class people, people of the working class, schoolchildren, students who are approaching our party for the first time are choosing. Because they see, they feel that if hope remains alive and bright, it is because the KKE has kept it alive and continues to keep it alive, with its attitude, with its action and above all with its political proposal that gives a way out and a perspective to the people!
