Let ND, SYRIZA, PASOK and others share the roles of winners and losers among themselves. You, however, will be the winners, because strengthening the KKE is a gain for the people and their struggles.You know that! The vote for the KKE stays with the KKE, it is not changed, it is not redeemed, it is not bargained. Every vote in the KKE will be deposited in every workplace the next day, to increase the wage, to prevent any dismissal, to sign a collective agreement. Every vote for the KKE adds a link to the human chain of struggle for the survival of the self-employed professional, the self-employed farmer. It increases the human chain of solidarity, so that the people's family does not lose its home, so that its children have all the necessary things, their education, their health care, their sports, their culture. Every vote for the KKE will remain on the ramparts of the struggle, of the defence of the dikis, who "will not settle for less sky".
