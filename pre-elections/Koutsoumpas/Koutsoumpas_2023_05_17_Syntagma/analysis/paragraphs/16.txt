So let us come together on the road of honesty, consistency, the struggle for a better tomorrow for the many. Leave alone those who invite you to settle for less and less, for a life that does not correspond to the possibilities of our times. They are alone and we are all alone! Because only the people can save the people, with the KKE in front!We all walk together, because we all have a class bias. We are not divided by the colour, religion, gender, origin, sexuality and orientation of each and every one of us, by what we voted yesterday and the day before yesterday.  We are all of us totally opposed to any kind of racism, fascism, violence and repression, capitalist barbarism.Friends, you are contributing to the increase of the KKE's percentage in all of Greece! To elect many more militant KKE deputies! To increase the KKE's percentage everywhere, and in the 9 single-member constituencies of the country! Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this is a wasted vote. Every vote for the KKE adds up to its nationwide percentage and sends more communist, militant MPs to parliament, nationwide. Lost is every vote to the ruling parties of ND, SYRIZA, PASOK and their various complements, such as MERA 25 and El. We can and we will succeed! To revive hope again, with a strong KKE!Goodbye good strength to all!
