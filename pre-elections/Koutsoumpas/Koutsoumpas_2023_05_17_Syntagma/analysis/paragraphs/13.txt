This is the programme that we openly present to the people and we are ready to serve it, when the people choose it, when they decide to actively come forward to follow this path, and to be truly in power themselves. The KKE has a scientifically elaborated Program for the social ownership of all those means that produce wealth in our country, the factories, big business, the ports, the airports, the railways. To operate, no longer for the profit of each "investor" - robber, but to meet social needs. It has a programme to exploit the central scientific planning of the economy, in order to make the most of the productive potential, the labour and scientific potential of the country, to eliminate unemployment. This power, and the economy, will be based on the active role of the workers, who, through their place of work, through their assemblies, will decide on everything, will elect their representatives, up to the highest, national level, whom they will be able to recall at any time when they are not doing their job well. For this, then, for the great and beautiful, the great and exciting, socialism, the KKE can today assume great responsibilities. This is what those who felt left-wing, progressive, democrats have always done. They took great responsibilities by making great sacrifices in the movement, in the struggles. That is what we are doing today.
