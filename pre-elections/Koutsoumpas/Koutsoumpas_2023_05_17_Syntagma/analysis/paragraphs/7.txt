No. The struggling people did it without expecting anything from above. It did it by looking where the struggle is organized, in the unions, in the associations, in the struggle committees. It did it by fighting daily against this barbaric policy and the repression that accompanies it. By disobedience and indiscipline against unjust laws. By putting forward his right. And by putting into practice "only the people save the people".This is how our lives are improved directly. And all these examples have one thing in common: that the communists gave their best, were the mind, heart and organizer of these struggles. With a stronger Communist Party, these struggles can become even stronger, more effective. There on the front line in every workplace, in every neighbourhood, everywhere where a battle of our people is being fought, will be the KKE deputies.
