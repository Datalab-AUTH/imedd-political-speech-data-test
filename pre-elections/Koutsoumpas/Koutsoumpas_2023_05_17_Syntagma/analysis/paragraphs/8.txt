Ladies and friends Compañeras and compañeros At the ballot boxes on Sunday, we want to meet again with those who were with us in the popular struggles of the past four years. We want to be with those who voted for the forces of the KKE wherever and whenever ballot boxes were set up during these four years: The hundreds of thousands of public and private sector workers who made us a second force in the GSEE and ADEDY. The workers of Athens who made us the first force in the largest labour centre of the country and in other labour centres that changed hands after years, that massed workers' unions, formed struggle committees. To meet again with the pensioners who never gave up the struggle for a decent life, with the parents, teachers and students, who met in the mobilizations for the obvious in a school that exterminates instead of educating our children. With the artists who fought through their unions for their labour rights, for an artistic education up to the level of modern needs. Because the KKE is the force that has put its stamp on culture, with struggles, ideas and actions.
