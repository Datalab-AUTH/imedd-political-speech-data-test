That's why Mr Tsipras is screaming that we are putting him in the same bag as Mitsotakis. But he put himself in the bag when he voted for the 3rd brutal memorandum, making use of the tolerance offered to him by ND and PASOK at the time... And then, as the opposition, he stood back and voted for the 200 unpopular bills of ND. This is what former voters of SYRIZA see today, abandoning him and looking to the KKE. No further proof is needed. The needle has been stuck in the 1950s for the last few weeks. To the "what Plastiras, what Papagos" that Tsipras monotonously repeats to attack the KKE. I guess, Mr. Tsipras, in keeping with historical proportions, claims to be the successor of Plastira; but we are the successors of Nikos Belogiannis, who was sent to the firing squad by Plastira, the Americans and the Palace.
