Friends and friends, comrades, that is why we fight and sing! We are carrying out a huge task, a great intervention of the Party in the field of culture. Because a strong people means having strong resistance to the rotten values that this rotten system generates and maintains. It has been amply confirmed in this period that only the KKE and the KNE can make the breakthrough against subculture and the attempt to embellish this barbarism that the system attempts through art. We can and do give impetus, inspiration and a platform to new artistic creation. Because the KKE is the Party that goes beyond, as Stavros Xarchakos said, for the good of the people, of the youth, to raise the boot of our people higher.Such great responsibilities are assumed by the KKE, holding high the same flag of struggle, of selflessness, of collectivity, of real progress. The same flag was raised by thousands of leftists, progressives in the past years. We are addressing all of you who still cry when you hear our beloved Thanos Mikroutsikos say, from the podium of his last concert at the 2019 KNE Festival, that: "Things are law, they change. The point is to change them in the right direction. I can only promise you a little bit: Until the end, I will be here!".We are addressing all of you, who shudder when reading the political will of our great Miki Theodorakis. Because many of you felt that he was also speaking for you, when he wrote that the details fade from his mind and the "big things" remain! These big things unite us in the streets of the struggle. They can also unite us on Sunday at the ballot box.
