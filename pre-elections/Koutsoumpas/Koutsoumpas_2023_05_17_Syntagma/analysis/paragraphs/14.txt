We take the responsibility to go against the pressures of this whole rotten system, its blackmail, to keep the people tied down and manipulated. The organization of the struggle, the counter-attack of the workers, of the popular movement. We assume the responsibility to fight against the transformation of our country into a vast US-NATO base, its participation in the imperialists' massacre in Ukraine. Because in this country, the imperialists know that they will always be unwelcome, they know that their plans will be hindered and delayed, no matter how good relations they have built up with the parties of the system.We take responsibility and take important initiatives to build solid relations with other peoples, we express our solidarity with the struggling peoples, with the Communist Parties struggling throughout Europe, from all corners of the world. We know that the strengthening of the KKE will give strength to the workers who are on strike in France, to the German workers who are demanding collective agreements with increases and are opposed to Mr Tsipras' friend, the so-called "progressive" government of Scholz.
