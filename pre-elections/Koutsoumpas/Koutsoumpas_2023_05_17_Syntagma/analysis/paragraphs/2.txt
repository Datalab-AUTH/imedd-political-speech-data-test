Let the people be strong, say the messages of optimism coming from workplaces, neighbourhoods, schools and colleges. Because more and more people now know that a new anti-people's government is about to be formed. They may delay it a little, but it will be built by parties that share the goals of capital that is why they have a common government program. This is now a done deal. They will form a government as they did in the past, when PASOK went with ND and all together first with LAOS and then with DIMAR, when SYRIZA went with the far-right ANEL and together with ND and PASOK they loaded us with a third barbaric memorandum. They will do their job, they will form a government. And we will do ours! We will strengthen the stable, confident, militant opposition, the KKE!
