Now, in fact, ND and SYRIZA have found a new trope. The special purpose government. SYRIZA to fish in murky waters that a government can be formed on 4 and 5 issues, while the governments are all general and not special purpose. And the South-Western party is taking the pass to promote its own blackmail about instability and ungovernability. But we answer them: They have not been slaughtered and we are not going to fall for their nonsense! They are all on to them now! Yes, friends! In the end, nothing has changed in the strategy of the parties contesting the seat of government, but nothing is the same as it used to be. Because along with a crime, the crime in Tempe, we have also witnessed in our country and great mobilisations all over Greece. Hundreds of thousands of people and youth flooded the streets and squares all over the country... The people's rage, which in the ballot box can only be expressed in one way. Because we promised it, we are doing it and we will continue to do it: this crime, for which all the governments of the last 15 years are responsible, as it has been proven, we will not let it be forgotten. Now that almost no one else wants to talk about it anymore, we insist that the motto of these demonstrations be answered: 'Their profits or our lives'! The New Democracy, Syriza, PASOK and the rest answer. We, the KKE, answer firmly, militantly, decisively: Our lives! And we give this answer every day with our attitude, with our action and with our Program. Because only the Programme of the KKE reads in big letters: satisfaction of modern needs! This is the Programme of the KKE, a programme of people's power - governance that takes us out of the present "vicious circle", out of the recurrent deadlocks of this system.
