Lately, we have been watching another repulsive confrontation... Between the two parties of social democracy, SYRIZA and PASOK, over the legacy of Andreas Papandreou! Tsipras and Androulakis have taken the slogan of "Change" and are carrying it around from rally to rally. As you can understand, it is not our business, nor do we have any anxiety to make a conclusion, about who is the legal heir, who has the high ownership and who has the usufruct. But we want to appeal to the Greek people with their democratic, progressive and militant traditions.They are playing with your feelings! They are playing with your memory! They want to make you look to the distant past to steal your vote and then turn it against you. Many may look back on the past with nostalgia, but the reality, whether we like it or not, is that there is no going back to the past. 2023 is not 1981. This system, which was served for years by PASOK, and more recently by SYRIZA from government positions, has now become so rotten, so reactionary, that it can no longer concede anything to the people, unless they impose it themselves through their struggle.
