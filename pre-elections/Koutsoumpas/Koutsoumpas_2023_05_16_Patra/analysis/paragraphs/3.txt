Fortunately in this country there is a positive option, the working class. Our people have conquered this with their own blood. There is the red, the militant, the red ballot paper of the Communist Party of Greece. So we say with heart and mind, let's go for the Communist Party of Greece. To breathe, to cheer up, to smile. But to terrorize the terrorists of our lives. To be stronger the next day so that we can fight them more effectively, To improve our lives, to make more visible the way out for the people proposed by the C.C.E. That is, the real power of the people. We can say this today with even greater confidence than we did in January when we were back here in Patras. In these elections, the C.C.U. can become much stronger. Sunday's election result. It may not be one of the same. This is the message coming from all over Greece. We see it too when we talk to workers, to working people who approach us for the first time and are thinking of voting for the Communist Party. But the other staffs of the system, the various parties, see it too, and when they read that there are many people who, if you ask them if they are thinking of voting for the Communist Party, say yes. I'm thinking about it. Today, a few days before the polls. For those still thinking about it, we say go for it. Let's all take a big step forward together and that step to be solid to be strong is only C.C.E. They too see how that step can be taken, as it was in the student ballot and for the second time in a row. And here in Patras, the All Student First Force was heard. Others had their smiles cut off for once. They may be cut off a second time on Sunday with a very high percentage of the K.C.E. They see it, they admit it.
