Comrades, friends, friends. Workers and youth are not interested in other people's shady remarks about the past. They are interested in one thing: how to secure a better present and future. And the programmes of New Democracy, Syriza, PASOK do not ensure this. They have no meaningful answer to give to their anxieties. So because the programmes of all the others are common in their basic points alone, the programme of Mr C.E. is at the opposite end of the spectrum.
