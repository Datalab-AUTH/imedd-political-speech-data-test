 That's why various big employers even call workers to apologize because they went and listened to a candidate of Mr. C.E. who visited their workplace. That is why some other graphical people who have been disqualified by life itself are filing petitions in the Supreme Court to allegedly disqualify the K.C.E. from the elections. That is why the candidates of the New Democracy, who a short time ago were saying that it was the fault of the unemployed for not knowing how to write a good CV, are now going back to the channels and saying that the C.C.E. wants to abolish democracy. That's why the president of SYRIZA is also scratching himself on the shepherd's goat and dealing with the CC in every speech he makes, because it seems he has got the message that thousands of progressive left-wing people are fed up with his mockery, fed up with seeing him vote for memoranda and the next day for the two hundred unpopular bills of Mitsotakis in this Parliament and now they are turning their backs on him. They are turning their gaze to the KKE.
