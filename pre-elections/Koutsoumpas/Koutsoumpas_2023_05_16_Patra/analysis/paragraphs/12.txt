There is no change in the prison of the European Union of NATO for a handful of parasites who are in charge of the wealth of our own country. There never has been just today. It is much more obvious now. Real change, political change means ending the robber capitalist state. And political change is not to leave one and bring in the other staying the same but their political political change is to confront the capitalist economy, to socialize the means of producing wealth in this country, to break free from the shackles of the European Union and NATO, to design our society, our economy, to meet our own needs. And this real radical political change has a name, it is socialism.
