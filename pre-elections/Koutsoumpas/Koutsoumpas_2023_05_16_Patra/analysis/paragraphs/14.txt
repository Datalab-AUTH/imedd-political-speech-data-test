That is why only the communists can still today use whatever position the people trust them with to oppose and fight this barbaric system. This common policy of these anti-people's governments, so that our people can stand upright, have conquests, have their lives improved as much as possible. This is what the C.C.E. is doing in Parliament. This is what it is doing in the municipalities, in the regions. This is what the Municipal Authority of Mr. K.E. has been doing for 9 years in the Municipality of Patras with the militant Kostas Peletidis as mayor. And look what happened now. They put aside the quarrels of those who argue who will goat on the neck of the people again. The leaders of New Democracy, Syriza, PASOK and they are chatting, he says they will get rid of the militant mayor of Patras, Kostas Peletidis. They sleep standing up, we tell them, they say, and they pay a free hotelier. If they think so. Because the municipal authority of Patras and its mayor have become a benchmark now throughout Greece. Do you remember what our Olympic champion Miltos Tendoglou said a few days ago that we are coming to transfer him to Athens, so that the athletes can train like people here in Patras. But don't worry we won't take Mr. K. E. He has many worthy fighters in every city, in every municipality throughout the country. Kostas Peletidis will stay here, he will be re-elected mayor of Patras and those who make other plans will eat their faces. So that is why we are saying that the people of Patras also have another reason to punish them in Sunday's parliamentary elections. Reinforcing Mr. C.E.
