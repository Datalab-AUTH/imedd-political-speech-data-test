Friends, compañeras and compañeros, recently we have witnessed a well-known debate between the parties of the system on whether or not their programmes are costed. Have you heard? Aren't they really fed up with the same debate every election period? Anyway, people are tired of them and don't pay much attention. But it makes sense that they are arguing about that and not about the substance, about the focus of their programmes, since it is the same. Why are these programmes written with the pens of the business groups, the Association of Greek Industrialists, the Bank of Greece, the Commission, NATO? Because their central ideas are fiscal stability for the return of the bloody surpluses, the stability of the banks, also the creation of an attractive investment environment. But what does that mean in terms of smashed labour rights? Because the first pages of these programmes contain the 350 unpopular preconditions that any next government will legislate in order to disburse the Recovery Fund instalments and put a pin in the pockets of the big business groups. When New Democracy and Syriza are arguing about whether their programmes are costed, one thing the working man, the man of labour, understands is that his own needs have already been costed and thrown out of their programmes. Because there are only the profits of a few conglomerates.
