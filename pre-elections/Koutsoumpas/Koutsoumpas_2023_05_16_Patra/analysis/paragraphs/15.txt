Friends, today is not 2012 or 2015. We have known them all as a government. We have seen time and time again the big talk go by the wayside. The promises thrown away, the trade of hope giving way to disappointment. But we are not even in 2019. And that's what's different. In the last four years we have fought great battles against the policies implemented by the Mitsotakis government, continuing of course in the same direction as the previous SYRIZA government with the extreme right-wing ANEL. In these years we have fought battles inside the academy, we have broken unacceptable bans, we have taken to the streets to strengthen the public health system, for protection measures at workplaces, in transport, in schools, in universities. We did not wait for accountability afterwards, nor did we propose ministers of common approval with Mitsotakis, as SYRIZA did. After all, what do we have in common with them, since we are two different worlds?
