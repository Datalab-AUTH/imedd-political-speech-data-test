Here in Patras you know it very well. I don't have to tell you that you and the CP have achieved all this. Everything but everything with the People's Coalition. As a municipal authority you cut the chewing gum on the various masulas and improved your city, i.e. its everyday life. Poor people here in Patras, by also throwing the employers' lackeys out of the unions and fighting together with the communist trade unionists, you changed the situation. You made the Labour Centre labour again. With the KNE strong in the schools of Patras, the streets and squares of the city were flooded so that this predestined crime in Tempe would not be forgotten. With the Panspoudastiki, first force again in the University of Patras and in all of Greece. The students took the associations in their hands, demolished the government's faction that does not want to admit defeat and is constantly ridiculed.
