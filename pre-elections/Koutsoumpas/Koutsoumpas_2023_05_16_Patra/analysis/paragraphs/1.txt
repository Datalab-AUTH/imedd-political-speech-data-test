Friends, compañeras and compañeros, we are here tonight in Patras, the capital of Western Greece. In the final straight now to carry the optimistic, the militant, the subversive message of the Communist Party of Greece. One choice is there. KKE bite. There is hope. Not everything is black and pessimistic. There is not only the choice of the lesser evil which always unfortunately leads to the greater evil. The people of Achaia, the people of Western Greece do not have to go to the ballot box with half a heart, because nothing in their lives is going to change. He himself can help something to begin to change by his attitude, by his action and in solidarity with the C.C.E. In all battles and elections.
