Angry about what we have experienced in recent years, culminating recently in this crime in Tempe. Think of this great struggle to ensure that this crime is not forgotten, that there is no more of it. Who can carry it on and see it through to the end? Only Mr. C.E. Why only Mr. C.E. The question of their profits or our lives is firmly answered by our lives.
