So here it comes for all this and more the know how you know what you have to do so next Sunday to achieve much more together. All of you know that things. They are not stagnant. That each and every one's contribution to the collective effort multiplies our strength and can make a difference. You know that it is the vote in the C.C.E. that can rock the boat, that can bring about a Monday on May 22nd that is unlike the days before. So we appeal with an open heart to all those who are thinking in these last days of voting for the CEC, but who may still have doubts. To all those who have Mr. C.E. in their choices, but still haven't made up their minds. To all those heading to the ballot box.
