Because the programmes of the other parties are identical, we are witnessing another repulsive confrontation between the two parties of social democracy, SYRIZA and PASOK. Why are you talking about the legacy of Andreas Papandreou? Tsipras and Androulakis have taken the slogan of change and are carrying it around from rally to rally. As you understand, of course, it is not our business, nor do we have any anxiety to come to a conclusion about who is the rightful heir and who has the usufruct. But we want to address the people of Patras, of Achaia, a people with democratic, progressive, fighting traditions, and say to them: they are playing with your feelings, they are playing with your memory, they want to make you look only at the distant past in order to steal your vote today and then turn that vote against you. Many may look back on the past with nostalgia, but the reality whether we like it or not is that there is no going back to the past. 2023 is not 1981. This system that served for years and PASOK but. And recently from government positions, SYRIZA has now become so rotten, so corrupt, so reactionary that it can no longer concede anything to the people unless it imposes itself through its own struggle.
