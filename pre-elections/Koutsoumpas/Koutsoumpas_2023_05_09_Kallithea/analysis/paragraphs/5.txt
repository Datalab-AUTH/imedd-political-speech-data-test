Friends, compañeras and compañerosWhat has been written on the pages of history in blood cannot be erased with dirty ink. No matter how many millions the EU spends, no matter what the parties of the system do, in our country the unhistorical theory of two extremes, unfortunately for them, remains a minority.And even if some candidates of the New Democracy (ND) are humiliated in the panels, saying that "the KKE is an anti-democratic party and should not participate in the elections"! Let them go with them to have some coffee...And even if Mr. Tsipras in Sibiu, Romania, signing, together with Merkel, Orban, Kurz and other "fiddlers" of the far right, anti-communist declarations with references to the "iron curtain", the terminology used by the extraordinary military courts in our country to send communists, fighters, to the detachment.
