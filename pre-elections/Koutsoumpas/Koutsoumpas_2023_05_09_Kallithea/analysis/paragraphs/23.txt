Whatever we remember, one conclusion emerges: Whenever we smiled, whenever we shuddered, whenever we felt uplifted and optimistic, whenever we gained something during the four years of the anti-people's government of the South-West, the KKE had a hand in it.So, give us a hand, so that these moments will be much more in the years to come!Close your ears to those who bombard you from morning till night with scenarios and analyses of who will go with whom, with hardly anyone discussing the policies that the next government will implement. Ignore the boring fights, like the one between the social democratic parties SYRIZA and PASOK about who is the... heir of Andreas Papandreou! We are not nostalgic for yesterday, we are fighting, claiming and winning the life we deserve today, in the 21st century.
