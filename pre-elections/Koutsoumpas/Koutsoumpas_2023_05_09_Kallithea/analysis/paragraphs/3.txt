Here, of course, is also the illegal printing house of EAM and KKE. The machine, the legendary "Victoria", worked day and night manually - so that the informers and the battalion soldiers would not notice them - in the catacomb that stood two metres below the foundations of the house.Here is the castle of Bijaniou Street, where ten EPON henchmen, aged 17-25, held out for five hours against the battalion soldiers who outnumbered them. They managed to kill 50 and wound many more. They even gave up their lives to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy.This is how fascism is crushed! This is what history, both past and present, teaches us. Not by amendments, not by court decisions, not by general and vague "at the ballot box". Only with daily, unyielding struggle and in solidarity with those who are committed to fighting its womb, the rotten exploitative system.
