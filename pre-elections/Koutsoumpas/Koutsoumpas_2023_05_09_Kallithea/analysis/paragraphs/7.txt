We have understood, of course, that Tsipras is not doing very well with history anyway. Now he has remembered again, as he does every time we have elections, to dig up the slogan "what a Plastira, what a Papagos", in order to mock the KKE. We inform him and his ilk that this slogan is historically justified.If he wants to know why, let him visit the school "Belogiannis", here in Kallithea, where the prison from which 71 years ago the Plastira government and its friends, the "devilishly good" of Mr. Tsipras, the Americans, took Nikos Belogiannis and his comrades and led them to the firing squad.And let them stop saying that Plastira and some of his ministers tried but failed to save Belogiannis! Even so, it makes their responsibility for the heinous crime more serious...Let alone that with some far-right associations that Mr. Tsipras has lately and there in Menidi or even before that in Kastoria, it is up for discussion whether he feels more like a political descendant of Plastira or Papagos...So let him stop scratching on the goo of the shepherd...
