Because up to now, we ourselves, we the many, the working people, the self-employed, the young people and the young women have been paying dearly for the notorious capitalist development. EUR 10.4 billion was the net profit of only 150 business groups, those listed on the stock exchange, in 2022, an increase of 303% compared to the previous year. In the same period, real wages fell by 7.4%, as a result of the anti-labour laws that all of them have passed over the last 15 years and remain in force, combined with huge inflation.And they have the audacity to ask the people, Mr Mitsotakis "a chance to govern for the first time without national crises and difficulties", and Mr Tsipras "to govern for the first time without a memorandum"!
