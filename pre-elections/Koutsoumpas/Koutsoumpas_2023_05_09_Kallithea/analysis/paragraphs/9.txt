Friends, compañeras and compañeros, Few days left! Next Sunday, our people will measure their strength, the strength with which they will stand up to the next unpopular government.And we say to them today, here in Kallithea, that they can surprise and strengthen the KKE as much as possible!Yes, they can surprise! With a strong KKE he will find himself stronger, more prepared against the attack that will follow when the election lights go out. When the parties that have ruled and brought us to this point share the ministerial chairs and get back to their usual work.Then their entire government programme will come out of the drawers... Because so far we have only seen the cover page, let alone the titles of the contents.
