This is the support promised by the bourgeois parties. And in it, as you already know very well, the vast majority of professionals do not fit! Because it is support tailored to the principles of the competitiveness of the Greek capitalist economy and in the context of these principles, you are considered a handicap, a disadvantage, a structural problem!!!That is why thousands of professionals and small businesses have paid, along with the working class, the consequences of the crisis, but also the strategic choices that accompanied the capitalist development at every step: the launching of taxation with the memoranda and the bloody surpluses, the crushing of social security and pensions, the deadlocks of lockdown in the pandemic, energy precision and so much more.That's why today, and after already counting over 200,000 lockouts in the past decade, 47.3% of small and micro businesses have at least one overdue debt, and thousands are on the electronic auction lists!
