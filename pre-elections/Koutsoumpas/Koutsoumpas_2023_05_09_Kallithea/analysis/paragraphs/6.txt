And let some MPs of Mera25 in parliament tell us that socialism was "slightly fascist", that's why capitalism is the best system that has ever been tried!!!!Leftists, progressive people, all democrats in this country, know very well that anti-Sovietism, anti-communism, have nothing to do with progress, just as what Mr. Tsipras said a few days ago in Menidi about the Pontians in the Soviet Union has nothing to do with the truth. Is he ignoring the truth that, together with the Soviet people, the majority of Greeks of Pontian origin contributed to the building of socialism?Let us inform him that there, in the USSR, the Pontians, like all the people, received important resources to distinguish themselves and excel, while today, in their country of origin, they find devaluation, unemployment and insecurity.The Pontians, who came to Greece after the Asia Minor Catastrophe, settled in miserable conditions and survived in poverty and destitution. This was the care of the bourgeois state. But they also experienced the solidarity of the communists, with whom they struggled to survive and claim to live humanely. Then they joined en masse in the ranks of the EAM and the KKE, making a decisive contribution to the popular liberation struggle.
