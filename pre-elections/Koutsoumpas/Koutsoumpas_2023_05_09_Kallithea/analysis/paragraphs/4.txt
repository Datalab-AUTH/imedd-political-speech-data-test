It is important to remember that fascism is a child - or rather, a genesis - of this system. For we see today various people trying to present such forces as supposedly anti-systemic, while others tell us that Nazism is "flowing" to the angry. How anti-systemic is racism, anti-communism, strike-busting, the preying on the weak, the overt serving of interests? What of all this is the system itself, the governments, the EU, not doing? Do they think that we will forget the 140 questions in favour of the shipowners that Golden Dawn asked in the parliament in one year?So, now a very strong KKE so that all these people do not dare to come out of their burrows again!
