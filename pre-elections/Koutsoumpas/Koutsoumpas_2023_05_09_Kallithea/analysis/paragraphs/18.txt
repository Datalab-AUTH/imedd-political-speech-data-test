All these proposals, both ND and SYRIZA, either from the position of the government majority or from the position of the opposition, rejected them in the name of the "strength of the economy"! At the same time, of course, the tax exemptions for strategic investors and "distressed" shipowners, the reduction of taxes on dividends of major shareholders, give and take, both with ND and SYRIZA.That is why you must reject the false dilemmas that the parties of capital are addressing to you during the election campaign. The growth they preach, capitalist growth, is neither for everyone nor can it be fair. For you, the stability of big capital's profits is accompanied by intensification with no return, daily insecurity, debts and new and repeated deadlocks. This is the permanent situation for every small business, in a system where the big fish lives and reigns by eating the small fish.
