Friends, compañeras and compañeros. In the few days remaining until the elections, we invite you, those who have not yet decided, to do so with a warm heart. Put down all that you have and we have lived through in the last few years. What has made you feel anger, what has given you courage and courage: The struggles of our people, the health workers, the youth, in the midst of the pandemic to strengthen the public health system, to save lives in the face of a criminal management by the Southwest government. Who stood by the people? Those who exposed the government lies and the propaganda of the SW and the bourgeois staff, put their bodies forward and broke the bans and repression? Or those who had declared a "political moratorium" and proposed ministers of health of common consent, i.e. they were asking to be in coalition with Mitsotakis?
