No we answer! We don't give them a pass! We do not forget what the people have done to both of them! We know that the next day the unpopular laws that were passed both with and without memoranda will be here. The EU assessments and the difficulties of the system they serve will be here too! Again we will be told to be patient... And they will come after 4 years to ask us again, another "first chance" again...Mercy! Enough of this mockery! Our people are sick and tired of living the Groundhog Day! They want a better day to dawn at last! And this can only be achieved by the struggle of the people themselves and with a much stronger KKE!
