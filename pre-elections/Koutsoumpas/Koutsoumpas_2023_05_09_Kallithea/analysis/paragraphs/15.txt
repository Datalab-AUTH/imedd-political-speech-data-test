In these election days, the other parties, the New Democracy, SYRIZA, PASOK/KINAL, remember the freelancers. They shed crocodile tears for the "backbone of the economy", as they call you, and promise solutions.But even these vague pre-election promises have little value. And with this little phrase, which lumps together small and large businesses, businesses with a turnover of millions of euros and businesses that are living off the land without even securing their daily expenses, they reveal their true intentions. You know it as well as I do. The most dynamic businesses are the ones to which the programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced by the EU and all governments are directed, and not, of course, every professional who relies on his own work, a few family members or at most 1-2 employees. This is demonstrated by the recent programmes announced by the government on 'Digital Transformation', which require at least 5 workers to join them.  In other words, they concern less than 10% of the country's enterprises. SYRIZA is moving in the same direction, supporting the largest and most dynamic companies, since its own promises also presuppose conditions of "growth and extroversion"! Now what kind of "growth and extroversion" can be achieved by a small neighbourhood shop, a neighbourhood hairdresser's, a car repair shop, God forbid.
