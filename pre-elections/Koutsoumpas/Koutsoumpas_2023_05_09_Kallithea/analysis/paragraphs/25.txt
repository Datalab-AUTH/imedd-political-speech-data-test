And because we have heard a lot of things these days about the government that will emerge after the elections, we say to you that the best thing for the people is that a government of the weak and frightened will emerge... A government that will feel the hot breath of the working people's movement in every unpopular step it takes. And this can only be done with a strong KKE!We know that with a much stronger KKE on election Sunday, even people who may not have voted for us will smile, will feel won, even people who may not have voted for us. So take the step now! Make the surprise, so that the joy of all our people will be even greater!And you who have already decided, give your best in the remaining days! Do not count on fatigue, as thousands of members, cadres and friends of the KKE all over the country are not counting on it these days. Give what you can, so that our call reaches everywhere. Let the ballot paper of the KKE be placed in every people's house in Kallithea, Nea Smyrna, Brahamiya, Heliopolis, everywhere, in all the neighborhoods of the South Sector.Because only the people can save the people, with a much stronger KKE! With 2 elected communist deputies here in the South Sector! With many more all over the territory! To have more militant deputies in the Parliament, who will run, as the KKE deputy in the South, Christos Katsotis, did, from house to house where eviction is about to take place, in order to stop it, together with the people of each neighborhood.We move forward, we move strong, to raise our party as high as possible! To make our people breathe!To finally open the way for the great, the beautiful, the shocking!
