Friends, compañeras and compañeros,This day is not a coincidence, nor is the place where we find ourselves. Today we commemorate the anniversary of the Great Anti-Fascist Victory of the Peoples. The day when the Nazi beast capitulated unconditionally, after the red flag with the hammer and sickle had been stuck in his heart, in the Reichstag building.For today's anniversary, of course, the friends of the New Democracy and Syriza, the German Christian Democrats and Social Democrats who rule in the local state, have banned the red flag and the march "Holy War". They probably forget that this flag has never asked for permission to fly in Berlin, which is why the KKE forces, together with their comrades from the Communist Party of Turkey, broke this unacceptable ban again this year and commemorated the anti-fascist victory in the iconic Treptauer Park, where 7,000 Soviet soldiers who fell in the battles of Berlin are buried.
