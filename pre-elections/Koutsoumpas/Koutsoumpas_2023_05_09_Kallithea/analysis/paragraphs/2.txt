We commemorate today's anniversary here, in Kallithea of the Resistance, in Kallithea of EAM and ELAS, of the EPONites and the "Eagle Boys", who gave their best children to the blockade. Its people, with the communists as always in the front line, fought, gave their blood to get rid of the Nazi occupiers, to breathe free in a more just homeland.It is no coincidence that the monument of the Soviet Soldier is located here. In this heroic city, one of the most characteristic moments was recorded, when Greeks, communists and patriots, fought and died together, side by side with Soviet soldiers. They spilled the same blood, murdered by the fire of the Nazi conquerors and their local collaborators.This statue was vandalized last year by some admirers of the Nazi Azov battalion, a few days before their idols appeared in Parliament to receive the applause of the members of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK parties, while Mera25 was running to get out in time to escape the humiliation, after having reverently watched the Azov leader Zelensky.Only the KKE benches were empty, once again saving the honour of our people and putting into practice the slogan "only them and all of us"!
