Yes! We lived the youth struggles. The students' struggles for protective measures in schools. Of the students to keep the university police from setting foot inside. All the young people who left behind those who were fighting over whose buffoon is the stationmaster and took to the streets to ensure that the predestined crime in Tempe is not forgotten. For human lives to finally stop being weighed in the same balance as profit.We experienced the great victory of the students in last year's student elections, which demolished the ruling GOP and brought the party of the KNE to the first place after 36 years. Last year the step was taken. Tomorrow, in the student elections, let the leap be made, despite the orgy of rigging by the GOP and other misfits. The youth should send a message that cannot be ignored, 11 days before the parliamentary elections. It will be heard loudly again: All-University First Force! And it will give the answer that suits those who think they can buy the conscience of the youth with two tickets on deck for an island in the Cyclades, as Mitsotakis is trying to do during the election campaign.
