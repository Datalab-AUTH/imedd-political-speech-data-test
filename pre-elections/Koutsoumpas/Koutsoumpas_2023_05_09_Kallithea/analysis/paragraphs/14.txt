Friends, From these popular neighbourhoods of Kallithea, with hundreds of small businesses in every street and neighbourhood struggling for daily survival, we address a militant call for solidarity to the thousands of freelancers in the country, to small traders, craftsmen, motorists.We call on them to use their experience, to take the step and support the KKE. Because the KKE is the only party that has been on their side in every problem, in every deadlock they have experienced and are living through all these last years.
