Any ordinary person you ask will tell you one thing by instinct: "Whoever comes out will do the same thing." After all, we have seen it time and time again. And they are right. That's what the KKE says. That everyone else agrees on the critical things, the things that define our lives. That's why they have a common program. They are committed to serving this system, the interests and goals of those who hold the real power in this country: The industrialists, the shipowners, the bankers, the bankers, all kinds of "investors" - robbers - all those who live a life spoiled by the work of our own class, our own people. The election programmes of these parties, the 50 and 100 day programmes as they say, are made fancy, and they choose nice locations to present them. We would say that they are reminiscent of the contracts that banks sign with borrowers. They are presented in an attractive way, but the traps are hidden in the fine print, in the things that are not said.In the fine print of the election manifestos of both the New Democracy and Syriza parties, one can read their vows of loyalty to the Recovery Fund, the EU's super-memorandum with its harsh anti-people's preconditions and the commitments that its money will only end up with big business interests.It will read about the investment grade target, the assessments for which are made on the basis of specific criteria: extension of anti-labour legislation, privatisations, auctions, bloody surpluses, etc.It will read about the European Green Deal that will bring guaranteed profits to capital and very expensive "green" goods in Energy, transport, houses, food for the people.All the above and more is the "big picture" that will determine the programme of the next government. Any pre-election proclamations are just mockery, as has been proven in the past.
