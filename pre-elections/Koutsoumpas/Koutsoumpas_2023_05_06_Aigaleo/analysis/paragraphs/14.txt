Friends, comrades, all these years, from 2012 until today, the KKE has been the only one that has kept the flag of progress and struggle high. That insisted that there is another way from the "yes to everything", from the will of the exploiters and the imperialist centres, the EU, the USA and NATO. Who made sure that the anti-people's measures are not passed "unanimously" and with complete unanimity. Which, here in the western districts of Athens, as the third largest political force, but also in the whole country, was on the side of the poor, continuing to fight for the people's movement to rise up. And in recent years, indeed, something seems to be changing.
