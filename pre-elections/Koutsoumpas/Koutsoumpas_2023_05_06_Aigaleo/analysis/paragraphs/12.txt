It has washed them out, to a large extent, in the eyes of the people, since it has instilled in an even larger part of them the view that "there is no alternative", the most conservative view there can be.
Now he tells us that if we don't support him or show tolerance, we will open the way for Mitsotakis, but it was Syriza's governance, the dashing of the hopes that he had previously traded in by the kilo, that opened the way for ND and Mitsotakis to return in 2019. It is always the same people who pave the way for maintenance.SYRIZA paved the way for ND to get 23,000 more votes here, in the working-class neighbourhoods of the Western Sector of Athens, in 2019, compared to 2015.Since then, four more years of cruel anti-people's policies of the ND government have passed, in which SYRIZA was essentially a co-sponsor. When with its bills that it voted for, more than 200 in number! When with the back it put in critical moments for the people: the pandemic, the outbreak of the imperialist war, the natural disasters where the criminal inefficiency of the bourgeois state was revealed, the predictable crime of Tempi.So now, in 2023 and with all this experience that our people have accumulated, SYRIZA remembered the "responsibilities" of the KKE (for some reason that only it knows) to support it in order to sit in the government chairs!! They didn't get slaughtered... This can only sound like a joke today; but, didn't we do it in 2012 and 2015... Do they really think there is any chance of us doing them a favour now? Put our hands up and gouge out our own and the people's eyes?
