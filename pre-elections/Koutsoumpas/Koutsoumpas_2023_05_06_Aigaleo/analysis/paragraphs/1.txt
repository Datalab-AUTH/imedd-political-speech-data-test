Friends, compañeras and compañeros. And from here, from Egaleo, from the western districts of Athens, where the lives of tens of thousands of working-class families are squeezed, here where the hope for a better tomorrow passes every day through individual and collective toil and struggle, we want to address our hopeful call: Now is the time for decisive support and strengthening of the KKE! In the elections of May 21, we can terrorize those who terrorize us. We can neutralize their dilemmas and blackmail. To think and choose this time on the basis of our own interests, our own anxieties and our own needs.The thousands of workers, the unemployed who live in these neighbourhoods, the high school students who will be voting for the first time, the young people studying at the University of West Attica, the women who carry double and triple burdens at work and in the family, all of them know in their hearts that they have nothing substantial to expect from any government that is formed, among the parties that have ruled so far, ND, SYRIZA and PASOK and their various willing partners. They are not touched by the cockfights that take place for show, between those who have implemented and are alternately implementing the same and unchanging policy on the basic issues, for the benefit of the few.
