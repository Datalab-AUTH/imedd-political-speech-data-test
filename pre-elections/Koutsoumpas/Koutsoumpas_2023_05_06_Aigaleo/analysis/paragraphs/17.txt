Because the truth, which no one is telling them, is that for the workers to win something here and now, capital has to lose. That is why the solution for a real strengthening of wages lies in the KKE's proposal, which can only be imposed by the workers' movement with its struggle and with a much stronger KKE; that is, to impose the restoration of the collective bargaining of the National General Collective Agreement as a starting point for raising the minimum wage by adopting the unions' demands for increases above 850 euros and the simultaneous restoration of the three-year minimum wage. This practically means that a worker with a three-year contract will see his salary increase to 935 euros today and not in 2027 as promised by the New Democracy.This proposal is linked to the other proposals of the KKE for a fixed daily working time, 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours and no unpaid overtime, with the reintroduction of Sunday-working days.It is linked to the proposal for an inflation-based wage adjustment clause. With the restoration of the 13th and 14th wages in the public sector, about which the New Democracy and SYRIZA do not say a word, and the granting of all wage scales.With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles, we can impose the restoration of the sectoral Collective Labour Agreements and their compulsory nature without terms and conditions, which is a basic condition for increasing wages in all scales.This is the only pro-people's answer to the lies of the New Democracy, SYRIZA and PASOK, that the average wage will supposedly increase without repealing the laws that have undermined the Collective Labour Agreements.
