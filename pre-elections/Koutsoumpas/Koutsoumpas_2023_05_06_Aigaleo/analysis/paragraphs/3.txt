So we say to you: Don't waste your time looking for minor differences that exist, but which do not change the situation of the people of our region. The only anxiety that you all should have, which we have too, is how high, how much stronger the KKE will be! Because that is what can shake them up, make them think twice and thrice before bringing an unpopular measure to Parliament! Because they know that they will get hammered, not by 15, but by 30 or more MPs. Because this will also make the demands of the people stronger. Because it will not only be 15, but 30 or more MPs who will bring to Parliament, in the form of questions, amendments, legislative proposals, your problems, your demands, and will demand solutions and answers. Like the amendment we tabled for the requisition of the building where the 9th Elementary School of Egaleo is housed, to stop the eviction of the owner and, of course, many more, for the abolition of taxes, for an increase in wages, etc., because all these communist deputies are not limited to the benches of the House. They will be outside, in the real world, on the side of the people who are being tested by layoffs, by evictions, by repression, where, after all, is the natural place of the deputies of the KKE, of all our forces, and our people know this very well.
