Comrades, let us go strong in the remaining days. Let us give all our strength. Let there be no one left who thinks of strengthening the KKE, who is subjected to a thousand and two blackmails, who will not discuss with us, who will not answer our questions, who will not solve misunderstandings and even prejudices.Let us go to strengthen the KKE in the Western Sector of Athens, everywhere. In all the working-class neighbourhoods, in Egaleo, in Agia Varvara, in Haidari, in Peristeri. This is where the heart of the working class beats. And in the elections of May 21 this heart can beat loudly with the decisive support of the KKE. We are all of us: The working class people, the youth, their party the KKE! And they are alone: The big capitalist employers and their parties.On the evening of May 21, we the many, not the few, can smile. We can open a window to the future, to a promising future for ourselves and our children. We can do it! With JCE strong hope is here!
