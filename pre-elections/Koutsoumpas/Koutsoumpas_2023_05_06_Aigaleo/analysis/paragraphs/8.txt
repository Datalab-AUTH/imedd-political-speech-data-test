Yes, we agree we need to get rid of all of them. But the only way to truly rid our people of all of them, under whatever guise they appear, to rid them of their politics, of the interests they serve, is the Programme of Power and Governance proposed by the KKE. The Program that abolishes these interests, puts the economy to work for the needs of the many and no longer for the profits of the few, establishes institutions of real democracy, with elected and recallable representatives of the workers at all its levels.So, therefore, do not hesitate any longer. Make your thought a decision and your decision a deed. Make up your mind.
