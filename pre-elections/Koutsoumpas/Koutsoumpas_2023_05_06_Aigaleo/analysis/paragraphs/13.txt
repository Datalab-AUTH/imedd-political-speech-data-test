Of course they don't believe that. Their blackmail is not directed at the KKE in general, it is, in fact, blackmail to the people, blackmail to all those who have taken notice of them and are thinking of abandoning them. And they are not a few... It shows, above all, the great difficulty they have in convincing the progressive people of this country, the workers, the youth, even those who voted for them in 2019, that they are a real alternative to the South-West. We know, after all, that many of them are currently considering voting for the KKE. We therefore call on you to close your ears to the blackmail and take the big step up to the time of the ballot box. We are waiting for you beside us, to walk together on the same road of honesty. To fight together the great battles that our people need.
