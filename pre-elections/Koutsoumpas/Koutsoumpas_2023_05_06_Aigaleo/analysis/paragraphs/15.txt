The battles fought in the pandemic, breaking bans, for the health and life of the people, the strike battles in large workplaces and sectors, show the only realistic way to improve our lives here and now. They show that only the people can save the people with a much stronger KKE, because if we wait for the ND, PASOK and SYRIZA to bring wage increases, we will get tired of waiting. We have seen the increases of the ND in the past four years, which in the real wage translate into a reduction of more than 7% in 2022. We have seen them with all the governments that have cut the average wage 25% from what it was 10 years ago. They have led to just 17.5% of workers being covered by Collective Labour Agreements. They have generalized part-time and flexible work, meaning thousands of workers who don't even get the minimum wage. In fact, when the KKE submitted the law proposal that the trade unions had worked out to change all this here and now, SYRIZA rejected it both as a government and as an opposition.And Mr. Tsipras is deliberately lying when he says that in all EU countries the real wage went up and only in Greece it went down, because of Mitsotakis. And in Spain it went down, and in Portugal it went down, and in Germany it went down, that is, everywhere where his favourite 'progressive' governments exist - muff. This does not at all mean that the New Democracy government is not responsible. It means that it has a great responsibility for the EU decisions it has voted for, for the policies it implements in favour of business groups, for tax evasion, for the liberalisation of the energy market, for participation in the sanctions against Russia, etc.
