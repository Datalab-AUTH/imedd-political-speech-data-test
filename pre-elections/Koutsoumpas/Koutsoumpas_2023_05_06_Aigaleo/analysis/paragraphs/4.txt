Because this is the only way our people, the progressive people of this country, who are fed up with the Georgiades, the Hadjidakis and the rest of those who wag their finger at them, can smile, because they do not want to compromise with misery, but they do not want - and rightly so - to see anyone washing them again "from the left" to return "from the right"!
He cannot listen to Mitsotakis, from here in Egaleo, asking for support, because he says that "we must not risk our conquests, we must not discount our claims"!
But who is counting conquests these four years? The people or the monopolies? Yes, a great conquest for the monopolies is the labour jungle created by one after another by the parties of capital. And one of the greatest conquests of the parties of capital is the Hatzidakis law, this abomination, half of which SYRIZA also voted for. However, they were quickly cut off, because we stepped forward in the workplaces so that this miserable law would remain on paper. Yes, it is a great victory for the monopolies to promote the green growth strategy that has brought precision, energy poverty, exorbitant bills and even power cuts to popular households. We know this first-hand, because our own forces are intervening everywhere, including here in Egaleo, to ensure that the electricity is not cut off in people's homes.
