The well-known and unexceptional Varoufakis, who informed us that "anyone who feels rage and has no other way to express it is a fascist!" These are unacceptable and dangerous views that must meet with the unanimous condemnation of all democratic people. It is as if all these people, young people and young women, who demonstrated under the slogan 'their profits or our lives', did not have their unions, their student associations, their student councils and could not express their anger collectively and in an organised manner, because of the tragedy of Tempi. As if anyone who gets angry automatically becomes a fascist, as if by instinct. As if history does not teach us who demonstrably supported Hitler before WWII, namely the biggest German and international monopolies. As if we don't remember the Goldilocks setting up a slave trade office in Perama to provide cheap labour to the contractors and shipowners who supported them in every way possible. The fascists, then and now, are the watchdogs of the capitalist system. The system itself strengthens them when it needs them, in order to turn them against the people who are struggling, and whenever it wants to pick on them again. That is why no one and no one who is angry with this system and its crimes has any reason to support the system's biggest minions. The only guarantee, both to express opposition to the system and to prevent the Nazi criminals from daring to come out of their holes again, is the vote, the great support of the KKE.
