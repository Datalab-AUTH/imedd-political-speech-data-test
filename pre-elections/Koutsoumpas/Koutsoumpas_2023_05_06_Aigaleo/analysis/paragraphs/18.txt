Friends, compañeras and compañeros.Here in the West of Athens, in the schools, in the neighbourhoods, in the workplaces, we have been fighting for over 10 years to isolate fascist and Nazi groups and gangs. And we are proud that in these neighbourhoods here they have found it very difficult to deal with the communists, the unions, the people of the region. We all rejoiced in October 2020, when we stood at that historic rally outside the Court of Appeals and heard the court ruling that characterized them for what they really are: a Nazi criminal organization that has no place in the jail except in prison!But we have never nurtured and cultivated any illusions that we are done with Nazism or that we can ever be done with it for good as long as the exploitative system of capitalism that breeds and feeds them remains. We called for vigilance and we are doing the same now. It did not take long, after all, for one by one, the convicted Nazis to get out of prison with light leaps.We say responsibly to the people, to the workers, that we are very much concerned about the dangerous game that various people have been playing lately. From the moment the magnificent mobilizations of the people and youth over the crime in Tempe broke out, and without there being any such indication in reality, articles and reports began to rain down on the possibility of strengthening such forces, as an alleged result of the youth's anger, even baptizing them as anti-systemic!Then they gave them plenty of free pre-election TV advertising time, on the occasion of the regulation brought by the government at the last minute before the Parliament closed, and while we could not even discuss this issue if the trial that has been dragging on for 8 years now, with huge responsibilities of both the previous SYRIZA government and the current ND government, had been finalized.And now we are watching an election game of who will fish better in the dirty waters of the far right and fascism.
Either with the ND trying to hit parties that are cutting off their votes, or with SYRIZA taking them under its wing. Either with Mitsotakis making a campaign show from the Evros fence, addressing this audience, or with Tsipras carousing with far-rightists as he did the other day in Menidi and adopting the anti-communism of the bourgeois staff and Nazi propaganda about the Soviet Union!
