So, when they talk about conquests, they talk about all that they give, that they offer with their laws to the industrialists, to the shipowners, to the bankers, to all the exploiters in order to make their profits... And when they talk about demands, they talk again about their own demands that they are planning to implement. We, when we talk about conquests, about the rights and needs of the workers, about all that today offers relief to the people's families, we talk about. This is the content of our demands, and if one thing is proven every day, it is that profits and privileges for capital are not compatible with the needs and rights of the workers and the people.
