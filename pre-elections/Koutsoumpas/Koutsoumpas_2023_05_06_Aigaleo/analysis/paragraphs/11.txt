We warned the people, we went against the tide of that period, without taking into account the electoral costs. The day SYRIZA won the elections, in January 2015, "Rizospastis" wrote on the front page: "The memorandum of ND is leaving, the memorandum of SYRIZA is coming". On the day of the referendum - a fraud, he wrote: "their NO is YES to a new memorandum".Who was really verified? And we now see some SYRIZA ministers, like Varoufakis, who at the time were wagging their finger at us along with Mr. Tsipras, who sat on the same benches with the far-right ANEL, who participated in the deception, asking for the vote of the people, pretending to be immaculate and untainted, since they resigned, they say, in time after the referendum. Well, we don't have a goldfish's memory...Back then, many working people, breadwinners, under the pressure of problems, of impoverishment, of unemployment, under the longing for a change, at least a relief, wanted to give it a try. The path proposed by Syriza seemed to them more direct and realistic than the one proposed by the KKE. This is how SYRIZA hijacked the vote of many left-wing, progressive people.We know the outcome. The policy they pursued from 2015 to 2019 was the absolute vindication, not of course of the struggles of EAM and ELAS, but of the policy that had been pursued all the previous years by the governments of ND and PASOK.
