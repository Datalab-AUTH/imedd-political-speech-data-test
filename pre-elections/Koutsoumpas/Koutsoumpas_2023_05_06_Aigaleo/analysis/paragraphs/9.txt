Friends, compañeras and compañeros. Mr. Tsipras and the SYRIZA cadres constantly refer to the KKE and - with great self-confidence - declare that it is one thing what the parties say during the pre-election and another thing what they will do after the election. As far as this is concerned, they know something, we don't doubt it... So they say that after the elections "the KKE will have to take responsibility" for whether we prefer a Syriza government with PASOK, or whether we will open the way for Mitsotakis.You will have heard us say many times that we are not in 2012 or 2015. Let's think a little more carefully about what that means, what has changed since then... You know, today is the 11th anniversary of the elections of May 2012, which, in the midst of a deep capitalist crisis, brought about major rearrangements in the bourgeois political system, in the correlation between the bourgeois parties.The two parties - ND and PASOK - that had been in power since the post-war period were crushed, especially PASOK, which traditionally enclosed a large part of the working and popular classes, but also ND.
It was the first time that SYRIZA, a small party of the compromised left, of opportunism as we call it in our theory, became the official opposition.
