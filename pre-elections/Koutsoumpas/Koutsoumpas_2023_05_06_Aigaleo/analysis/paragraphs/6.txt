Yes, a great conquest for the various investors is the developments with the shipyards that are touching here in the area, Skaramanga, but also Elefsina. And Mitsotakis has a lot of nerve coming here to Egaleo and advertising his law on the Elefsina Shipyards, where a new economic zone is being created and the workers no longer have any labour rights. Who gave him this opportunity to do this? SYRIZA, which passed this law. Yes, unfortunately, this abomination was also voted for by SYRIZA MPs, which is why Georgiades praised them. So who is fighting against Mitsotakis? The one who votes for his laws or the one who votes against them in parliament and leads the fight to annul them outside? On the Elefsina shipyards, indeed, Mitsotakis did say something here in Egaleo. On the Skaramagas shipyards, where the shipowner Prokopiou is planning a power plant, possibly an LNG storage facility, he said nothing. What could he say? That he has given the green light for a ticking time bomb to be installed in the homes of ordinary families, next to their children's schools? But they are reckoning without the hotelier. Because, with the city's mass organizations in the lead, an entire city has risen up to thwart their plans.
