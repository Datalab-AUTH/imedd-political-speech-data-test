What did SYRIZA start saying then in view of the next elections? They were saying "we will only cooperate with the KKE to make the government of the left, to vindicate the struggles of EAM and ELAS, to abolish the memoranda, to restore labour rights", even that they would open the road to socialism, depending on the audience.They even accused the KKE of not feeling its historical responsibility, of betraying the people and its history, and other such shameless things, but they caressed the ears of some honest people, of militants. Imagine if we could transfer to the future, to the present, a man who believed SYRIZA then. To show him Mr Tsipras: Declaring that his current program has the approval of the German Chancellor, saying that the funds, to which he has meanwhile given the red loans, will benefit from the regulation he proposes for the red loans, welcoming to his ballot papers the former government representative of the "infamous right" Antonaros, and so much more. Would he believe his eyes?We, of course, knew for better or for worse what SYRIZA is from its foundation and much earlier. But we also saw its rapid transformation. We saw the credentials it presented to the forums of capital, domestic and international, making it clear that it would not touch a hair of their interests. We saw the mechanisms, the cadres of the old PASOK moving in an organized way to Syriza.We knew, of course, from our analysis and from historical experience, that no government on the soil of capitalism, regardless of even intentions, can pursue a policy that goes against the general interests of the exploiters.These were what kept us from stepping on the banana peel.
