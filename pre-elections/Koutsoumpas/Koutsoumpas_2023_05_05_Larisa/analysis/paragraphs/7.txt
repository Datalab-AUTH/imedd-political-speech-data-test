Yes, profits and losses were counted by the New Democracy, promoting the so-called green transition, which is why the people's families are suffering from energy poverty and precision, which of course is not treated with baskets and passes of mockery. Of course, it is not only the New Democracy party that claims the privilege of mockery, but also SYRIZA and PASOK, which share the same strategy. That is why they voted with ND to make energy and fuel taxes permanent. The parties of bourgeois management count profits and losses, which is why their government programmes, one could say, have been written by the same hand.
