Friends, compañeras and compañeros. New Democracy, SYRIZA and PASOK want to count profits for the Greek bourgeoisie, and that is why they are competing with each other to see who will best implement the dangerous plans of the USA and NATO. It is no coincidence that these very issues are absent from the debate between them, from the political debate as a whole. Did you see them arguing about Greece's involvement in the imperialist war in Ukraine? About the so-called defence agreements, which are far from aggressive, which Syriza started and ND completed with the US and we have now reached the point where we have filled bases, ports, airports and other infrastructure in the service of the US and NATO, which are also the target of retaliation? Did you see them arguing today in any panels about the news of the day, highlighted by Rizospastis, namely the Commission's announcements on the transition of the EU countries' - and Greece's - war industry to a "war economy" mode?Nor are you going to see them.
