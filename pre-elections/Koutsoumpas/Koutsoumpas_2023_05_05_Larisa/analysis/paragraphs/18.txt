Friends, compañeras and compañeros. We want from here, from Larissa, which became the epicentre of the unspeakable tragedy with the hundred of young victims in Tempi, from the city whose people and youth honoured the victims in the most shocking way, by flooding streets and squares for two weeks, to send again the message that this people, this youth, does not forget the crime in Tempi. After the slogan, 'SYRIZA, PASOK, ND, this crime has a history', shouted by thousands of workers and young people, today there are more and more people who realise that the policy responsible for this tragedy is the policy that treats critical sectors for people's lives, such as transport and public transport, as a field of profitability for big capital and business groups. Every time, but every time, it turns out that profit and social needs are not compatible. Either the former will be served or the latter.But are these not the obsessions of the KKE, which will say the same thing no matter what happens, as some parrots have written and are writing?But none of them can hide: The special report of the European Court of Auditors on the railways revealed by "Rizospastis" spoke of a delay in the introduction of modern electronic systems in all EU countries! It even said that this delay can be attributed mainly to the reluctance of railway companies to invest in equipment because of the costs involved.
