Not everyone benefits from this goal, of course. It certainly benefits shipowners, energy groups and others, who see their profits increasing from the transport of US LNG and the implementation of new 'green' investments in the name of 'decoupling' from Russian gas. While, at the same time, the people are losing out, not only because they are being asked to pay the "price" with more expensive Energy and deepening energy poverty, but also because all these projects mean additional billions out of their pockets for new armaments that do not have the country's defence as a priority. Proof of the "Patriots" that went to Saudi Arabia and the "Leopards" they are discussing sending to Ukraine. We know that the people of Larissa, of Thessaly, can see that these plans are not a "guarantee" and a "shield" against Turkish aggression, as the government of the Southwest and the other parties mock; just as the NATO British bases in Cyprus were not a guarantee against the Turkish invasion and occupation.
