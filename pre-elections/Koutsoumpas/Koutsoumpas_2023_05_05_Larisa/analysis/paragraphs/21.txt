Friends and friends, the cause that led to the Tempi is what the people see before them every day. Thousands of students crammed into unsuitable buildings in the municipality of Larissa are finding it. In total, in the municipality of Larissa, 57 schools are housed in buildings that are characterised as ageing, having been built with little or no seismic specifications.Similarly, in the city of Larissa, the uneven crossings have turned into carmanioles, claiming the lives of many people, such as the crossing in Karla Street next to the 4th EPAL, the crossing at the ATA, the depot of the OSE in Mezourlo, where a few years ago a 15-year-old student was struck by lightning, in the "damaria" of N. Smyrna, where in 2017 a 10-year-old child was swept away and lost his life. The cause is found by hundreds of earthquake victims living in containers, two years after the earthquake of March 3, 2021. Thousands of people who are shaking their foliage in case they get sick find it, as public hospitals are straining with staff and infrastructure shortages. Hundreds of workers who lack essential health and safety conditions in their workplaces.
