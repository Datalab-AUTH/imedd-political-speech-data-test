This unpopular direction, determined by the EU's policy of "liberalisation" and the strategy of capital, is today agreed upon by ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, MERA25, all the parties of the system. That is why we say: There is no room for any more illusions! No one should be trapped again by the offer of phony salvation solutions, by a supposedly "more progressive government" the next day. Neither a better privatisation, nor a supposedly stricter public control, nor a 're-nationalisation without compensation' will save us! As long as transport is a commodity and the railway companies operate within the capitalist economy, the situation cannot be radically, fundamentally changed.
