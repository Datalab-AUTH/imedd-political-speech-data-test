We address especially the youth and those who are voting for the first time and we tell them to remember: when you were taking to the streets by the thousands, SYRIZA was telling you that "this is not the time to take responsibility".  At the same time, the MP25, which, through Mr Varoufakis, at the crucial moment, said 'no anger, no protest, no condemnation at the polls'. The KKE, on the contrary, has the people and the youth for much more than mere spectators of developments, or mere voters every four years. It has them as protagonists, as those who will shape and determine the developments in our country. For those who will take power and, with the KKE in the lead, will exercise governance in a new Greece, different from the one we live in today, free from the bosses, the exploitation of man by man, profit.Well, let's make this fear of theirs their nightmare! And their nightmare a reality! Let the people be powerful, with the KKE much stronger, and they weak, dazed, frightened against it!Only in this way will the road to better days for the new generation, for our people be opened. Their system is afraid of the anti-systemic vote in the KKE, but the new generation is fed up with their system! That's why, now, lots of young red votes! Those young people who are voting for the first time should vote anti-systemic, against the system of profit and exploitation, vote for the KKE.Our people, and especially the young generation, have a great opportunity this year. This time, after the elections, let them be counted and come out fewer! Let us be counted and come out more. Because it is ONLY THEM and we are ALL OF US. KKE is strong then, and in Larissa and in all of Thessaly, in all of Greece!
