Our proposal for wage increases is linked to the other proposals of the KKE for a fixed daily working time, 7-hour, 5-day, 35-hour working hours and no unpaid overtime, with the reintroduction of Sunday-work. It is linked to the proposal for an inflation-based wage adjustment clause. With the restoration of the 13th and 14th salaries in the public sector, about which the Southwest and Syriza say nothing, and the granting of all pay scales. With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles, we can impose the restoration of the sectoral Collective Labour Agreements and their compulsory nature, without terms and conditions, which is a basic condition for increasing wages in all scales. This is the only pro-people's answer to the lies of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK, that the average wage will supposedly increase without repealing the laws that have undermined the Collective Labour Agreements.
