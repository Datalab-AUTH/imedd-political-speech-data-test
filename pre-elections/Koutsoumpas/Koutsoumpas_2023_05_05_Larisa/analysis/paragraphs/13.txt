So now is the opportunity to send a message with their vote. To turn their backs on ND, SYRIZA and PASOK who have turned Greece into a base for imperialist war. To turn their backs on those forces that hypocritically talk about "rupture", such as MERA 25, but only create illusions that those who make wars can also impose peace. They should resolutely support the KKE, which, with consistency of words and deeds, fought against the war and the participation of the country in it, at the responsibility of the governments, on the side of the NATO murderers. A fact that turns Larissa, Volos, Alexandroupolis and every corner of our country into a target of the opposite side of the war.Who else revealed to the people their plans and how they are being implemented in every corner of Greece?  Only the KKE!Only the KKE reveals with its action that the wider region of Thessaly plays a key role in the plans of the USA and NATO, with all the last governments having officially turned it into an American-NATO war bridgehead for attacks against other peoples.
