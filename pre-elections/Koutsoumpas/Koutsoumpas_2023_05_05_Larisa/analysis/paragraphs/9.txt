Friends, compañeras and compañeros, Since we are here tonight in Larissa, in the Thessalian plain, we want to address the farmer and livestock farmer who is fighting for survival every day. We invite him to think that the policy implemented successively by all the last governments in our country is responsible for the continuous reduction of his income. Governments that had and still have as their common program the guidelines of the CAP, the interests of business groups.He should think that the New Democracy - Syriza - PASOK together support the one-sided orientation to the export of agricultural products, which benefits the commercial industrialists, while the massive imports add new difficulties to the life of farmers, degrading the quality of basic foodstuffs of the people. Together they voted for the 3rd memorandum, which cut the reimbursement of the special excise duty on agricultural diesel. It is no coincidence that all of them, in the face of the demand for guaranteed prices for products, are advocating the one-way CAP, which is going from bad to worse for the interests of the majority of farmers and, with its current revision (2023-2027), puts new obstacles to your survival. New Democracy - SYRIZA - PASOK together have formed an ELGA that wastes and hardly compensates. Together they have signed up to sanctions on Russia that are ultimately paid for by the farmers and all the people.
