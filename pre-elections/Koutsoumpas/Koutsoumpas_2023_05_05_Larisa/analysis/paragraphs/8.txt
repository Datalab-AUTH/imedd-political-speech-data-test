Just reading the headlines, one understands that despite their quarrels, despite their differences, they can form a government on May 22. So let one of them, Mitsotakis, with his self-reliance, and the other, Tsipras, with his allegedly progressive government, leave the blackmailing dilemmas about ungovernability. And he even has the audacity to call on the KKE "to take responsibility"! We could say a lot but we don't need to... Only what is well known to the workers, the breadwinning farmers and self-employed, the young children and women here in Larissa, in the whole of Thessaly. When SYRIZA, together with ND and PASOK, was counting profits and losses for capital during these four years, we, the KKE, were counting human lives. That is why we went to every workplace, in every town and village, in schools and colleges to organise the struggle of the workers, the people and the youth.We have taken on this great responsibility and we continue on this road with even greater determination, stubbornness and militancy. That is why today more and more people are thinking of supporting and voting for the KKE. Because they now see that a strong KKE means a strong people.
