All this at a time when the US-NATO-EU war with Russia and its allies on the territory of Ukraine is escalating, with the possibility of escalation. Already, war conflicts and hot spots of tension are multiplying all over the planet, reinforcing the fact that the whole of Thessaly, our country in general, is becoming a war base at the expense of other peoples and at the same time making our people the victim and target of retaliation by rival imperialist centres.The involvement of our country in the war in Ukraine, in the overall plans of the USA and NATO, not only does not separate ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, but on the contrary, it is the glue for the formation of the next anti-people's government, whoever is first, ND or SYRIZA in the elections. Because ND, SYRIZA and PASOK meet in the goal for the geostrategic upgrading of the country's ruling class, for the transformation of Greece into an "energy hub" in the wider region, serving the interests of capital, the few and creating new dangers.
