Our needs do not fit into the system of profit and exploitation that they all serve. And if some people had some illusions, today they have none! For they have lived, we have lived a tragedy here in this place, we have lived a great crime, the crime in Tempe.  'You count profits and damages, we count human lives', thousands of people, thousands of young children, students, pupils and pupils here in Larissa, all over Greece, shouted. Only that this slogan not only shows the real culprits, the causes of the predestined crime in Tempe that cost the lives of 57 people, but also the real cause of what we are living through.
