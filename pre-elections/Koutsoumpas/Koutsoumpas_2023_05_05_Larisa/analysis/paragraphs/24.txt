The "Never again" that the people and the youth of Larissa shouted, with the participation in the magnificent mobilizations with the new qualitative characteristics that they had, has a ballot paper in the ballot box: The ballot paper with the hammer and sickle of pride and disobedience. The slogans that were shouted in the street, the criterion with which we fought or the criterion with which we rallied in Trade Unions, Unions, can be expressed in the ballot box of the parliamentary elections on May 21, so that there can be political punishment for those who, by defending the system of rot and exploitation, murder the dreams and rights of the youth, of the people's families.
