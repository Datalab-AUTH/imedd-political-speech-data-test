Only the KKE reveals that, in Larissa in particular, as a consequence of the "updates" of the despicable Agreement on the bases, the "upgrading" of the city's military installations is proceeding, for the benefit of the dangerous plans of the US in its confrontation with Russia and China.Specifically, US Air Force fighter jets have been in Larissa for months, with their support personnel, to spy on a wider area - including the one in which the imperialist war in Ukraine is unfolding. These are aircraft like the one that crashed after an engagement with a Russian fighter aircraft near Crimea, which warns of the grave consequences of our country's involvement in imperialist interventions and wars. The KKE alone reveals to the people of the region that, at the same time, the Americans are pouring more than $33 million into the airport so that it can accommodate "high-value assets", such as certain aerial refueling aircraft that are often stationed there.
