In Thessaly alone, there are an average of 200 work "accidents" per year. After all, what happened in Tempe happens in all our lives, in our everyday life. A system, a state, a policy, which, in order to serve the interests of the few, of the business groups, is constantly committing crimes against the workers and the people. Sometimes sacrificing our conditions of survival and our income, our rights, our modern needs, sometimes even sacrificing our very lives, as has happened in dozens of cases. The common denominator: their profits! This is how the ground is being paved for the next tragedies, for the next Tempi.
