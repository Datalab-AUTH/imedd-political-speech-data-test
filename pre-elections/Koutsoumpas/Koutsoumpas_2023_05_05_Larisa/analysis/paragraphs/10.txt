In this place, we know each other well. And the farmers and stockbreeders know very well who has been by their side and who has been against and against their interests. Now he can give up and give an account. He can see that precisely because the KKE is not bound by the interests of the big traders, the industrialists and the EU, it can take the lead, be in the struggles, give all its strength together with the farmers and cattle breeders, to reduce the cost of production by tax-free oil, ensuring cheap fertilizers, other raw materials, etc.etc., for guaranteed prices for their products to cover the cost of production and ensure a subsistence income, for the ELGA regulation to be changed to compensate 100% of the production, plant / animal capital from all natural hazards and all diseases, for immediate payment of compensation, for the creation of infrastructure projects and protection of production without charges and fees for the farmer, for the creation of infrastructure projects and protection of production without charges and fees for the farmer, for a change in the ELGA regulation to compensate 100% of the production, plant / animal capital from all natural hazards and all diseases, for immediate payment of compensation, for the creation of infrastructure projects and protection of production without charges and fees for the farmer. All this will be claimed again in the Parliament and outside it, on the street, in the movement, in the struggles, in the blockades, with thousands of poor farmers and thousands of other workers, unions and mass organizations.And as experience shows here in the prefecture of Larissa, the peasantry, if something was won, it was won with its struggle and no government, neither that of the Southwest, nor that of SYRIZA, gave it away. It won it with its unyielding struggles.
