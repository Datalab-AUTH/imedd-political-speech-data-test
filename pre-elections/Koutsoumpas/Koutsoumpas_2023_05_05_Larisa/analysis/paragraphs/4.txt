But we measure the needs of the workers! That is why we are stepping forward in the struggle for a real strengthening of wages, which can only be imposed by the workers' movement with its struggle and with a much stronger KKE. That is, to impose the restoration of the collective bargaining of the National General Collective Agreement as a starting point for the increase of the minimum wage, adopting the demands of the trade unions for increases above 850 euros and the simultaneous restoration of the triennial wage. This practically means that a worker with a three-year contract will see his or her salary increase to 935 euros today, not in 2027 as promised by the ND.
