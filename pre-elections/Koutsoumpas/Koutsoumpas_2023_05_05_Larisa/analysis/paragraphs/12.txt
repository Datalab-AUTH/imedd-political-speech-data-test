But we insist on prioritising these issues and we - literally and figuratively - count human lives. The workers, the young people of Larissa, of all of Thessaly, who want to live in peace, who are anxious to see the powder of war accumulate and the imperialist confrontation in Ukraine escalate, and who understand the dangers for our country, are also counting their lives. We are addressing all those who not only cannot bear to see other peoples and their lands destroyed, but are also worried by our country's involvement in the imperialist war. To all those who do not tolerate, in silence, the land, air and sea of our country being turned into an American-NATO beachhead for the escalation of military confrontations in Ukraine and elsewhere.
