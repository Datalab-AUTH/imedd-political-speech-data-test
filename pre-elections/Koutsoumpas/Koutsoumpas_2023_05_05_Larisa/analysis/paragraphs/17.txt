The Thessalian people can reject the arguments for supposedly "strengthening the local economy" due to the presence of foreign military forces! We are talking first of all about money that is stained with the blood of thousands of people who have been killed over the years in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Ukraine and in so many other wars. We are also talking about a "development" that is synonymous with rot, corruption and decadence, leading regions to turn into 1960s Trumps.  As they thought about the Tempis, so they should think about the issue of involvement in US and NATO plans, and reject them. Because yes, we do count human lives!
