Friends, compañeras and compañeros. Tonight, from Larissa, from this great gathering, we send a message of optimism, hope, a message of decisive strengthening of the KKE. Yes, there is no doubt, all the messages from all over Greece say this: that on May 21, our people can make a surprise, bringing the KKE much higher! Our people can turn their backs on the blackmailing dilemmas, they can disable the traps set for them, they can reach the ballot box based on their own needs. There can be no more postponement. This must be done! We must put our own needs first because today, more than ever, what in previous years could be hidden or not seen clearly by some, is now projected before everyone quite clearly...
