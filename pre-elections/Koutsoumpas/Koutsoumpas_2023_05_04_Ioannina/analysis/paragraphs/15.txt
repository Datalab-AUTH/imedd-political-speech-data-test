Friends, Compañeras and Compañeros, In Ioannina everyone can see the results of this common health policy, whether we look at the two public hospitals of the city or the Health Centres of the Epirus region. At the moment, the University General Hospital of Ioannina is receiving a huge number of cases, as a result of the conversion of the health system into a 'one disease' system during the pandemic period. All these cases are being treated with 600 vacant permanent staff positions! 450 employees are contract workers, in permanent hostage or permanent rotation! 150 contract workers in cleaning, catering and security, are under dismissal from December 2021 for a contractor to re-enter and with their struggle alone they have managed to stay on the job until September!  The staff are physically and mentally exhausted. Similarly, at the city's historic hospital, Hadjikosta, understaffing is combined with the highest average age of staff, who are constantly retiring without replacement. Every day, doctors are transferred from these hospitals and the prefectural hospitals to other hospitals in Epirus and Corfu, which are in a state of complete disintegration. On the other hand, private diagnostic centres are springing up every day. Whatever new infrastructure is being built, under the sponsorship of various merciful shipowners, does not mean new staff, but rather fillets to keep the health business going. And they are so unscrupulous that they are doing crazy business in childhood cancer and other areas, but at the same time they cannot secure a few nurses to reopen 6 of the 9 operating rooms at the University of Ioannina, or even build a pediatric ICU bed.
