We have an obligation, therefore, to stand up to the next government, whatever its colour, that will continue to serve the same god of profit and we will do so, as we have done unceasingly, unwaveringly for many years now. Our witness is the working class, the entire people of Ioannina and the people of Ioannina. We say it and we believe it: a much stronger KKE is the only positive result that the ballot boxes of May 21 can produce. All the strength that the people will give to the KKE will be used to bring to the fore their own needs, the needs of the new generation, needs that will not be satisfied even in the eternal century, when the criterion of development remains capitalist profit.
