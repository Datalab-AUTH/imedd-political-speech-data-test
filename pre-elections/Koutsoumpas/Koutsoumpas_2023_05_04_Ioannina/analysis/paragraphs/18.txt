And they are not going to let this anger be hijacked by any of the forces of the system, especially its biggest minions, the far-right, the hidden and open fascists and pro-Nazi criminals. It is, after all, so 'anti-systemic' are these forces, which used to set up slave offices to provide workers without rights to shipowners and contractors. But what are they doing today? One day they put a deputy prosecutor of the Supreme Court in the lead and the next day they put professors from the Evelpidon school, while all the mainstream media devote free TV time to them. You can't get more "systemic" than that...
