Friends, compañeras and compañeros. Just over two weeks remain until the polls open and close. And once they reopen for counting, much will be decided. No, it will not be mainly the policies and character of the next government that will be decided. But it will be the power of the people. How prepared they will be, how many resources they will have, to fight the battles of the next day, to finally pave the way for the radical changes that the country needs at the level of power and the economy. Just think how much of what we have experienced in this four-year period, how many of the trials our people have gone through, one could accurately predict in 2019. Does anyone really believe that the next four years will be calm and smooth? Not even the government who makes vague promises during the pre-election campaign about wage increases "if all goes well". Therefore, we call on you all and sundry to take action now. Here in Ioannina, you know well that the people fight their battles better together with the KKE. The workers know it, who have had a militant Labour Centre at their side for the last few years. A Labour Centre that is in the front line for the organisation of the workers' struggles, of demands, of solidarity with lessons for the children of families who cannot afford schooling, with a presence where evictions and auctions are taking place. The students know it, who have made the Panspoudasisti the leading force in the University of Ioannina for the last two years and will make it again next Wednesday in Ioannina and all over the country. The students who took to the streets en masse here in Ioannina after the crime in Tempe know it, demonstrating their anger against this system that puts human life on the scales of profit.
