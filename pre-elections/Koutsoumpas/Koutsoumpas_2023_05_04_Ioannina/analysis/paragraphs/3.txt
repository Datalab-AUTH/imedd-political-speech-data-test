That the slogan "only the people save the people" was put into practice in many cases, when the hostile bourgeois state was absent or even opposed, when lives and property were sacrificed for profits. But in the pandemic, in the fires, in the blizzards, in the accidents, in the auctions and evictions, the communists were always there, candle lit beside the people. They did not count on effort, sacrifice and prohibitions. Together we went through it all and stayed strong.
