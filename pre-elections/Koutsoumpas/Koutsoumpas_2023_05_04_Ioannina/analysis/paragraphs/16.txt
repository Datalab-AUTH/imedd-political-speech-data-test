On the other side is the action and positions, the daily struggle of the KKE and the people. The KKE in the Parliament, with more than 600 parliamentary interventions in the past four years, but mainly through its action in the movement, has shown that the power given to it by the people is deposited in the struggle for the defence and promotion of the working people's interests. The KKE is committed to these and not to the profitability of the private groups in the health sector that year after year break every profit record. Along with the daily struggle for the slightest thing concerning the protection of the health and life of the people, the KKE has for years been waging an unyielding struggle with the real solution in sight. And the real permanent solution is the abolition of any business action in health, with the development of a single, modern, exclusively state-run and free health system, developed nationwide, with central planning, fully and adequately financed from the state budget, based on the criterion of complete and absolutely free prevention, care and rehabilitation.
