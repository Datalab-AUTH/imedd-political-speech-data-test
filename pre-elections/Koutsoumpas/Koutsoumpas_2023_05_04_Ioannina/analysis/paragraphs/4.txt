All this is not easy to forget in the few days of the election period, no matter how much the needle is stuck on who will govern with whom. Just as it is also difficult to hide what is to come the next day, which will be even more difficult, regardless of the "colour" of the government that is finally formed. That is why the South West even remembered the closed banks of 2015, lest we forget that it is now 2023 and open banks are closing houses. That is why the leadership of SYRIZA is getting angry and is being driven to negligence. It even went so far as to talk about the KKE's responsibility because, he says, we are not interested in who will govern. And if we don't give him, he says, the deputies he will need to govern with PASOK, we are opening the way for Mitsotakis.... For God's sake, what else will we hear from them... But... they are! Such fiddlers they have always been...
