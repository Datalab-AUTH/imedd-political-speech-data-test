But who can really forget what we lived through the pandemic? When the ND government protected the private groups from treating patients with COVID-19, it heavily subsidized them to speculate on human suffering, either with tests or other morbidity, since public hospitals became "one disease" hospitals? Wasn't it then that PASOK agreed to everything and Syriza's "we'll settle this later" proposed a "minister of health of common consent"? In fact, this potential minister of the Mitsotakis government is now on the SYRIZA state ballot. These convergences in the criminal management of the pandemic, our people paid for them with thousands of deaths from covid and thousands more deaths from so-called other morbidity. We hear a lot about who is with the public health care system and who wants to privatize it.
