Friends and friends,
compa√±eras and comrades
We are here, in Ioannina, the capital of Epirus, continuing our great political expedition to the people, our great effort to reach every working man and woman, young and young, from every corner of Greece, to every working man and woman, the call to strengthen the KKE. Every day we meet and discuss with workers in the workplaces, with working people in the towns and villages, with young children in schools and colleges who are concerned, who hear for the first time what our Party says and think that now there is no more postponement. Now is the time to put our own needs and the needs of our children first. And here in Ioannina, the needs of the worker, the breadwinner, the farmer and the self-employed, of every young man and woman, are reflected only in the KKE's ballot paper. Yes, therefore, in the elections of May 21, an important step forward can be taken to strengthen the KKE as much as possible, to strengthen optimism, hope and, most importantly, to open our own road, the road of subversion.
