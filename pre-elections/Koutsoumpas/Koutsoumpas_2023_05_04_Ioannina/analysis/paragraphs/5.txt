Really, is it possible that we don't care who governs? Since we will be the ones who will stand against him, together with the people to prevent their unpopular measures. If, however, he accuses us of not helping either of them to govern at the expense of the people, yes, we are happy to accept that accusation. And anyway, it is not just us, but about 30% of the people and more who answer in all surveys that they do not prefer either of them. And the truth is that they've both gone to great lengths to achieve that result. We give them credit for that. We, however, take responsibility only to the Greek people and not to any would-be manager of the rot and their system.
