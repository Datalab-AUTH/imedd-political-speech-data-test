And it's screaming from everywhere! Not only from their governmental actions, but also from their governmental programs that one thinks were written by the same hand. There are many examples here in Epirus, in Ioannina. Shall we take the example of water, since we are in a city like Ioannina, where it rains half the year, has rich water sources and yet the people are deprived of access to cheap, quality water? At the same time, the bottling companies, (which Mitsotakis visited recently, not coincidentally, since his government's last bill was the one on water commercialization), these companies are losing count of their profits, they are celebrating new production units. On the one hand, the bottling companies have increased their water pumping, springs and communal lands are granted almost for free, municipalities and the Region make sure they are exempted from fines, and on the other hand, areas like Perama, Krya, Katsika, Amfithea and others experience systematic water cuts during the summer months. Kardamitsia and Pedini are flooded every year. The permanent staff of DEYAI has been halved since 2000 and at the same time the volume of work has increased dramatically. At the same time, in the 'largest natural mineral water bottling lines in Europe' - I use the Prime Minister's own words - seven-day workdays, intensification and 'hooded' work accidents are rife. These, after all, are what bring in the huge profits. Along, of course, with the stolen money of all the people, which, by taxing our families, is turned into grants for the "Development Laws" for the notorious investments! There is another example from the county that proves that popular welfare and capitalist development do not go hand in hand. Just a few days after the inauguration of the new production unit of the "DODONI" dairy by the Prime Minister, the organic farmers have seen another reduction in the price they pay for the milk they give, which no longer even covers the cost of production!
