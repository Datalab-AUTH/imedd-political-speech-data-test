Only the strength of the KKE is the measure of the power that the people will have after the elections. And the people of Ioannina have every interest in electing a communist MP for the first time in years. On the KKE's ballot paper here in Ioannina, too, they will find tried and tested militant workers, elected in their unions and their organisations, recognised by the people of the region, who they know will be on their side after the elections. So we continue the fight. We are making the most of every day, every hour that remains. With a good plan, with good organization of time and arrangement of our forces. Now the result is decided. It is now that no one who has fought with us, who is indignant at those who have ruled until now, who expects from the KKE, who has open ears towards us, who we will not discuss with him, who we will not invite him to a meeting, who we will not ask him to talk with others to go to the ballot box with the red ballot paper of the struggle. Now is when we all need to give the most we can. To lift our Party as high as we can. We can, we will. Good strength, good luck in the struggle. For the people to save the people, with a much stronger Communist Party!
