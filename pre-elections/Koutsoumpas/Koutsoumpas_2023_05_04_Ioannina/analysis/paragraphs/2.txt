We have made it clear from the beginning that the dilemma of stability, of so-called ungovernability, which the government of the Southwest and - with variations - the other forces are putting to the people, is blackmail and false. Because it is precisely because they agree on the basic line of travel that the Southwest, Syriza and PASOK can form a government, perhaps together with other willing parties, and it is a given that they will do so. And if they don't do it on May 22, it's not because they have difficulty, it's because they want to blackmail, to steal the people's vote again in every way possible. Of course, as the days go by, the blackmail escalates. It was expected, we expected it to happen. They are playing their hand to trap the people. To elicit their support for a policy that the next day will attack their income, their rights, their lives. They are all playing their part because they know that the prestige of the KKE among the people is elevated. That there are far more people than in the past who are "looking", who have no intention of voting for any of the parties that have ruled for at least the last 15 years and brought us to this point. Who tell us "you are the only ones who stand firm, you are constantly fighting for all of us". They know that our people and youth have been through a lot in the past four years as well.
