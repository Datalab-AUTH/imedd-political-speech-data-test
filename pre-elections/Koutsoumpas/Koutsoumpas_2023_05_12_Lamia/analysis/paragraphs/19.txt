Friends.In the past four years, New Democracy took the baton from SYRIZA and in turn proved to be the worst government. The KKE stepped forward in organising the struggle of the people, it proved and proves in practice what it means to save the people with KKE possible. Because when the government of the New Democracy was loosening the hands of big business in order to hit labour rights with the Hatzidakis law and SYRIZA and the other parties were saying with strikes, nothing is happening. The communists, the pioneer fighters, workers managed to prevent this implementation of this law, to cancel it in practice, to freeze it with their struggle, saving themselves. Because when the government of the New Democracy was trying to complete the crime in LARCO, the communists stepped forward in the struggle to stop them and proved that this enterprise is a real goldmine for this land. That is exactly how LARCO belongs to the workers.
