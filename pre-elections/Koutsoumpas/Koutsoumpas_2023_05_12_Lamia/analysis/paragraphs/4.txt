We also presented here in Fthiotida our proposals for the exploitation of the wealth of our region, such as the thermal springs in Kamena Vourla, elsewhere for the benefit of the people of Fthiotida. In the villages of the prefecture in Omvriaki, in other villages of Domokos we found ourselves on a tour of the typical start of this election period. From here in Lamia, together with our own people, we are entering the final stretch today. Into the last week of this great battle. Can we say it? No one else has shown the interest that the Communist, Greece has shown for Fthiotida and its people in this, especially in this election period. This interest is symbolized by my candidacy as head of the KKE's ballot paper in our prefecture. Today we can repeat with much greater certainty what we said several months ago that the KKE is entitled to be significantly strengthened, to have one of the four deputies in the prefecture of Fthiotida. In order to continue the struggle together for the good of our country, our homeland, with greater, more forces and all the messages say that this will happen in Fthiotida and throughout the country.
