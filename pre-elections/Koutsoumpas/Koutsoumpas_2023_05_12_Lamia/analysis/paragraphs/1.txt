Friends, compañeras and compañeros. I am very, very happy to be here once again. Here in my place in Lamia, the capital of Fthiotida. From here from Sterea from Roumeli we carry to every corner of Greece the call to support the KKE in the elections. So that our people will be stronger the next day. Yes, we can do it, we can be proud on election night. That can only happen in one way, with the decisive support of the KKE.
