Today the conditions have been scientifically formed for there to be a system of primary health care hospitals, fully staffed with all specialties and all modern means and not to have the hospital of Lamia operating with 60 fewer doctors than the organizational chart provides, apart from the other shortages in staff. Nor should we have the Health Centres under-operating with 2 and 3 general practitioners with shortages of nursing staff and with doctors transferred from the health centres to the hospital to cover the gaps.
