We informed them about the recent initiatives we took in Parliament, the submission of a series of amendments on the abolition of VAT on consumer goods, the abolition of the single consumption tax and VAT on energy, the reimbursement of the thirteenth and fourteenth pensions, but also on the freezing of freelancers' social security contributions for 2023, proposals that are immediate and realistic, but which the government of the New Democracy has refused to implement, as well as the opposition parties, SYRIZA, PASOK, who literally swallowed their tongue in the Parliament, we are not surprised that their attitude was the same throughout the previous period in the submission of a corresponding proposal for the reintegration of SMEs in the tax-free and the cancellation of debts to the tax authorities and banks, which were rejected by both the government of New Democracy and the government of SYRIZA before it. These are the champions of entrepreneurship. Of competitiveness, regardless of ideological colourings and individual differences. Much to the few and little to the many who are being asked to pay once again the marble of this capitalist development for it. And solidarity with the KKE for the great popular majority of professionals is now more imperative than ever.
