But the big announcement was made the next day by Mr Tsipras, who spoke in Piraeus. There he presented the legislative act that he says he has ready to file as soon as the government is formed. It contains three articles, not one article this time, so that the people will not remember their previous deceptions. So there it talks about cancelling all auctions of first homes. Not long ago, however, in the House of Commons he did not support Mr. E's amendment that provided for just that. How do you explain the contradiction? It is explained because this article has a follow-up article that is written against SYRIZA, until the plan we have presented for red loans is enacted. However, the one he boasts about ensures crazy profits of 30% for the crows, guaranteed with taxpayers' money, and which of course provides for regular auctions of first homes for those who cannot afford them, as is the case in every favoured country, as Mr Tsipras says.
