And because we've been hearing things these days about the government that will emerge after the elections. We say to you that the best thing for the people is that a government should emerge that feels the hot breath of the people of the working people's movement in every unpopular step it takes, and this can only happen with a very strong KKE. We know that I am a very strong KKE. On election Sunday, even people who may not have voted for us will smile, will feel won over. So take the step now. Make the surprise so that the joy of all our people will be even greater.
