Because our people have now accumulated enough experience to be able to discern what their real interests are. Who is with them and who is against them. Who will do after the election what they say during the election. Who will be at his side when the lights go out and the various illusory, costed and costed programmes of the parties that have ruled so far and brought us to the present unacceptable situation. Who has a programme and a proposal for the radical changes we need in order for us and our children to live as we deserve and can in the twenty-first century.
This can be seen even in their own polls and I am not talking so much about the rise of the KKE in the voting intention that all of them are now observing. There are other interesting findings, for example that the KKE is the most credible, or that it is garnering the overwhelmingly most positive votes of any party on this issue. Simply put, those who are considering voting for the Communist Party of Greece consider it the best choice for the people and the country, while those who are considering voting for the other parties do so half-heartedly with the familiar tried-and-true and completely failed logic of supposedly some lesser evil. But we must end with the lesser and greater evil is enough with New Democracy, Syriza, PASOK and all the evils of their fate. Let's choose the greater good this time. Let us go to the ballot box en masse, decisively with the KKE ballot paper.
