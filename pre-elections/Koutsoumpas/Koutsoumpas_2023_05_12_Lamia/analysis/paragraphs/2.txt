It is true that here in Fthiotida we have met again and again with the mass organizations of the people of the prefecture, of Fthiotida, with the unions of the workers of LARKO, the self-employed professionals, with the associations of farmers, with the health workers, with the committees of the flood victims. We listened and made their problems, their demands and their claims known throughout the country. We committed ourselves to fight with all our strength for them both in and out of Parliament and in the next Parliament. For example, we discussed with the representatives of the professionals of Lamia, of the very small businesses in the city, the problems they face, the effects of the price of energy and raw materials, and the debts that are piling up again. But also about the situation faced by a small business when its main provider, the people's family, is called upon day after day to cut back even on the basics in order to make ends meet.
