We knew what SYRIZA was, of course. But we also saw its very rapid transformation. We saw the credentials it presented to the various forums of capital, domestic and international, making it clear to them that it would not touch a hair of their interests. We saw the apparatchiks, the cadres of the then worn-out old PASOK, moving in an organised way to Syriza. We knew, of course, from our analysis and from historical experience that no government on the territory of this system, whatever its intentions, can pursue a policy that goes against the general interests of the exploiters of the people. These were mainly what kept us from stepping on the banana peel. We warned the people, we went against the current of that period, without taking into account the electoral costs, saying only great truths on the day that SYRIZA won the elections in January 2015, the radical wrote in its front page the New Democracy's memorandum is leaving, SYRIZA's memorandum is coming. On the day of the referendum fraud wrote their no is yes to a new memorandum. Who was finally verified? We all know it now all too well and we now see some Syriza ministers like Varoufakis who at the time were wagging their finger at us along with Mr Tsipras who sat on the same benches with the far right ANEL who participated in the deception asking for the vote of the people, pretending to be immaculate and untainted, after resigning they say in time after the referendum. Well, we don't have the memory of a goldfish. Then many working people, breadwinners under the pressure of the problems of impoverishing unemployment under the longing, itself for a change at least for a relief, wanted to make this test.
The path proposed to them by SYRIZA at the time seemed to them more direct, more realistic than the one proposed by the KKE. This is how SYRIZA got the vote of many honest left-wing, progressive, militant people.
