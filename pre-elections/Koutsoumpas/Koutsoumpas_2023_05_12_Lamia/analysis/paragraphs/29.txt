Today, therefore, you can be sure that the KKE does not talk, it is tried and tested, it is the sure choice to write new pages of great decisive struggles to count victories to strengthen solidarity and comradeship, to bring into the battle all the well-meaning people of toil, those whose hearts cannot bear the injustice, the KKE is the strength of the people, their hope made of the greatest materials of our history and our fighting traditions. For the KKE sees each and every one not just as a vote in a ballot box but as a fighter who together we will bring the world to the bosom of dreams in the bosom of people for our children, for generations to come. To stop all crime to dawn a world without wars, without barbarism, a world of peace in which our modern needs are matched by their gains and truly won. In this way we shall all together, all generations together, pave the way for the society we really need.
