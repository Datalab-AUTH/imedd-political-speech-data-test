Friends, compa√±eras and comrades, we believe that behind the pre-election cockfights of the parties that claim the first or even the second role in tomorrow's anti-people's government, what the KKE says has emerged more clearly in recent weeks is that the other parties share a common programme on the basic, major issues that will determine our lives after May 21 and for the years to come. This is increasingly being admitted by their own cadres who say that their differences are not as great as they are presented. We have now lost count of the relevant statements that leave open even the possibility of a New Democracy SYRIZA coalition government if that is required, have no doubt that these statements are not made in the absence of their leaders. Political massage and preparing the ground is called this for later and if these are said during the election, imagine what has to be done post-election. The foreign embassies, the various investment houses, the governor of the Bank of Greece himself admit it, all of them with one voice say that they are not worried about exactly what the composition of the next government will be, since whoever they say will do the job.
