Mr Tsipras and the SYRIZA cadres constantly refer to the KKE and say that after the elections the KKE should take responsibility. On whether we prefer a Syriza government with PASOK or whether we will open the way for Mitsotakis. Many times you will have heard us say that we are not in 2012 or 2015. It is true that 11 years have passed since those elections of May 2012, which, in the midst of a deep economic capitalist crisis, brought about major upheavals in the bourgeois political system, in the correlation of parties. At that time, New Democracy and PASOK were crushed and other parties, including SYRIZA, were strengthened. What SYRIZA started to say then in view of the next elections was that they would only cooperate with the KKE to make the government of the Left to vindicate the struggles of EAM and ELAS, to abolish the memoranda, to restore labour rights and even that they would open the way to socialism, they said, depending on the audience, of course. They even accused the KKE of not feeling its historical responsibility, of betraying the people and its history, and other such shameless things, but they caressed the ears of some honest people, democrats, leftists and militants.
