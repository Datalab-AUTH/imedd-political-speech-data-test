So now in 2023 and with all the experience that our people have accumulated during the pre-election period, SYRIZA has remembered the responsibilities of the KKE to support it in order to sit in the government chairs again. But we didn't. In 2012 and 2015 do they really think there's any chance of us doing them a favor now? To put our hands up and put our eyes out and take out the eyes of our people. Of course they don't believe that. The blackmail they are directing is not towards the JCP in general. It is in fact blackmail to the people themselves, the voters, blackmail to all and sundry who have taken notice of them and are thinking of abandoning them, and there are more than a few of them today. It shows above all the great difficulty they are encountering in really convincing the progressive people of this country, the workers, the youth, even those who voted for them in 2019, that they are a real alternative to the new democracy.
