Friends. Comrades, we saw that on Monday Mr Tsipras also visited our city. He even spoke here, next to the statue of Ares in the People's Square. It is a good thing he did not fall over to kick his ass. Of course, the truth is that SYRIZA is obsessed with statues. We saw it when it was a government that beat up students who were protesting at the statue of the butcher of the peoples of Truman in Athens. They didn't want, he says, to create a diplomatic incident with the US so they beat them up. But that's how it is with the statue of Veluhiotis during the election and after the election with the statue of Truman.  But that's who you are and we say to them.
