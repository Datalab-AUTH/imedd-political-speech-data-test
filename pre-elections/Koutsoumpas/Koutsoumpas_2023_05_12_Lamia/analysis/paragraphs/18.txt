Mr Tsipras, referring to the proverb that I said in the debate that he scratches on Chopani's goo. He called me a shepherd and that we see leftists as sheep.
First of all, if it was not and is not personal, it may be that Mr Tsipras Tsipras sees me as a shepherd, it may also be because of my Lamian origin, that I am from Fthiotida from Roumeli. We don't have a problem because we know that shepherds are straightforward, people are not hypocrites, they don't say one thing one day and another the next. As for who treats progressive people as sheep or puppies, let him look at himself in the mirror we say about this world. The one who once believed in him we have a very big hug because we fought with him in years past when he was passing memos and then again passing Mitsotakis' laws. We also know that many of them, many of you, are now thinking of voting for the KKE. So we call on you to close your ears to blackmail, to take the big step at the time of the ballot box. We are waiting for you next to us to walk together on the same road of honesty, to fight together the great battles that our people and our country need.
