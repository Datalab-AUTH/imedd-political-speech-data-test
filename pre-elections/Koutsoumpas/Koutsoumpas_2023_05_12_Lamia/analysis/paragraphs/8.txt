We are already seeing the results of this policy. 10.4 billion euros were in 2022 the net profits of only 150 business groups of those listed on the stock exchange, an increase of 303% compared to the previous year. But in the same period, real wages fell by 7.4%, according to the OECD, while the anti-labour laws that they have all passed over the last 15 years remain in force. And inflation, especially in food, continues to eat away at people's incomes. The OECD figures are wrong, Mr Mitsotakis told Mr Portosalte on SKAI the day before yesterday, and now he does not like the OECD, which Mr Mitsotakis advertises to us every now and then, the OECD's toolboxes, and soon he will tell us to disengage ourselves, as if the people's families were waiting for the OECD to tell them that they are entering the supermarket and their hearts are breaking.
