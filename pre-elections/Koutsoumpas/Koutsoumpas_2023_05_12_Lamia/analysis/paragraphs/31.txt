And you who still have hesitations, overcome them, keep the feeling you felt when you heard on Wednesday night that the Panhellenic is the first force and you saw that there is hope that the new generation brings with it. Just to feel that feeling again on 22 May is enough to throw the KKE ballot paper on the ballot box. And so do the surprise. And you who have already made up your minds, do your best. In the days that remain. Do not count on fatigue, as thousands of members or friends of the KKE all over Greece do not count on fatigue these days. Do everything you can to get our call everywhere, to put the KKE ballot paper in every people's home. Because only the people can save the people with KKE much stronger we move forward. We are moving forward strongly to lift our party as high as possible to make our people breathe, to open the way for the great, for the beautiful, for the shocking. Because we know better than anyone that to give up our dreams is madness, to change the world is neither madness nor utopia. It is justice. Good strength to all, good health, good struggles, KKE strong. Hope is here.
