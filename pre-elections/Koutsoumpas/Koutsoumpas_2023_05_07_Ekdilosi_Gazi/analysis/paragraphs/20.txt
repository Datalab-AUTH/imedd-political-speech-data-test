Friends, there is a way out. We firmly believe that surely there can be again, a higher organisation of society, where land, water, housing, fuel, energy, energy, labour power itself, are not commodities. There was the Soviet Union in the last century, where, for example, social rights to work, to housing, to heating, to health, to education of a high standard were guaranteed in practice. There were countries where socialism was built, where no one was homeless and no one suffered from the cold, despite the harsh winter. Where there was no insecurity about 'what would happen if I got fired'. Where there were large open spaces and huge green parks in the cities. Where students were not concerned about the problem of housing and their education was truly free. Where traffic did not stop at the first heavy rain and the first snow. Where the state apparatus could evacuate entire cities within hours when a major accident of great magnitude occurred.There were guaranteed rights that capitalism cannot and will not guarantee, no matter how many decades pass. After all, humanity has known it for 500 years now, since it began to replace the previous social system, feudalism.We can imagine today, in the 21st century, the radical improvement that socialism can bring to our lives. We can more easily document the radical improvement that central scientific planning will bring, driven by social well-being rather than by securing capitalist profit. On the ground of social ownership of land, water and the means of production, modern safe housing, urban renewal and expansion, and overall land use will be planned with the whole of the people's needs in mind. With the daily active role of the workers in making and controlling decisions.
