Friends, What does all the above prove?That the "tsunami" of auctions and losses of family property will continue, after the elections, whatever government is formed. That the people's homes can only be saved by the popular uprising and that is why a strong KKE is needed to organise the popular counter-attack. This state appears incapable of protecting the first home and securing our right to housing. All governments appear incapable of ensuring civil protection so that we stop burning in the summer and drowning in the winter!In fact, the state and its governments are too capable of ensuring the profits of the conglomerates and for the same reason they sacrifice our needs. The present state is hostile to us because it is the state of the dictatorship of capital. And this does not only concern the most obvious aspects, such as the undermining of strikes and the repression of demonstrations. It is about all aspects of our lives.
