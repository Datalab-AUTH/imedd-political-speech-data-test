We have a plan for today and tomorrow. And of course we are not waiting passively for a great day to dawn to implement it.The forces of the KKE are stepping forward today to organize a great popular counter-offensive that will open the road to subversion. We are stepping forward to prevent homes from being left without electricity and to prevent the auctions of first homes. Our action inspires and helps popular families to stand up and reach out to their neighbors, to working people as a whole, to break the climate of fear and passivity. "Fear nothing and no one," says a resident whose house is currently threatened for auction after a militant initiative spearheaded by the KKE. We are agitating that "the houses of the people can ultimately only be saved by the popular uprising, saved by the people, with their solidarity and struggle". We fight daily against the robbery of the workers' and people's income. We call on the people to turn their backs on the blackmailing and deceptive dilemmas. Not to choose between losing their homes or losing what they have and keeping what they don't have. Not to choose whether the auctions and the out-of-court settlements will become a law of the ND or SYRIZA government, but to fight with the KKE for the real abolition of house auctions and the cancellation of a large part of the debt of wage earners and the self-employed!
