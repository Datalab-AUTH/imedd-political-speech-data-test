Friends. If one wants to reveal how phony, how false the electoral confrontation of the parties of the system is, surely the issue of people's housing is one of the most characteristic. On the eve of the elections, all the accomplices in the crimes of auctions and household over-indebtedness are now posing as the late protectors of the first home; we, for our part, are clearly telling the wage-earners and the self-employed that it is time to pay up. They should think about how we got here, who is responsible, who has benefited and what is coming next. They should think about who told the truth and who is constantly trying to deceive them.
