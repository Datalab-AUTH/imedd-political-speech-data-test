These are not our assertions, these are analyses of the KKE. The new Eurostat report on housing in Europe accepts this. What does the report reflect? That more than 32% of the urban population, that is, of the urban dwellers in Greece, are overburdened by housing costs. What does excessive mean? That they are forced to spend more than 40% of their income to cover their housing costs. The percentage of Greek households already in arrears and struggling to pay bills, rents and loans is more than 36%! This is well above the EU average.
