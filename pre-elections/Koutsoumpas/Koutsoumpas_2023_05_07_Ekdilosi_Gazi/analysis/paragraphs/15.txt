It is the workers who create all social wealth. They have the right to live in the city centres, in the areas around the Acropolis, on the seafront, everywhere. The workers are not beggars, to be fed by the Food Bank, to take medicine from the Old Medicine Bank, to live in the buildings of the Land Bank! The storm of foreclosures and the bleeding of borrowers, with the threat of foreclosures, is not an accidental choice. It is certainly imposed by Greece's commitments to the EU, which are constantly reflected in the post-monetary surveillance reports from 2019 to date and require the full liberalisation of first home auctions. Commitments that none of the parties in the system is questioning; it is promoted by the state that has given billions of euros in guarantees (from our own bleeding, of working taxpayers) to support domestic banking groups through the Hercules program and wants to get rid of the burden of "red" loans. It is demanded by the banking conglomerates, who do not risk making mortgage loans without the guarantee provided by foreclosures and mortgages! It is promoted by the 'crows', funds and servicers, who hold most of the 'red' loans. That is why the New Democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA have again rejected the proposal of the KKE to write off a large part of the debt of over-indebted popular households and to ban the auctions of first homes. That is why they all support the National Regulatory Framework for the Management of Arrears, which ultimately forces "cooperative" borrowers to lose their property and "uncooperative" borrowers to lose their homes. That is why they are also drowning in the contradictions of their policy, which is constantly generating new 'red' loans.
