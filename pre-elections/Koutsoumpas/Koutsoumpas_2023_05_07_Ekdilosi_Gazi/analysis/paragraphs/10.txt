SYRIZA criticized at the time the basic provision of the Katseli law, that in order to support the first home, the borrower had to have and sell the rest of his assets. That is why SYRIZA stressed that of the 430,000 "red" loans, only 170,000 of the 430,000 "red" loans used the provisions of the law through appeals. Then, all parties of the system, SYRIZA, ND and PASOK, voted for the sale of "red" loans to funds, in order to ensure the competitiveness and profits of the banks and conglomerates and the interests of the lenders.
In the two years 2015 - 2017, the SYRIZA - ANEL government voted successively for the sale of "red" loans to funds, the implementation of electronic auctions and the "peculiar" for those who resist the auctions. The 'red' loans that have passed into the ownership of the funds amount to more than â‚¬85 billion. While 600,000 properties have been given as collateral as security for these loans. Of these, around 50% are mortgaged houses. On the online platform, since 2019, auctions have been posted on the online platform, averaging more than 25,000 per year. In fact, they soared to over 52,000 in 2022. Of course, not all auctions are completed immediately, the homes transferred are fewer. But the auction tsunami did not start now.
