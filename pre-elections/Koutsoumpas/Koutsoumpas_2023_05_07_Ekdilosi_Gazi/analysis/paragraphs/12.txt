Friends, SYRIZA is criticizing the New Democracy government for having ostensibly overturned, during its days, the pro-people's framework that it supposedly had. It claims that the auctions of first homes have just been liberalised. But the truth is that until now, auctions could be carried out directly by the funds and tens of thousands of such auctions were carried out.
The Supreme Court's decision merely made it legally easier for the new 'crows' who help the biggest 'predators', the fund management companies, the servicers. The role of these companies is already provided for in Law 4354/2015 passed by the SYRIZA government.SYRIZA also claims that only the ND government ensures tax relief for funds and servicers...
Because it provides for loan transfers under the older law of 2023, not 2015. The truth of course, is that both laws, provide tax exemptions for stamp duties and registration fees in the public registers and tax, in essence, the income from loan management in the same way. The 2015 Law also explicitly provides that funds may be domiciled in any non-EU country. Finally, SYRIZA claims that its own framework shielded the borrower in the case of the first home... But it is not telling the truth on this either. SYRIZA's law introduced the term "uncooperative borrower" which should not be protected!!! This is also how the competent governmental directorate formed by the Stathakis Law, i.e. the Special Secretariat for the Management of Private Debt, defined which are considered as "most vulnerable households" and which are considered as "reasonable living expenses".
