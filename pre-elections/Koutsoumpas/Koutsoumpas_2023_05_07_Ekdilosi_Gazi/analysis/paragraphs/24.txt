Friends, Compañeras and Compañeros, With these thoughts, I wish you good strength and health, good luck in our struggle.
By presenting our positions on the issue of people's housing and the protection of people's housing today, we contribute as a party to make the final straight to the elections more meaningful than the cockfights, false dilemmas, blackmail and chic confrontations between the parties that are mainly responsible for the current tragic situation.In the elections of May 21, we fight to make the KKE even stronger, so that the people themselves are strong!
