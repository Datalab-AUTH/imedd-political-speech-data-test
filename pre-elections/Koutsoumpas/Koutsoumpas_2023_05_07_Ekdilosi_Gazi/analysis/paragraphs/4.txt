Why were the people's households burdened with so many debts to the state, to the tax authorities, to the social security funds, to the banks? Why so many red mortgages? Why are they unable to pay their rents and bills?The answer lies in the massacre of the people's income implemented by all governments, the current and previous ones, which bleeds the people to fulfil the goals of capital and the commitments of the EU. The answer lies in the policy of memoranda and post-memorandum commitments promoted and implemented together, hand in hand, by the ND, SYRIZA and PASOK. This is why tax debtors alone exceeded 4 million under the SYRIZA government and are increasing under the ND government. This is also why the home ownership rate is steadily falling in Greece from 84% in 2005 to 73% today. The policy that cut wages and pensions, demolished insurance rights, increased unjust indirect taxes and the tax burden of the people, brought popular households to this situation. The policy of bloody surpluses has brought the people to their knees.
