SYRIZA tries to show the problem in the alleged "non-engagement" of the creditors rather than seeing the settlement procedures themselves! According to him, everything is the fault of some "speculators", excessive profit... Thus, he brings back the reheated soup, that the alleged "regulated" profit... of the banks will address this serious problem! He claims that the "binding nature of the regulations" and their reasoned rejection by the banks will improve the situation, for the benefit of the workers! Divestment of other assets and maximum squeezing of the over-indebted popular households! At the same time, SYRIZA presents a supposedly "radical" and comprehensive housing policy programme, with which it claims it will tackle the problem of people's housing!What does its programme provide for? In fact, it proposes the state subsidy to those big landlords who have vacant, unused buildings and their conversion into housing complexes!In simpler words, it proposes the imprisonment of young and poor people's families in areas where they do not want to live, and at the same time, it proposes state support to the banks and big capital that owns these properties... Which, in order to renovate them, it proposes state-guaranteed rents and tax exemptions. Hey, no Mr. Tsipras! The poor people, the working classes, are not second-class people, as you probably understand them. They do not want to live in the Land Bank, where the wealthy do not live, where the tourist capital does not want to live, where there is no economic interest from business.
