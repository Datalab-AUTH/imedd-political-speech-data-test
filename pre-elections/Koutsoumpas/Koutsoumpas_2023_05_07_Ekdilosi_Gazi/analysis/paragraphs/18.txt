There is no need to go into detail about the rehabilitation of the earthquake victims. It is constantly spoken by the lively protests of their committees about the unjustified delays throughout Greece.
However, while the needs are swelling, the relevant state agencies are being downgraded, depleted of staff and discredited. Only 51% of municipalities have competent building services, even on paper. Of the 168 Building Services (SBS), 22 do not have a single qualified engineer, and some do not actually have any staff. At the same time, vast amounts of Community funds are being allocated for the energy upgrading of buildings whose structural adequacy is not guaranteed. Buildings that no one can guarantee will withstand the next big earthquake. What is the explanation for all this? Once again, it is to ensure maximum profit for the conglomerates. This is the main criterion for prioritising and selecting funding for projects.For the same reason, integrated seismic planning based on social needs cannot be implemented today. Planning with long-term measures for the prevention of seismic effects and state protection of structures, as well as immediate performance measures. We are told, of course, that the economy cannot cope with the cancellation of debts and interest for the people's households, nor with large increases in wages and pensions, nor with large expenditure on civil protection. Curiously, however, it can afford to pay the big groups less than 6% of annual tax revenues. The state can afford to guarantee the conglomerates billions of euros through development laws, tax exemptions and state participation in Community programmes!
