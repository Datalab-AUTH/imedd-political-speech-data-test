Revenues in the Greek market reached 2.2 billion euros this year, up from 1.4 billion euros in 2019. The abolition after 2012 of the OEK exacerbates the problem even more. More generally, the onslaught of tourism in city centres, not only in the form of airbnb, is also drastically changing land prices. Entire areas are being transformed into hotbeds of tourist interest. Tourist-oriented hotels and entertainment centres are springing up like mushrooms, driving up land prices. The redevelopment of city centres, the 'grand promenade', has precisely this aim. To turn cities into areas of tourist interest.Similarly, the changes in holiday construction are made to concentrate land in the hands of the tourism groups. Last November, tens of thousands of small landowners suddenly saw the abolition of building by derogation make them the pawns of big investors. Now, the way is opening up (with the de facto abolition of the 4-acre requirement for a large piece of land) for the massive concentration of land in large conglomerates.
We recall, that under the state policy promoted by ND and SYRIZA, large conglomerates are exempted from any zoning restrictions. They build hotels wherever they want with preferential conditions. In other words, the housing crisis in Greece is not only about the nightmare of foreclosures.
