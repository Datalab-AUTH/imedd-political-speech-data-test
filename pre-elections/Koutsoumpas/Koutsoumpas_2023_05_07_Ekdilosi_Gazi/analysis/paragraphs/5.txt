SYRIZA hypocritically said that it was forced by the Brussels priesthood to follow this policy. But recently, SYRIZA MPs were standing up to applaud Tsipras in Parliament, when he declared himself proud of having secured the notorious cushion for the Greek economy, i.e. the bloody surplus of the 2015-2019 SYRIZA government. Now the OECD says in its recommendations for the next government that a new bloody surplus will be required to ensure Greece's investment grade and to make the country attractive for new investments by domestic and foreign groups.The EU is making similar demands for the disbursement of the Community funds. In other words, the unpopular policy will continue and intensify, no matter which government is formed.
