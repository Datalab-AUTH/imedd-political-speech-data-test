Not to choose between the rent subsidy of Syriza or the mortgage subsidy of ND, since in both cases they will end up paying more. On the one hand as a taxpayer for the state subsidies and on the other hand from the constant increase in rents and interest on the loans. To fight with the KKE for the only way out that truly secures the right of the people to modern and secure housing. The forces of the KKE will be at the forefront of organising the struggle of the people, against the hardships ahead, against the new anti-people's measures that the next government will implement, whatever colour or sign it uses. We will be in front, as the only real popular opposition, inside and outside the Parliament, to meet the housing needs of the people under the responsibility of the state. We are ahead in the struggle:
- To abolish the auctions of the people's homes and property.
- To abolish indirect taxes on fuel and basic necessities.
- For the re-establishment of the OEK, the use of its reserves and real estate, the strengthening of an exclusively state-run construction programme, for modern and cheap houses for working families.
- For the use of the real estate of the EFKA for the needs of the people and not for the projects of the special purpose company.
- For interest-free housing loans to eligible workers and the unemployed.
- For the utilisation of hotels and apartments for free student housing under the responsibility of the state.
- For comprehensive state planning for earthquake and flood protection.
- For anti-seismic control of public housing under the responsibility of the state, against compulsory private building insurance.
- For the abolition of Concession Contracts and PPPs that burden us with very expensive tolls and new burdens so that a handful of conglomerates can make a fortune.
- For cheap electricity and water for the people, against the commitments of the EU's Green Transition.
- For the protection of the people's income, for Collective Agreements with substantial increases, 35-hour - 5-day - 7-hour, for the cancellation of interest and part of the debts.
