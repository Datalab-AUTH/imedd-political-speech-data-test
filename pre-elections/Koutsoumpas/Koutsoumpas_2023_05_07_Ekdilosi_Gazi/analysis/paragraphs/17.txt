Let's look, for example, at the appalling deficit in our country's seismic shielding. The government, after the recent major earthquakes in Turkey, initially tried to create a climate of complacency, arguing that modern seismic regulations are applied in Greece, but the truth is that more than 50% of the buildings are constructed without any seismic regulations or with the old 1959 seismic regulations. The last substantial revision of the New Greek Seismic Regulation was made in 2000 and 2003. Accurate data on the public buildings that have been inspected, in first, second and third degree, have not been made public recently; not even accurate data on schools and hospitals in each administrative region. According to the Earthquake Planning and Protection Agency itself, 16,000 operational public buildings of immediate concern remain without pre-seismic testing. Local government facilities and state agencies remain without inspection.Everyone also acknowledges the erosion of reinforcement in many old "tired buildings" and the urgent need to take action.But the current government, like previous ones, is promoting as an individual responsibility of residents to take on the responsibility and financial burdens of inspecting buildings and homes.And it is promoting as a solution compulsory private home insurance, along the lines of France and Germany. Consider that, without adding these burdens, the current cost of issuing an electronic identity card for a building starts at 600 euros and can reach 4,000 euros if the file needs to be reconstructed due to loss of permits!
