In 2020, the government of the New Democracy, with the new Bankruptcy Code, untied the hands of the creditors to seize and sell off a large part of the property of those who cannot afford to service their loans. In February 2023, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the Management Companies, the servicers, who have taken over the affairs of the funds, to take legal actions themselves involving auctions. A decision that proved, among other things, what the representatives of the capital mean when they call for the judiciary to become a "source of confidence" for investments. The new programme of the Southwest for 'housing for the young' also has the same character: The support of banks and construction capital. What does the programme provide for? State-subsidized loans, which banks will give to young workers to buy property, much of which is owned by banks and construction capital. The new workers will turn into the new borrowers - with state-guaranteed loans - this time, and will wait for the next crisis and the collapse of their wages, only to then turn into the next period's over-indebted too. And yet, the limits and conditions imposed end up excluding the most vulnerable, while pushing young people into areas far from where they wish to live. The real beneficiary of the scheme is again the banks... The banks, who will make thousands of new and multi-secured loans from a thousand sides, while getting rid of properties that currently remain unsold.
