The KKE warned the people in time, stepped forward in the struggle and illuminated the truth with facts and figures. The communists through their unions are in front of every battle to prevent the electricity from being cut off in people's houses, to prevent people's families from being forced out by the auctions.And this is recognized by many people who say that they have found in the communists new friends in the face of their suffering. The truth is that the cost of housing is unbearable for a large part of people's families. If you add in utilities and other bills, it takes the better part of an average salary to make it through the month.
