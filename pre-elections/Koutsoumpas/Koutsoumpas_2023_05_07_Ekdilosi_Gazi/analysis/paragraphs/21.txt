There will be a balanced development of construction to meet the needs of housing, infrastructure projects, support for industrial and agricultural production. Human-friendly cities will be formed, with sufficient green lungs and zones of popular sports and cultural activity. Integrated plans will be implemented for the management of water resources, waste and civil protection, with the development of modern standards and regulations. More generally, spatial planning will be based on scientific research to diagnose new social needs. All this can be done immediately, as soon as the people realise their power and decide to walk the path of subversion, hand in hand with other peoples. And the power of the people is proven in all cases: From the villages saved from the fires in Evia, in the Peloponnese, in Mytilene, to the great wave of solidarity with the peoples of Syria and Turkey after the recent earthquakes. This supremacy of the new society of socialism, to provide a radical solution to the question of housing and other popular problems, is illuminated by the contemporary subversive power programme of the KKE.
