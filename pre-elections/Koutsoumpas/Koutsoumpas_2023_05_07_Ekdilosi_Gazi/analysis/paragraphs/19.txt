The big construction groups are literally getting rich with the support of the state: Through concession contracts, PPPs, preferential terms for the tendering of large projects, even with bonuses of tens of millions of euros when they are not late in implementing their contractual obligations. But do all of us, the employed and self-employed, tenants and those who are struggling to repay their mortgages, really have any reason to continue on the path that has brought us to our current situation? We must and can think in terms of the experience we have accumulated over the years, in terms of what life itself has taught us. And life proves time and again that the class bias of government policy is always determined by the needs of capital and the steely laws of profit. Life proves that no matter how many governments change, the train of bourgeois governance is and will continue to move firmly on the tracks set by the ruling class and the EU's commitments. Let us consider that the current, dead-end road for us is not, after all, a one-way street as it is presented to us. To think outside the blinders, outside the walls of the current rotten system. We argue that there is a way out, socialism!
