The increase in rents, mortgage interest and taxes in recent years completes this nightmare scenario, which plunges popular households into uncertainty and despair. And these increases are not going to stop, they will continue. The ECB has already proceeded to raise the base rate by 4% in a year, in order to curb the galloping inflation in the Eurozone. To curb inflation, which the EU's own policy in the previous period increased by borrowing to provide large state packages to support its conglomerates and manage the crisis. It has been shown once again that any medicine for one symptom of the great patient, capitalism, becomes a poison for the other. There is no magic formula for the pro-popular transformation of a rotting system. The increase in the ECB interest rate, among other things, leads to a constant increase in mortgage rates. Thus, from 1.5% in 2021, the interest rate on a mortgage loan could exceed 4.5% this year.
