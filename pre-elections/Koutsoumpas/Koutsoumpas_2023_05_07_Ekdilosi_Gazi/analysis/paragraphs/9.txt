In particular, on the crime of auctions itself, we are witnessing a recital of hypocrisy and deception by ND, SYRIZA and PASOK. Together they all want to hide the fact that auctions will continue and increase after the elections, no matter which government is formed. Their phony confrontation tries to cover up the fact that they are all complicit in the crime, that they all together shaped and imposed the reactionary framework that puts the noose around the people's necks. So let's see what the truth is and how we got here.
The original law that was supposed to protect the first home during the era of the memoranda was the Katseli law of the PASOK government. The former PASOK minister herself has explained the benefits for the banks of this law. She has stated that it initially preserved the value of the properties in the domestic banks' portfolios, which would have collapsed if all the auctions had proceeded massively and abruptly, and that at the same time the banks secured a large part of the loan repayments.
