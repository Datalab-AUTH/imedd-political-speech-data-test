What does this mean? An increase in the monthly instalment of more than 130 euros and an additional charge of 200 euros for mortgages of 100,000 euros. The temporary cap on the interest increase set by the government does not negate the great deterioration of the situation. Already a large proportion of the red loans that had been settled and related to the banks' portfolio are already being reopened. Add to this the unbearable state taxation and a significant portion has effectively become tenants in their own home. At the same time a new round of rent increases is coming, which have already taken off over the last six years. In Attica alone, according to the latest surveys, the increase in rental prices since 2017 has averaged 35%. And while people's incomes are falling, rent prices will rise even more. In addition to inflation and increased demand, the new increase in rents is being driven by the ability of many landlords to make a quick profit from Airbnb-style rentals for apartments. In 4 years, the average price per night for short-term residential rentals has increased by 35%.
