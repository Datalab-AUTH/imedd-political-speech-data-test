Besides, Velopoulos himself knows all about this and he had given his vote before the government. Remember New Democracy Pasok LAOS and then supported as a member of New Democracy its governance from 2012 to 15. An anachronistic formation that is now bringing out all its reactionary positions. May it win a few more Nazi votes. Let the people send them all to hell. Thessaloniki in particular knows well the criminal role of the fascist orphans of Golden Dawn. The people and the youth crushed them and sent them to the dustbin. Especially here we are proud because the KKE, when some people were silent, when some people kept equal distances and reproduced the theory of two extremes, when some people applauded the Nazis of Azov, when some people did not dare to fight the fascist monster that surrounded the EPALs in Stavroupoli and Evosmos, the KKE was there, the KNE was there. You would face the comments in the neighborhoods. He crushed them along with the people. He made them run like rabbits to hide in their burrows. Our people will need such Nazi kittens of the system feeding racism, intolerance, hatred of organized struggle on demand, openly supported directly by some big businessmen to lead the system down painless paths but dangerous for the people. Our people must speak again. To send once and for all the crypto Nazi far-rightists who came out in this election, send them all home. After all, it has been proven once again that this state is neither willing nor able to take them on.
