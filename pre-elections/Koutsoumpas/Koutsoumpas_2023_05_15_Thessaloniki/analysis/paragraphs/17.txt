These and many other things are what the KKE is fighting for.These are its political proposal, its programme for the power of the people themselves. The KKE has the only real pro-people's proposal for government. The only proposal that is realistic and feasible because it does not depend either on the medium-term, according to the European Union's preconditions. The programme of the KKE depends only on the strength and the will of the people and this is powerful, it can achieve what it needs and deserves. Because it is the people, the working class who move society. But we are not simply waiting for the moment when this programme of ours will be implemented. We are making these proposals with our daily struggle. Moreover, now we are not passively waiting for the governmental positions in this power of the people, but we are now assuming our responsibilities, we are stepping forward by carrying on our shoulders the heaviest responsibilities. Those of the organisation, the demands of the workers, the class struggle, the struggle against the employers' terror, the state repression. And these are the greatest responsibilities that we can take on today - our people need us now.
