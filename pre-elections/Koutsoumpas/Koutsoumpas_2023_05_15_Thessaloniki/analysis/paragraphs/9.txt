Throughout the whole election period, it has been proven by the species or the lips of the new democracy of SYRIZA, PASOK, that the next government will not change the unpopular rails. It is not only the statements of their executives from Mrs Tsapanidou and Mrs Bakoyannis, who say that in the important New Democracy-SYRIZA have no differences, up to Mr Apostolakis who did not rule out a grand coalition of all of them or the most experienced in cooperation governments, Mr Venizelos, Mr Christodoulakis, who talk about the impressive convergence of the programs of these three parties for a feasible cooperation between them. More than anything, however, it is the unpopular programme to which they are all signing up together and they make no secret of the fact that this is what they will be implementing for the next four years, however much they try to muddy the waters with proposals that they try to present as attractive to the people and to the workers. Unless a worker can consider as promising the prospect of waiting until 2027, so that his salary, after many ifs, will perhaps reach 2011 levels, as promised by Mitsotakis, or to believe that there is a prospect for the people's family, the proposal to secure the interests of the crow funds. With reasonable profits it says through the axe of reasonable living expenses that Syriza says, none of this is promising for the people. The next government's programme includes over 350 unpopular preconditions up to 2025 for the European Union's recovery fund. The ultramemorandum, this as it is in reality of the New Democracy of SYRIZA and PASOK.
