So you can see what is coming and that is why we need a strong KKE to face this situation, especially as there are increasing signs that there will be a slowdown in the capitalist economy. A new crisis with the cannons in the banks going off in succession that they themselves say. That they need to move to a more restrictive policy to deal with a new crisis that is just around the corner internationally and that our people have experienced in a very bitter way. What awaits them when they hear all this. Will those who are paying for their own capitalist development pay again? After all, this is not the first time that a new crisis is about to succeed the recovery. The big fat talk of growth throughout the 2000s was paid for by the people with the unpopular torrent of the memoranda then and the other measures. From 2010 onwards, but the growth they had promoted as the Promised Land for our people in the previous five years, all of them turned out to be hell for the people. One gives him from one pocket 2 steals from the other through inflation through inflation through accuracy in popular consumer goods through tax evasion. But there is no more endurance so far no more bleeding the people in every way so that a handful of drones can win. The people see the same play being played out before their eyes with the same kind of protagonists every time.
