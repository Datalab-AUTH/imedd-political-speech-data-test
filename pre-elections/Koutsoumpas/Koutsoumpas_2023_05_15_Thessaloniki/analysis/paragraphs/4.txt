There is a people now much more experienced who have been spoon-fed the false hopes are now widely known pro-popular management of an inhuman barbaric System cannot exist. The very history of such governments has proven this in the result of the recent SYRIZA government, which after having collaborated with the extreme right-wing ANEL from the very beginning, then brought the people the third and worst memorandum and they are back to the scene of the crime again. Because their candidate here in Thessaloniki said that it is not unlikely that Tsipras and Velopoulos will work together, as they worked with Kammenos before. This is also proven by the so-called progressive governments all over Europe that they have and for example their scarecrow; unless they think it is progressive to keep wages at 2011 levels. Crushing the people in taxes, at the same time exempting shipowners to strike the right to strike, chasing the unpopular preconditions of the European Union, bounty hunting to the US-NATO hawks and so much more. And then it annoys them that we tell them that their progress is phony, it's muff. Now it's time for the conclusion that the KKE was right not to get its hands dirty in an unpopular government to be turned by all and sundry into a common march and a vote for the KKE.
