But how can you be in touch with the problems of the people when such a distance separates you from all this, no matter how much nonsense they say, it cannot be hidden that everywhere our people are constantly confronted with the same contradiction, that there are millions of workers who, with their work, their knowledge, with their knowledge, their skills, they produce all the wealth of this country, there are workers capable of producing, of creating with high qualification and ability, but not exploited in their industry, a new generation that comes with momentum and struggles for its education, with an appetite to create and grow, to exploit the new technologies and what humanity has produced, and on the other side there are a handful of people and their governments, who are trying to limit all this power, to put the brakes on it, to subjugate it within the framework of their own profit, who see the workers only as some necessary parts and tools to achieve their coveted capitalist profits, who see the rights of our people as an obstacle to their profits. On the one hand, there are a handful of people and their representatives who speak a wooden, incomprehensible language about fiscal rules, about competitiveness, about eligible half-spending for budgetary margins.
