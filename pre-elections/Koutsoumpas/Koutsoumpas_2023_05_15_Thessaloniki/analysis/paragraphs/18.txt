Friends. Against the pieces that have brought us to this point. Neither blind indignation nor painless choices for various so-called small parties will suffice. After all, there is plenty of experience of them too, and they are doing the work of putting small parties for all tastes on the street in order to grab the youth vote in particular again in an oblique way and drive it back to the big parties. Parties that are made and disbanded overnight after they have played their part persons from shooting stars to caricature faces and reheated food. All of them, with the aim, first, to divide the vote of the Greek people here and there in harmless paths and then to grab it, dissolve and diffuse them into a new democracy and SYRIZA. Even the most recent of these, Day 25, has been left with only 6 MPs, after the rest either went independent or ended up in SYRIZA. and let Mr Varoufakis now tear his clothes off during the pre-election that he will not cooperate. And it is logical since these parties have the same strategy, which is why they are both communicating vessels and the form of the Greek solution. Are they not a reactionary patchwork of temporarily disillusioned neo-democrats who are ready to cast their votes for a more right-wing government?
