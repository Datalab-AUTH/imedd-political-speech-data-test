Well, our people have this great opportunity this year to shake up everything that makes them feel these scoundrels are fixed, to catch them in their anxiety. The cold sweat on election night with very high KKE turnouts and with many young militants with young communist MPs on the KKE ballot papers. Attack more, burn the cards up their sleeves. So let's have a much stronger KKE together with the people to confront them, so that the next anti-people's measures they plan to pass cannot be easily passed, so that the organized struggle nationwide can be strengthened to claim all that our people deserve in the twenty-first century. To intensify the conflict with the whole policy, the strategy of this system that wants our people in the corner. So we can truly hope for better days. The vote for the KKE will not just stay in the ballot box, it will be directly cast in the struggles for the right of the people. It will strengthen the people themselves. It will immediately, without waiting, strengthen its struggle, the dynamic opposition to the next government.
