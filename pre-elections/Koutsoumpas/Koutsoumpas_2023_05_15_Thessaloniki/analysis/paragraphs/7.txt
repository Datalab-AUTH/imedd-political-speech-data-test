Because also further stability in our region as a whole and in the Aegean Sea in particular requires painful agreements and constant engagement in new dangers for our people. And while we are talking and talking about the Aegean? The result of the elections in Turkey does not lead to a change of strategic direction and policy, because the programs of the two gladiators there, Erdogan and the alliance led by KilÄ±njaroglu, are in the service of the big capital of the Turkish monopolies against the working class and the people of Turkey, who are facing many acute problems there as well. Let there be no doubt. The new Presidency in Turkey after 28 May, which is the second round, will continue the course within NATO and will attempt to strike a balance between the United States of America and Russia. It will fulfil its own role in the imperialist rivalries. The main element of foreign policy will remain the goal of geopolitical upgrading and the promotion of the interests of the Turkish ruling class in competition with the Greek, i.e. the familiar path of challenging the sovereignty and sovereign rights of the Greek islands. And all this in the direction of all-out negotiations. For the co-exploitation of the Aegean with the intervention of the USA, NATO, the European Union. That is why our people must be vigilant. The NATO Prespa Agreement of SYRIZA has contributed to these dangers, which are becoming more and more dangerous for the Balkans, which are still boiling, and that is why the whole city of Thessaloniki has become a stable base for the US-NATO troops from end to end in the last few days. From the port to the airport and all the city's camps have been counted on, but without the hotelier, the people of Thessaloniki know well enough to send them either to the market or to the sea if necessary. As he did so bravely last year at the port.
