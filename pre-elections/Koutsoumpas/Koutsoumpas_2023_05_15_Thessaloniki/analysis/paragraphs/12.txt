Friends. Let us consider 10.4 billion euros in 2022, the net profit of only 150 listed business groups, an increase of 303% compared to the previous year. In the same period the real wage. It decreased as a result of their laws that they have all passed in the last 15 years and these laws remain in force, combined of course with the huge inflation and they have the audacity to ask our people, Mr Mitsotakis says a chance to govern for the first time without national use and difficulties, and Mr Tsipras says a chance to govern for the first time without a memorandum. And some others have the greatest audacity to want our people to believe that this huge contradiction will be solved by harmless wisecracks of different applications for transactions in technocratic ways, as Mr Varoufakis proposes, as if the problem is the way in which transactions are made and not how much money you have to make them. And the people's money is running out barely halfway through each month.
