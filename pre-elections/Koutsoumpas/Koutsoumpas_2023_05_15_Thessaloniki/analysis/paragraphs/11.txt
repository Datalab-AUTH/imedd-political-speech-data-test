So now, strong JCE. So that we can fight these battles from better positions. To prevent them from squeezing out victories, to finally pave the way for the radical changes we all long for. Because now we know better than ever. That only the people save the people when they take the road of conflict, the road of subversion. We proved it in the pandemic and in the great struggles. To save human lives, to support the hospitals and their staff. We proved it in the fires, in the floods, in earthquakes, in the great workers' struggles, such as in COSCO, in the e-food couriers, in the heroic Malamatina workers who did not bend with the support of all the people. And so many other struggles across the country. Now this slogan takes on a new meaning. The people should massively support their party, the KKE.
