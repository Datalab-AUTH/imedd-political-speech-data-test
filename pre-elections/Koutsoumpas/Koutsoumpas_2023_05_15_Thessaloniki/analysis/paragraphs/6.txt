Friends, compañeras and compañeros. From the very first moment, the KKE exposed the attempt to blackmail the people with the dilemmas of stability. We immediately told the people the truth. Their stability presupposes constant instability in our lives, because stable development requires a constant axing of workers' and people's rights by them. This is why workers, while hearing about growth, see themselves working more and more and getting paid for fewer and fewer hours, because a steady rise in profits requires a steady wage fix for them. That is, after all, how their profits are built. This system has a way of devouring even the small, meager increases it gives. That is why the average wage has been reduced by 25% since 2011, not to mention the infamous tourist miracle and the wages of young children who are preparing here in the region to go to sweatshop businesses in Halkidiki and elsewhere. Because their stable environment for investment requires a crushing of workers' organisation. Strike action, limiting the action of the unions of demands because their stable prospects for new fields of profitability require that health, education but also water, energy and so much more be steadily transformed into expensive commodities. This is what happened in Thessaloniki with the E Y A i with the joint signature of New Democracy SYRIZA PASOK got their answer but from thousands of people in a shocking concert demonstration here.
