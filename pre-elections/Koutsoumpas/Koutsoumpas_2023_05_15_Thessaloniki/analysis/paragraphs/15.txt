Alone. They on the one hand with their profits and losses with their paper pushers and their political representatives, steeped in corruption and scandals, sawing each other's chair and watching each other. And all of us on the other hand who are fighting the daily struggle of dignity and survival, who fight every day every hour to keep our family standing, who have nothing but our minds and hands but who have in each other and all of us the power of the world to change this society. So alone then and all of us. And the many will win with a strong, powerful Mr. Epsilon. Why our country? Can have a better future our people with their struggle with the KKE together can make it happen.
