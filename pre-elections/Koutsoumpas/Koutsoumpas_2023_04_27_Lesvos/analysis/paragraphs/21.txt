I wonder who is more humanistic? The one who has the record for incarceration or the one who has the record for building hot spots? The one who built the hellhole in Moria or the one who made it bigger? We answer: None of them. All of them have fully implemented the reactionary policy of the European Union. All of them worked for and served NATO, which both makes war and creates refugees and does not recognise borders. We all remember what the parrots of the current and previous governments used to say, that the NATO armada came to the Aegean to solve the refugee problem. And in the end, the refugee problem became gigantic, and the flows increased, but also Turkish provocativeness, with the Turkish ruling class in competition with the Greek, constantly making new claims against Greece's sovereign rights, the sovereignty of the islands.
