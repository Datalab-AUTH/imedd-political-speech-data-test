After the shocking mobilisations that broke out all over the country after the crime in Tempe, the strengthening of the KKE will be the next slap that the people and the youth can give them. It will give the baton to the even greater struggles that must follow, to make them difficult, to corner them, to achieve victories. To pave the way for the tomorrow we want and can live in a different, just society, with a different, worker-people's power.
