If they really wanted to solve the refugee problem, they would put into practice the proposals of the KKE for asylum examination committees in Turkey, under the responsibility of the EU and the UN High Commission. They would take measures to deport refugees and migrants, with papers for their destination countries and transfer them to the mainland immediately, instead of building structures - prisons. They would recruit refugee workers in state structures, as these are people at the mercy of redundancy, and their considerable experience in a sensitive area could be an asset when there are so many shortages both on the islands and on the mainland. Psychologists, translators, doctors, nurses, lawyers and teachers are especially necessary, but today they are a ball for the appetites of NGOs, who are paid handsomely.
