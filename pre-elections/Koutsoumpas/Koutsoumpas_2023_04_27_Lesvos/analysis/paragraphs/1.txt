Here on the beautiful island of Lesbos, the island of heroic fighting traditions and indissoluble ties with the KKE, we are holding our first big gathering after the official announcement of the elections. And from here we want to send a strong, optimistic, hopeful message. That of a decisive strengthening of the KKE. Yes, on 21 May, our people can surprise us by taking the KKE much higher! It can strengthen its own voice, its own power, its support against tomorrow's anti-people's government by illuminating the prospect of the great, radical changes that our country needs in order to live, at last, as we deserve in the 21st century.
