It is their commitment to so-called green growth, which is only green in the colour of the money that comes out of the pockets of households and goes into the pockets of the predators. In fact, in the past week, the MEPs of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK voted for the new package of price increases on consumer goods, increases in ferry and air fares, and increases in the cost of maintaining old houses and cars under the name 'fit for 55'. Out of their great sensitivity to the environment all this - of course, of course - and to reduce - they say - pollutants. And in the same package they include in their miserable 'pollutant trade' the health and environmentally destructive burning of waste for electricity generation! Such sensitivity, along with plenty of psychedelia. Their common program is the prerequisites for the Greek capitalist economy to get the notorious "investment grade"! This is shown by their bickering over who is more capable of achieving it.
