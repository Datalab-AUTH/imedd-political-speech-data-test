SYRIZA, again, says that it too is entitled "to govern for the first time with its programme", without troika and memoranda! As if the people owe him because he did not abolish the memoranda and did not throw out the Troika, as he promised, but brought in a third, even worse one. Not to mention so many others: Mandra, Mati, so many deaths during his term of office. But who are they kidding?
