On this waterfront in July 2021, at the events of the KNE, thousands of young people, together with the people of the island, we sent the message that the friendship of the peoples will win, that in Greece and Turkey the enemy is the same, NATO -Governments and capitalism. That it is worth fighting for socialism which is the future, without crises, war and refugees. And that only with this vision alive, we can have conquests today, not to accept modern misery and tragedy, not to bow to those who made the Aegean Sea a sea of dead for their interests.
