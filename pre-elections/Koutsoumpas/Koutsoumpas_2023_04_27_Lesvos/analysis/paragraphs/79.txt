Cancer patients have their own Golgotha with available appointments at the hospital for simple MRI from September, while for radiotherapy, scintigraphy, PETSCAN the "population criteria" apply and they are forced to go away from the island. The health centre in Mandamado remains non-existent. Here in the town of Mytilene, the closure of the health centre, which is already under-functioning, is being initiated, with great consequences for the workload of the employees of the "Vostaneio Hospital". The neighbouring Limnos remains without an ICU and an Intensive Care Unit, without basic specialties.
