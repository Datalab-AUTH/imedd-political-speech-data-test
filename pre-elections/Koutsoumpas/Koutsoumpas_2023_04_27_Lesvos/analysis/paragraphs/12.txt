But because some people - both from the Southwest and from Syriza - pretend not to understand what we say about governments, let's say it again: Every government that comes along continues on the path of the previous one and is even worse, because it is getting worse and worse for the system that these parties serve. So the Syriza-ANEL government was the worst until then, the current Mitsotakis government is the worst until now, and the government that will come after the elections will be even worse. That is why we need a much stronger KKE.
