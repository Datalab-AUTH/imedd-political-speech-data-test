Communists are firm supporters of friendship between peoples, we fight against the hatred of nationalists, we support mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries for the benefit of our peoples. Clearly, therefore, we would not be opposed to the resolution of every existing issue with Turkey and every neighbouring country, through negotiations, through talks, peacefully. But we warn that this is not the case. The statements made by the government, by Mr Dendias and by Mr Tsipras the other day in Berlin are one thing. These are developments which, on the one hand, in the name of 'peace', will open the 'Aeolian floodgates' for new wars and, on the other hand, will deprive the peoples of Greece and Turkey of important resources which could be used for the benefit of both peoples, and not for increasing the profits of capital. The solution and hope, therefore, lies in the path of struggle that we can walk together.
