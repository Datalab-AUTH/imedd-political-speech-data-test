Their commitments to the system, to big capital, to the various imperialist centres, are even greater today than ever before. Look at the symbolism: Mr. Tsipras used to come here to Lesvos during the election campaign and say "go back" to the German Chancellor, bowing down to the struggles that the people of Lesvos have fought along with the communists. Now, in the election period, what is he doing? He goes to Germany and meets the German Chancellor to "expose" his program and "get his blessing"! How times are changing... He did not, of course, go to meet the thousands of workers who were on the streets that day against the social democratic government of Germany that is exterminating them. That, you see, would have spoiled his narrative that all we need is to become supposedly like other European countries, where the people there live just fine.
