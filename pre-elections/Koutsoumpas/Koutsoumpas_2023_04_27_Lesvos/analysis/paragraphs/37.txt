But we also have others who want to pass themselves off as "newcomers" and ask the people for a chance. Like the PASOK of Mr Androulakis, who says he has never governed himself, unlike Mitsotakis and Tsipras. The fact that he was PASOK Secretary and Venizelos' right-hand man when he was in coalition with ND and Samaras is probably a detail he has forgotten. In fact, as we hear, PASOK has its eye on the KKE's headquarters in Lesvos.
