The "grey zones" have been enlarged to "Blue Homeland". Not only do we have violations, but also overflights over Greek islands, which have resumed after the earthquakes. Treaties defining borders are being challenged.  From here, from the island of Lesvos, from the northeastern Aegean, we want to denounce once again that this unacceptable claim is being made on the back of NATO, which does not recognise borders in the Aegean. It has the support of the USA and the EU, which "put their economic and political interests in Turkey in the balance". In other words, all those who are drinking water in their name and have the audacity to present them as guarantors of sovereign rights.
