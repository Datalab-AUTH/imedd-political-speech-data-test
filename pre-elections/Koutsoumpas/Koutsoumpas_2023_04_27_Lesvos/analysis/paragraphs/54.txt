Nor will we forget the attempt to persecute elected officials and other militants, among them the members of the KKE, the president of the workers' centre, who is our candidate, and the secretary of the Federation of Agricultural Associations, because they "incited the people to stop".  And it is a shame that not a single party has issued a statement, except for the KKE, to prevent those who did the will of the lesbian people from being persecuted.
