But it is also worthwhile to see what the other parties' stance on the refugee issue has been so far. I wonder who among ND, SYRIZA and PASOK did not swallow the Dublin Treaty, the EU's demands, whose own direction is the creation of prison structures on the islands? Besides, the unacceptable EU-Turkey joint declaration, which bears the seal of SYRIZA as it took place during its time, is maintained in force by the current government of ND, while PASOK does not make a sound. PASOK, of course, is hosting on its electoral list a candidate who voted for the abomination in Vastria, co-opted by the chosen one of the South-West, and after having been a pioneer in the implementation of the Dublin Regulation, today it is hypocritically talking about its revision.
