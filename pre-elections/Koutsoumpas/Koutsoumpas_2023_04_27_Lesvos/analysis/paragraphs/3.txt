They have the audacity to wag their finger at the people, talking about the danger of "ungovernability and instability"! Who are they kidding? What will prevent them from forming a government? Have they not all co-opted everyone in previous years when that was required to continue to bleed the many for the gains of the few? Didn't they vote for the memos together? The first of PASOK, the second of ND and PASOK, the third of SYRIZA which all three voted for together? Didn't ND and PASOK vote for half of the bills of the SYRIZA-Annel government and SYRIZA and PASOK for more than half of the bills of the ND government?
