Here on the beautiful island of Lesvos, the island of heroic fighting traditions and indissoluble ties with the KKE, we are holding our first big rally after the official announcement of the elections. And from here we want to send a strong, optimistic, hopeful message. That of a decisive strengthening of the KKE.
