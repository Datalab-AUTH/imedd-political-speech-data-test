Friends, compañeras and compañeros. There are just over three weeks left until the polls open. And the people of Lesvos and the whole country will have the opportunity to give a resounding answer to all the above and to all that still plagues and torments them. We call upon you to give all your strength, every day, every hour that remains, so that the call for the strengthening of the KKE reaches everywhere. Because only a much stronger KKE will be the optimistic, subversive news that the popular vote can bring forth on May 21. Only a much stronger KKE, against the false dilemmas and above all against their common unpopular programme that will be implemented by whichever government emerges, can be an element of popular uplift and hope in a period when our people need it so much.
