We have already seen and heard a lot. We will see and hear even more in the coming weeks. No worker, no farmer, no self-employed professional, no scientist, no young man or woman should be subjected to the blackmailing dilemmas, nor to the phony bickering staged in front of the cameras by those who have ruled all these years and have brought us to this point, continuing one after the other on the same dead-end road for the people.
