We want from here, from the island of Lesvos, from the northeastern Aegean, to denounce, once again, that this unacceptable claim is being made on the backs of NATO, which does not recognize borders in the Aegean.

In other words, all those who are drinking water in their name and have the audacity to present them as guarantors of sovereign rights.
