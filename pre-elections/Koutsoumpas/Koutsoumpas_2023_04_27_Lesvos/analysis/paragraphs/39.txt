Mr Varoufakis closes the dance of the so-called newcomers, along with other former ministers of SYRIZA, who are running for election with the slogan "first time break"... As if we don't know them from the good and the bad... They present themselves in front of us and tell us that last time Tsipras fooled them and they didn't catch up... Together they sat in the government benches in 2015, mocking the people by implementing an adventurous policy.
