We remind Mr.Tsipras that when in the past he was short of MPs to pass the third memorandum, he found them in the MPs of ND and PASOK. That is where he can look for them today. And if he wants to see who is paving the way for the Mitsotakis government, he should look at himself in the mirror, since his party, SYRIZA, supported the central choices of the Mitsotakis government and his own forces are making a compromise with the forces of ND and PASOK in municipalities, trade unions and in the GSEE.
