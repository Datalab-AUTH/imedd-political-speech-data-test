Frankly, we didn't expect them to live up to our motto so quickly: "Alone and all of us"... Otherwise, they are fighting like roosters in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and swear that they have huge, supposedly insurmountable differences! Of course, where the New Democracy was saying that it was only going for self-reliance and Syriza was saying that it was only going for a coalition government if it was the first party, slowly their executives started to chirp. "It is one thing what the parties say in the run-up to the elections and another how they will manage the situation after the elections", they are now saying... Vote and wherever it comes out, they say, to the people. And then they will tell him that "now that you have voted, no mistake is recognized after you leave the ballot box"...But we know very well what will come out, whatever governmental scheme they come up with: Another unpopular government, worse than the previous one, which will launch a new, more ferocious attack on the rights of our people.
