But they cite difficult budgets when it comes to staffing the health centres with all specialties and scientific staff. Currently no health centre on the island has a cardiologist and radiologist, while there are not enough paediatricians and gynaecologists. The Vostaneio hospital is suffering from shortages and many patients are forced to turn either to the private sector for simple examinations or to Athens and Thessaloniki. The psychiatric clinic is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, with its antiquated building and staff shortages. Cancer patients are going through their own Golgotha with available appointments at the hospital for simple MRIs since September, while for radiotherapy, scintigraphy, PETSCAN the "population criteria" apply and they are forced to go far away from the island. The health centre in Mandamado remains non-existent. Here in the town of Mytilene, the closure of the health centre, which is already under-functioning, is being initiated, with great consequences for the workload of the employees of the "Vostaneio Hospital". The neighbouring Limnos remains without an ICU and an Intensive Care Unit, without basic specialties. The struggle of the people of Lesvos for health and safety in means and infrastructure, the mobilizations of farmers' associations, unions of actors, struggle committees, the Labour Centre, have annoyed them and have had an effect! That is why now, during the election campaign, all the candidates of the parties who are part of the problem appear and talk about strengthening the health structures! They have had plenty of time over the years, if only the governments and their parties would have done so! But they have done the opposite. Let them not treat the people of Lesvos like natives who will sell mirrors. Only the KKE opposed the commercialisation of health care, in and out of parliament, regardless of which government promoted it.
