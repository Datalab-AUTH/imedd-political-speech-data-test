Friends, compañeras and compañeros. We are proud of the attitude of our comrades over the years on the island. We are proud of the uprising of the Lesbian people in February 2020, which sent the repressive forces and the riot police back where they came from, perverting the authoritarianism of the government. This uprising proved that when the people want it, they can, and no one can be reckoned with by underestimating the power of the people. This power has been demonstrated on many other occasions. Both historically in this place, but also throughout the country, throughout Europe, throughout the world.
