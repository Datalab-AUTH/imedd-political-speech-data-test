Communists are firm supporters of friendship between peoples, we fight against the hatred of nationalists, we support mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries for the benefit of our peoples. Clearly, therefore, we would not be opposed to the resolution of every existing issue with Turkey and every neighbouring country, through negotiations, through talks, peacefully.
