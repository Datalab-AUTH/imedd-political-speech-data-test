After the shocking mobilisations that broke out all over the country after the crime in Tempe, the strengthening of the KKE will be the next slap that the people and the youth can give them. It will give the baton to the even greater struggles that must follow, to make them difficult, to corner them, to achieve victories. To pave the way for the tomorrow that we want and can live in a different, just society, with a different, worker-people's power. On Monday, May Day, the day of the global working class, in the strike rallies in every city, on every island, and here in Mytilene with the Labour Centre. On May 10, in the student elections, our youth, who took the step last year, to make the leap this year, again raising very high, the All Student First Force. And on May 21, we raise our Party, the KKE, much higher; we can do it! Alone and all of us! With a much stronger KKE, for the great, the beautiful, the shocking!
