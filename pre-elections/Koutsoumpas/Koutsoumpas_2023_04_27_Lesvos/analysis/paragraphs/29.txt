Besides, we have experienced such tragedies in other parts of the country, in the Aegean and on Lesvos. The Samina shipwreck was also a tragedy. Even today there are ships with broken engines, with inadequate and exhausted crews, without a doctor, and we hear people calling from the reception desk to register passengers who happen to be doctors. A tragedy was also the loss of the farmer in Polychthon who lost precious time until he was taken to hospital due to shortages. Tragedy was also the loss of the young infant Michael, named after the militant struggle committee in Polihnito to staff the Health Centre immediately.
