Nor will we forget the attempt to persecute elected officials and other militants, among them the members of the KKE, the president of the workers' centre, who is our candidate, and the secretary of the Federation of Agricultural Associations, because they "incited the people to stop".  And it is a shame that not a single party has issued a statement, except for the KKE, to prevent those who have done the will of the lesbian people from being persecuted. The militant traditions of the lesbian people remain alive, and are having an impact on the people of the island, with the decisive contribution of the communists, and on the refugee issue. It has been proven that the people save the people in difficult and unprecedented circumstances, where the state shows its hostile face in this way as well.
