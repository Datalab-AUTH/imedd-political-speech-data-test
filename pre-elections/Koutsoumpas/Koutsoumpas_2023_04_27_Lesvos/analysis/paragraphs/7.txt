And since spring is well and truly here and the notorious "hard winter" is over, let's see: Was it hard for everyone? This year, listed companies on the stock exchange will distribute their largest dividends to their major shareholders since 2009. And with very little taxation, since SYRIZA took it from 15% to 10% and ND from 10% to 5%. Banks, respectively, posted pre-tax profits of €4.5 billion, while a number of energy and oil monopolies are showing historic profitability performances with over €1 billion in one year. All this and more is their common agenda. So while they chase the investment grade, the people and youth have a vested interest: To raise to a higher rank their solidarity with the KKE, their struggle for their own needs and rights.
