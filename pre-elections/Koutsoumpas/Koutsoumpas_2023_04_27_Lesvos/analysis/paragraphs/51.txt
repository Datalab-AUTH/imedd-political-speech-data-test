We are proud of the attitude of our comrades and other fighters, who isolated racism and cries of hatred when the boats of uprooted people were coming to the coast. Their attitude was decisive in the face of those who tried to turn the justified anger of the islanders against uprooted people, and not against the politics of war, uprooting, exploitation and refugeeism.
