But we also have others who want to pass themselves off as "newcomers" and ask the people for a chance. Like the PASOK of Mr Androulakis, who says he has never governed himself, unlike Mitsotakis and Tsipras. The fact that he was PASOK Secretary and Venizelos' right-hand man when he was in coalition with ND and Samaras is probably a detail he has forgotten. In fact, as we hear, PASOK has its eye on the KKE's headquarters in Lesvos. What would the people of Lesvos want with another MP who will run to give a vote of confidence to whatever unpopular government emerges, to sit on our necks to continue to make our lives unlivable? Mr Varoufakis closes the dance of the so-called newcomers, along with other former SYRIZA ministers, who are running for election under the slogan 'first time break'... As if we do not know them from the good and the bad... They present themselves in front of us and tell us that last time Tsipras fooled them and they didn't catch up... Together they sat in the government benches in 2015, mocking the people by implementing an adventurous policy. And what are they calling the people to do? To believe that "everything can be different" within this barbaric system and within the EU, run by a handful of parasites, because they have, they say, ready-made technocratic solutions. But within this system the poverty of the people is growing. And poverty remains, whether you measure it in euros, or whether you measure it in 'DEMIRA' or 'ANDREA', whatever the name of the currency...
