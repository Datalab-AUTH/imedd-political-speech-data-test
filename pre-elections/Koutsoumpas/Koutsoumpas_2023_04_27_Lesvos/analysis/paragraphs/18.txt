We are proud of the attitude of our comrades and other fighters, who isolated racism and cries of hatred when the boats of uprooted people were coming to the coast. Their attitude was decisive in the face of those who tried to turn the justified anger of the islanders against uprooted people, and not against the politics of war, uprooting, exploitation and refugeeism. We all know very well that the KKE did not fold, did not change its position on the refugee issue, and not in words but through its pioneering action. This action took many forms. The mobilisations in this square to prevent our islands from becoming prisons for EU refugees are not forgotten. The mobilisations after the many years of shipwrecks are not forgotten, so that we do not get used to death. The moving mobilisation in the cold, mud and rain at the Vastria site, which cancelled the bans with the mass of city workers, youth and farmers from Kalloni, Mandamado, Mistena, Thermi and other villages, is not forgotten.
