But their commitments are great, as they are at the service of capital, which sees its position improved through the EU and NATO.They are hypocrites! They are not even thinking about the refugee flows today when they send arms to Ukraine. All together they applauded the Nazis of the Azov criminal battalion in parliament. All together they are celebrating Alexandroupolis and its transformation into "Souda of the North". Nor is the promotion of NATO plans for any reason other than the dangerous present-day "co-exploitation" of the Aegean. In this direction, it is sought to use the earthquake as an "accelerator" of a solution that will benefit the monopolies that will reap the wealth of the Aegean at the expense of the people's interests and the environment.
