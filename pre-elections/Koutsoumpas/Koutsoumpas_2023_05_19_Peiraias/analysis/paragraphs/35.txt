One is the real, genuine anti-fascist vote the day after tomorrow: And that is the vote for the KKE that fights them and not, of course, for those who coddle them for a few votes! And know, comrades, nothing is stagnant! A good example: For the second consecutive year, the once immaculate castle of the GOP, the University of Piraeus, was filled with red ballots with the carnation of struggle and hope, making "Panspoudasisti" the leading force in the student elections again, and even with increased percentages, votes, sending the party of the Southwest to the agyrist, as happened all over Greece!
