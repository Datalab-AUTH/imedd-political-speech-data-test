He who will vote for the KKE will know that this is not an isolated act, but that he and thousands, hundreds of thousands of other people will feel proud, will be able to break all kinds of blackmail, putting his own little stone to make the KKE as high as possible. Because all of us can be stronger, with an even stronger KKE and leave alone those who think that they have the people in their hands, that they can blackmail them without any limits. To make their fear a reality. And the more they fear, the more hope for us, the many, will grow. Because a strong JCP means a strong people. And the people have experience. They know us, they know us, that's why they trust the communists in the trade unions, where the daily battle for survival, for wage increases, for safety measures in the workplaces is fought, and they see the power of the unions growing, coming alive with the participation of more people, like the thousands in the Metal Union in the Shipbuilding and Repair Zone in its recent elections.
