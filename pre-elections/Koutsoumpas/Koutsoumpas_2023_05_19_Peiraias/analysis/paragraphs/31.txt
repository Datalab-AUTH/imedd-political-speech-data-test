Yes, well! The KKE has both a programme of power and a programme of governance and is ready to contribute so that this truly popular governance can finally come to the fore. And we pledge to make the night a day, with a much stronger JCP always at the side of the people, until its final victory. We will not stop for a moment to get in front of the workers' and people's movement, where stability for the people, for their lives, for their first home, against auctions and evictions, everywhere, as we did during the election period.
