Because a vote for the KKE is a vote that is incompatible with submission, with the unpopular one-way system that this system cultivates. It is a vote of punishment to those who have brought us to this point and are preparing a similar continuation. It is a vote to expose the truth about everything that is happening against our people. It is a vote of honesty and confidence in the power that the people and the youth hold in their hands. Most of all, a vote for the KKE is a vote of hope and optimism to strengthen the struggle for an overall better life. It is the only vote that will cut the wind out of their sails, but will give a broader uplift to our people. It is the ballot with the hammer and sickle of hope, pride and honesty.
