That's why SYRIZA is blackmailing the people, wanting to steal votes from people who are struggling, who want to change this situation. What is the progressive governance that we are being told, when in the basics it is no different from what we are experiencing today? Unless, of course, he considers progressive all those who he has gathered on his ballot papers, who he is also slugging it out with here in Piraeus: the shipowners, the big businessmen of the zone. No, we won't give them the word 'progress' so that they can tarnish it further. For us, progress lies in the people, in their struggle, in their fight for social change.
