Holding fast to the thread of the fighting traditions and heritage of our people. Honouring the 100 years of the heroic Kokkinia. Honouring the anti-fascist victory of the peoples on May 9th where the blood of Pavlos Fyssa was spilled in Keratsini. And not by fishing for gold-digging Nazi votes, as Mr Tsipras did the day before yesterday. It is a shame and a disgrace for every left-wing, democratic, progressive person to utter what he uttered and continues to utter today. As if so many years of criminal activity had not passed... How many drifters, Mr. Tsipras, can there still be of the 160,000 votes Golden Dawn got in 2019, and not 600,000 as you keep saying on the various channels? But Tsipras and his cohorts are stuck you see and they are counting 2012, that's why they are mutating more and more to the right, more and more reactionary!
