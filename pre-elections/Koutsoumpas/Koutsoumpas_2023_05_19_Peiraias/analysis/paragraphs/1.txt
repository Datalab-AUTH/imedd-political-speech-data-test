Friends, compañeras and compañeros, From today's gathering here in Piraeus, we want to say with all our strength: yes, we can! Our people can surprise! To do what all those whose policies have undermined our lives, crushed the rights of workers, undermined the life of the new generation, are not expecting. To lose their words, to not know where it came from! We can do it! Let a very strong KKE emerge from the ballot boxes on Sunday, a support for the people! And especially here from Piraeus, the city where our party was born 105 years ago, the city of the great workers' and people's struggles! We say with certainty that it can do it now, with a powerful KKE throughout the city, in all neighborhoods, with a rise in votes and percentages in every district, in every municipality. To redden again the neighborhoods of Piraeus, Perama, Nikaia, Keratsini, Drapetsona, Korydallos. To fill the ballot boxes with thousands of red votes, everywhere! Let the people of the city breathe!
