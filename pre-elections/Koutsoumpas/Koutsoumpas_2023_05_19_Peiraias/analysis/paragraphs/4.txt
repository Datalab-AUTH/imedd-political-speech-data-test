This strength was also shown the day before yesterday, when no hammers fell at Zoni, at the Elefsina shipyards, at Molos Drapetsona, at the Spanopoulos shipyards, because it was a strike day. This is the power of the working class, when it realises its position, its interests, who are its friends and who are its enemies, and sees that through collective struggle it can also extract conquests that prove to be valuable breaths of fresh air in the harsh reality we are experiencing. And it sees, who are stepping forward in this struggle, every day, every hour, without calling for any waiting, even a breath before the elections.
