But the workers, all the democrats of Piraeus, must make all this a voting criterion this Sunday. Those who were still thinking of voting for the SYRIZA party, under the justifiable indignation that this ND government has caused, we say to them to abandon them all while it is still time: both ND and SYRIZA. Because, as Tsipras presents it, probably those who murdered Pavlos Fyssas, who murdered the migrant workers, who attacked PAME trade unionists, were also some "misguided" people who believed that this is how they were fighting the system, as he said. Why, what difference does it make to describe as misguided those who know all the above and -10 years later- insist on supporting this criminal organisation? Why doesn't Tsipras really take a trip to the B. Piraeus to be told about the multifaceted support of the criminal Golden Dawn by various suspected business interests and circuits? Doesn't he know what all Piraeus residents know, that the Chrysaigites had contracted the attack of the Zoni employers on the militant trade unionists, the communists, PAME?
