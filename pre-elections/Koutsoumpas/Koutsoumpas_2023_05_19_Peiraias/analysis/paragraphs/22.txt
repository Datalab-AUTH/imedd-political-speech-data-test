Friends, compañeras and compañeros, in that world, which is indignant at the unceasing attack on it by all the governments, one after the other, and says to us in good faith: "but can't something be done now to change our lives radically, immediately, even a little for the better"? We answer him as follows and invite him to reflect here and now: No government has brought about immediate changes in the interests of the people. No government has not brought immediate changes for the people; on the contrary, all the governments so far have brought immediate changes, but they have made our lives worse and more difficult. The people, however, only saw immediate positive solutions when they themselves fought against these governments that oppressed them. The COSCO workers, for example, with their struggle, with their steadfast and courageous attitude, managed to join the Heavy and Unhealthy category, to open the debate on a Collective Labour Agreement, to improve their working conditions. Seeing their strength, they managed to get immediate results and defeat the hitherto invincible giant. So yes. The people can also see immediate solutions, only by strengthening the KKE and its struggle.
