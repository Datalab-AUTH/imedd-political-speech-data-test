Because a strong KKE and at the same time weak other parties that will form the next anti-people's government will mean, from the very next day, strong struggles with achievements that will improve the life of the workers. The KKE has this possibility, because the very proposal of power and working people's government has as its criterion only the modern social needs and not the profits of the few, the exploiters of the people. Because never, in all its heroic course, has it not only not committed itself to those whom the other parties worship, but it has clashed with them with all its strength. This proposal of the KKE is also the hope for the great social majority.
