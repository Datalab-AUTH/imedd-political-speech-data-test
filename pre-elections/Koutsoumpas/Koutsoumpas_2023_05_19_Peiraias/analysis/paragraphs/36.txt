With this message of optimism, we are making the most of every hour, every minute left. So that May 22nd finds the people stronger, with a stronger KKE here too. With communist deputies in both the first and second districts of Piraeus. Yes, a vote for the KKE directly strengthens the voice of the people and in parliament, it will become a force in the struggles we will wage. You have seen what we have achieved, what we have brought out, what we have promoted, with only one MP, Diamanto Manolakou, all these years. Imagine, if we had more deputies throughout Piraeus, throughout Greece.
