Despite the homeric squabbles over who and how to govern, there is a common approach from the Southwest, Syriza and PASOK on the basic issues that determine what the governor will do. That's why they can get along fine in the GSEE administration, which took a vacation in Kavouri when the workers went on strike on March 8 to share out the chairs in the presidium. Or their forces in municipalities where there is a communist mayor so that he is not re-elected, as they are doing in Patras. But even in municipalities with a militant tradition, where a communist mayor can be re-elected, as they are doing here in Kaisariani, where the factions of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK have become one.
