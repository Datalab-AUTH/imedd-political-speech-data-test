Now you feel it well that the heart that beats loudly, on the left, can only be JCE! The heart of all can beat loudly on election night, if the KKE is much higher! Come together and let's do it! To strengthen the optimism, the hope that we can pave the way for real progress! Comrades, we continue, we do our best! We are now in the last and most crucial phase of the great political electoral battle that our Party is waging against the bourgeois political system and its parties. A decisive battle for the next day, for the perspective of the people's struggle, for the people's movement itself to emerge with greater potential, with the KKE stronger against any version of anti-people's government. We know well that much will be decided in the coming days by how many more forces are thrown into the battle. That is where our strength lies. This is our task. Now is the time of collective and individual responsibility, of every communist, of every communist, of all friends of the Party. To appeal broadly to every man of the people, to the young people, to women, without any limitation, without any prejudice, without any hesitation, without any fear, regardless of what each and every one of them had voted at other times. There are, this time especially, no limits and barriers in the working - people's world where the KKE is addressing. There are more people everywhere today who are concerned, who listen positively to what our Party says. We use every day, every hour left in these 3 weeks to reach as many people as possible. In neighbourhoods, in workplaces, in schools, in universities, with our election leaflets, the "Rizospastis", the ballot paper. Organize many, many small and large meetings. To discuss the Party's policy, to answer questions, to repel the opponent's attacks, his dirt and to disable his dilemmas. To put in the fight, to show what those who sincerely tell us they want to see a much stronger JCP on 21 May what they must do.
