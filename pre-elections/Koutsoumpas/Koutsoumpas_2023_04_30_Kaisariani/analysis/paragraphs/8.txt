Compa√±eras and comrades, Friends and friends, With today's event and especially with the daily and tireless action of thousands of members of the KKE and the KNE, we are strengthening the thread that unites us with those who sacrificed for a world without exploitation of man by man, for socialism - communism. The dead workers of Chicago in 1876, the apology of Spice, the attitude and the shocking last notes of the 200 communists before their execution in Caesarian, the dead men and women workers at Fourmee in Northern France on May Day 1891 are among the many historical lessons that inspire us, mobilise us, to face with the same vigour, with the same pride, the onslaught of the authoritarian state, of the unaccountable employer. To hold high the flag of the interests of the working class against its exploiters, against the imperialists who are bloodying the planet. It is a guide of inspiration for the working people to bring to the fore the satisfaction of their modern needs, to fight for the wealth produced and stolen by a handful of parasites.
