Yes, honest people are outraged when even today, some adventurers, supposedly progressive, dare to put the flag of the struggle, of EAM, ELAS, EPON, next to the bloodstained flag of the USA and NATO. This is what we say again from here in Caesarea: No one is allowed to marry the values, concepts, symbols and flags for which so many fighters sacrificed. We are not just holding a few carnations in front of the cameras. Along with them, we hold above all the flags of struggle, of struggle. We hold these flags high and continue.
