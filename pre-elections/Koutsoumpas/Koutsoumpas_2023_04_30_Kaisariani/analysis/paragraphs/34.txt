A stronger KKE and in the elections multiplies these resistances, gives other possibilities for the preparation of the overall counter-offensive. So let's put it into practice! From here, from the heroic and unyielding Caesarian we address all those who feel leftist, democrat, progressive, all people of good will. To all those who were outraged to hear Tsipras in Menidi today speaking to the Pontian repatriates and reproducing all the rusty propaganda of the bourgeois staff against the Soviet Union because they understand that progress and anti-communism are not compatible. To all those who do not seek the lost honor of the New Democracy, as Tsipras and other Syriza cadres do, they do not put various designations in front of "right" because they do not exonerate, they do not wash anyone. To all those who, when SYRIZA MPs voted for the anti-people's bills of ND, they were shouting against.
