May 1, 1944 was a day overflowing with red blood, but also overflowing with courage and pride. One by one, 200 communist resistance fighters left proudly, without bending, without asking for a pardon. Even those who were presented with the opportunity to spare themselves, like the hero of the KKE Napoleon Sukatzidis, refused, so that no one else would be in their place. These were always the communists. They are the same today, in different physical conditions, where we have to face different types of dilemmas, blackmail and threats.
