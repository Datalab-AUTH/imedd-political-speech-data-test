To impose the reinstatement of the collective bargaining of the National General Collective Agreement as a starting point for raising the minimum wage by adopting the demands of the trade unions for increases above 850 euros and the simultaneous reinstatement of the three-year minimum wage. This practically means that a worker with a three-year contract will see his or her salary increase to 935 euros today and not in 2027 as promised by the ND. This proposal is linked to the other proposals of the KKE for a fixed daily working time, 7 hours, 5 days, 35 hours and no unpaid overtime, with the reintroduction of Sunday-working time. It is linked to the proposal for an inflation-based wage adjustment clause. With the restoration of the 13th and 14th salaries in the public sector, about which the Southwest and Syriza do not say a word, and the granting of all salary scales. With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles we can impose the restoration of the sectoral Collective Labour Agreements and their compulsory nature without terms and conditions, which is a basic condition for increasing wages in all scales. This is the only pro-people's answer to the lies of the New Democracy, Syriza and PASOK that the average wage will supposedly be increased without repealing the laws that have undermined the Collective Labour Agreements.
