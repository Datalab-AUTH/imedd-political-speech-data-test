Tonight let us all enjoy the wonderful concert that our favourite artists have prepared for us to get some extra strength. Tomorrow we flood the streets and squares all over the country, commemorate the day of the global working class by going on strike. Demonstrating that our future is not barbarism and exploitation, that to their blackmail and the realism of subjugation, we respond by bringing our own contemporary needs to the fore. Yes, we are putting our own needs and the needs of our children first. Therefore, therefore, strong JKE, strength for the people. Because we know better than anyone that: "It is madness to abandon our dreams. To change the world is neither madness nor utopia. It is Justice!" That is why only the people save the people on the road of subversion, with a much stronger JCP!"
