Friends, From here, from the blood-soaked shooting range of Kaisariani, where 79 years ago, on May Day 1944, 200 communists fled with their heads held high, their eyes proudly fixed on the barrels of their Nazi executioners, we commemorate this year's Labour Day. And we pledge that we will continue on their path, that we will never betray their sacrifice, so that better days will finally dawn for our country and our people that they too craved. The river of blood that watered the wall of Caesarian that day, the human corpse that roasted "just one manly stature" after each Nazi rifle shot, was another heroic act of resistance by the exploited against their exploiters.
