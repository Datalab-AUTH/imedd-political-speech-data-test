All these choices were and are made on the basis of the profitability of capital and all of them are a loss for the people. Either with a restrictive - neoliberal policy, which the anti-neoliberal SYRIZA also implemented with great success, or with an expansionist - Keynesian policy, which the New Democracy also implemented with great success. This is how we arrived at a new reduction of the real wage by 7.4% in 2022. And the Prime Minister has the audacity to ask for the support of the workers to bring the average wage in 2027 to where it was in 2011, he says - if it is reached. As we say: Live my May to eat clover... But the way out lies in the KKE's proposal and in the working class's confrontation with the unpopular policies and reactionary laws that slash workers' income and rights. With a strong KKE and mass workers' struggles we can impose the abolition of all the anti-labour laws of the ND, SYRIZA and PASOK on collective agreements and wages.
