Friends, Compañeras and Compañeros, On the basis of recent experience, we put the honest question to the workers, the youth, all our people: Can the satisfaction of our modern needs be realized within a system based and operated on the law of voracious profit? It is this law that characterizes as a cost the wages, the insurance of those without whose work no good, no service is produced. It is the same law that considers life and health protection measures to be costs, that broke up 57 families recently in Tempe, that is responsible for the dozens of employer crimes in sectors and workplaces, that wipes out working-class families.
