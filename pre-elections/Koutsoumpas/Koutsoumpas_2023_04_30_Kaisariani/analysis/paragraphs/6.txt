However, the aim is the same: to renounce our values, our ideology, the world of toil that we express. To find the people, their movement, weak, unable to stand up, unable to stand up and walk on the road of subversion with the KKE. And because they have got it bad with us, they have the audacity to tell us that we have settled down in the comfort of the opposition. Who are they telling this to? To communists and other militants who face dismissal, terror, courts for their actions? Who have given up privileges and every opportunity for individual cattle to stay by the side of the struggling people?
