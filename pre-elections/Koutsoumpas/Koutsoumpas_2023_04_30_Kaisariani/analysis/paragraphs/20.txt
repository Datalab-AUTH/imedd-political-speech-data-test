It is on the basis of this law and the objectives that derive from it that all the parties that have governed to date and want to serve this system again from governmental positions formulate their programmes. That is why all of their programs have phrases in big letters such as: "green growth", liberalisation of markets, fiscal balancing, stability of the banking system and much more. And for those who don't know, they hear some of these heavy words and they think they are caressing their ears, that maybe it's a good thing. But for many, it all means new suffering the next day. They mean new 'green' levies, auctions, very expensive electricity and water.
