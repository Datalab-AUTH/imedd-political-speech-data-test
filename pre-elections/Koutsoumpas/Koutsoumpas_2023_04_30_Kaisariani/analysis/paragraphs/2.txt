A battle between two worlds separated by an abyss. A battle between real progress and regression. It is through such heroic moments that the concept of progress has been imprinted in the collective memory and consciousness of our people, that is to say, the concept of an unswerving and unyielding struggle, even against the most difficult correlation of forces, but which always proves that the impossible can become possible and can win! This is the progress that our people know, the open-minded, progressive, left-wing people who live in Kaisariani, Kokkinia, Peristeri, in every popular neighbourhood of Attica and all of Greece.
