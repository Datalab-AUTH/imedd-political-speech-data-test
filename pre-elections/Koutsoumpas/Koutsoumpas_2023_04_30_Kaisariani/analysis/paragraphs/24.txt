Let every worker ask himself: Those who shout and fight among themselves over issues that do not touch any worker, how come they do not fight at all over issues that really affect our lives? Like the unacceptable law that bans collective bargaining on the minimum wage and gives the Minister of Labour the authority to issue a decision based solely on the competitiveness of the conglomerates? Quite simply because this law bears the names of the ND Minister, Vroutsis, and the SYRIZA Minister, Achtsioglou. These same governments brought in laws that abolished the Sunday holiday, that extended the working day. The recent amendment by Adonis Georgiades to work until 12 midnight in supposedly tourist areas stepped on SYRIZA laws. "This is a measure to modernize the economy with a developmental logic," the then Minister of Economy and Development of the SYRIZA - ANEL government said in 2017.
