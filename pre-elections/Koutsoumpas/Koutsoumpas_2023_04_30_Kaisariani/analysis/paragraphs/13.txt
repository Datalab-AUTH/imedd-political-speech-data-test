The magnificent mobilisations and strikes of March, with the basic demand that the responsibilities for the crime of Tempi should not be covered up, the thousands of young mouths shouting "PASOK - SYRIZA - New Democracy, this crime has a history", record a dynamic that must not be broken. On the contrary, it must grow stronger, spread out and become an organised current of assertion. And the impetus for this can only be given by a much stronger KKE in the May 21 elections.
