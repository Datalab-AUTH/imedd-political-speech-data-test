It is known, even to people who do not agree with us on everything, that behind every struggle, no matter what stone you lift, there will be a communist, a consistent fighter underneath. Such tried and tested militants, presidents and members of the Boards of Directors of workers' unions, federations, workers' centres, also staff the ballot papers of the KKE. These are for us the most famous, the most shining faces, because they are known and recognized by their colleagues. It is touching to hear the statements of people who recognise in the communists who act through their Unions and PAME that power which helps them to face their problem: Whether it's a foreclosure, a power cut, an attempted layoff, or an acute problem in the neighborhood. They report finding new companions and friends in the face of their personal suffering. This struggle shows the possibilities that exist to strengthen the resistance, grounding in real life the slogan "Only the people can save the people", illuminating the path of conflict.
