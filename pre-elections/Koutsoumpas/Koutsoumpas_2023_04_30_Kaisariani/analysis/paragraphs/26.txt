But let them also answer a question: If the Troika was going to govern, then why, after his inauguration in January 2015, did Mr. Tsipras come to this sacred place of the Shooting Gallery to lay a wreath and not go directly to the EU offices, the German or American embassy or wherever he felt more comfortable? Have mercy on disrespect, bullying and amoralism!
