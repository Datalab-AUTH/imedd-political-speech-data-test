To all those who do not submit their values and ideals to the bargaining of the bourgeois political system about who will implement the unpopular government programme common to all. To all those who, when they hear Tsipras saying in a vulgar, market-oriented way where he will find the MPs he may lack, so that he can become prime minister again, feel only disgust. To all those who, seeing SYRIZA's collusion with ND and PASOK, against the KKE, those who are disgusted by the dirty attacks against the pioneering communists, think it's time to move... politically, consciously and emotionally.
