Compa√±eras and comrades, Friends and friends, Today the KKE is looking you in the eye one by one. No matter what they say, no matter what they say, no matter how much blackmail they use, there is now enough experience to put them aside. And as our people say, "they've overstuffed the thing" so that they can fool us with the measures for the next election day, under whichever government is formed, we already know them.
