Here on the beautiful island of Lesbos, the island of heroic fighting traditions and indissoluble ties with the KKE, we are holding our first big gathering after the official announcement of the elections. And from here we want to send a strong, optimistic, hopeful message. That of a decisive strengthening of the KKE. Yes, on 21 May, our people can surprise us by taking the KKE much higher! It can strengthen its own voice, its own power, its support against tomorrow's anti-people's government, by illuminating the prospect of the great, radical changes that our country needs in order to live, at last, as we deserve in the 21st century.

We have already seen and heard a lot. We will see and hear even more in the coming weeks. No worker, no farmer, no self-employed professional, no scientist, no young man or woman should be subjected to the blackmailing dilemmas, nor to the phony bickering staged in front of the cameras by those who have ruled all these years and have brought us to this point, continuing one after the other on the same dead-end road for the people.
