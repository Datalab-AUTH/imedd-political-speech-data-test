On education, let me just say that it is my commitment to significantly increase the number of Model and Experimental schools, with teachers who will be better paid. Focusing on vocational education, tourism education. We already have shortages - you know better - in basic tourism professions. We will put the emphasis on tourism education. We will give young people new professional outlets for well-paid jobs. We will build a lot of new student housing. And from our universities - there we will not back down - we will eradicate all the hotbeds of lawlessness. We are with the libraries, not the sledgehammers. We want universities to be centres of education, of excellence, of creative dialogue, and not abbeys to which the various grocers will resort.
