Because, yes, we can, I think so too, we can pick up the thread of rapprochement again. We are never going to dialogue with the absurd. We will always follow the path of international law for our only difference, the delimitation of maritime zones, the EEZ, the continental shelf, or the path of understanding, we can go, but we are not going to be naive. We are not going to be na√Øve, we will weigh Turkey's actions and not its words, and we will always oppose any challenge to national sovereignty and sovereign rights. One more thing, on the occasion of today's development, the arrest of the candidate for Mayor of Himarra and member of the Greek National Minority, Freddy Beleri. We are right at the south-eastern end of the country, but I want to send a message to Albania from here: Greece will not accept any discounts in the rule of law and in the protection of the rights of the Greek National Minority.
