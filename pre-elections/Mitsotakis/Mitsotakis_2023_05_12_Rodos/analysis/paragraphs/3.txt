So I ask you: did we do all this?  Yes, we did. I heard a friend say "the first one to tell the truth is you". Yes, because politicians must be judged on the consistency of words and deeds. And because you will never hear lies from me. I told you I'd cut taxes, we cut 50 taxes. I told you I would cut ENVIA by 30%, we cut it by 35%. I told you that we would reduce contributions, we reduced them by four percentage points. Import tax rate from 22% to 9%. The solidarity levy is a thing of the past, as is the parental benefit tax, so that every parent can pass on their property to their children free of charge.
