In the face of an aggressive Turkey, I had a duty, my friends, to shield the Armed Forces and the deterrent power of the country. New Rafale aircraft and upgraded F-16s are often flown here, over Rhodes, over Kastelorizo. You don't see them but you can be sure and confident that they are there to guard us. Soon, here in our seas, three new frigates will be sailing, state-of-the-art, the most modern ships in the Eastern Mediterranean. From 2028 we will integrate into our Armed Forces the most modern aircraft available today, the F-35. And I pledge that the country's arms programs will continue under the next New Democracy government alongside our country's reborn shipbuilding and defense industry. For us, you know it, I will say it again, better than anyone, the defense of the country is the ultimate end in itself. There is no prosperity and economic recovery without freedom, without the defence of national independence and national sovereignty.
