As I came to talk to you today, I was thinking about how different Greece 2023 is from Greece 2019. Look, I am not saying that there are no difficulties. Of course there are difficulties. And there is still accuracy and there is still more investment we can attract and there is still this feeling that we need to go one step further. But the image of our country is getting better everywhere. But especially here, in the South Aegean, you have managed to reverse negative trends that exist in the rest of the country. You are the only region that has such a high population growth. Tourism, this great national bet, the great regional bet, this important blood donor of the Rhodes economy, has increased by almost 15% compared to 2019. I predict, judging by how the tourist season has started, that 2023 will be a record year as well. Congratulations to all the protagonists. Because you have made it happen to a large extent, with excellent cooperation between the private sector, employers, employees. You are the ones who are investing. The hoteliers, the entrepreneurs. Investments have been launched here in the South Aegean, in excess of two billion euros. Today, the Minister of State, together with the regional governor, presented the new development plan, 500 projects leading our islands to 2030.
