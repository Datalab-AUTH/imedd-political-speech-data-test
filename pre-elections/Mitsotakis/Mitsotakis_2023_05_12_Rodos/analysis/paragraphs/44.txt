PASOK of Mr.Androulakis, unfortunately, has become an unlikely partner of SYRIZA, dragging his party into a blind front against New Democracy. I have sometimes said that everyone is united on one thing: that we should not be the government and that Mitsotakis should not be Prime Minister, but this does not constitute an alternative proposal for governance. And especially for the friends of PASOK, they should think again about their vote in the next elections, because, to paraphrase the verse, 'they have moved to go elsewhere and their leader is going elsewhere'. Look, I cannot easily follow this dangerous Babel of opposition. I can, however, see the precipice to which we are being led. So I insist that in an uncertain international environment, with Turkey in front of us, with major geopolitical challenges, Greece needs more than ever before certainty, continuity and consistency, a clear horizon for its course and a clear solution for its leadership.
