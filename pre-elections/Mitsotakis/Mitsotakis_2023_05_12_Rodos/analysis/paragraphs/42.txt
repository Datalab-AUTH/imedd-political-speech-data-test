So, everything is grey around us and of course, always behind the prospect of a new cooperation with Mr Varoufakis, who are calling for the Greek people's euros to become "Executioners", a paper war on deposits, "local currencies". This is new, the 'local currencies' that Mr Tsakalotos is telling us about. That is, as far as I understand it, other money in Rhodes and the islands, other money in Athens. Dangerous things. It would be funny, but, unfortunately, it is very dangerous. And they are dangerous, friends, because these ghosts of doom can come back now, through the simple proportional representation. A trap of ungovernability left behind by Syriza.
