The dilemma of the ballot box is therefore clear: do we go forward, continue on this path of progress, or do we go back? Do we want results or do we want lies again? Do we want better wages and salaries or do we want taxes and cuts again? Do we want borders secure or open to every threat? In other words, do we choose New Democracy with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis or Syriza with Prime Minister Tsipras? That is the dilemma. It is very simple. In the end, it concerns all of us. It concerns our lives. It is about who will sit in the Mansion Maximeo taking on this heavy responsibility for the next four years. We weigh, decide and vote. On May 21, the stronger the strength of the vote towards the first and the distance from the second, the easier the road to certainty and hope will open.
