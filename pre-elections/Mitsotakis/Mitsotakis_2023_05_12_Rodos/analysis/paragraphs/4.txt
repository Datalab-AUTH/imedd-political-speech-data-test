Do you know what all this amounts to? Seven billion euros less per year. While public revenues are increasing, as growth is running at twice the European average. We have successive records in exports, in investment, in tourism revenues. You here know this very well because Rhodes, the Dodecanese, have always been leaders in tourism development. And you will be the big beneficiaries of the new tourism boom. You will also benefit from the many new jobs that we will create.  300 thousand in total. The minimum wage to have risen by 20%. From 650 euros to 780 euros. Among us today, many pensioners. I remind you that it was from New Democracy that you got the first increases in 12 years, by 8%. But also those who were wronged by the Katrougalos personal difference were boosted by EUR 200 to 300, and I pledge to continue to support you until the personal difference is finally erased.
