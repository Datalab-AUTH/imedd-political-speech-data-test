Let me pick out a few. I will make a special mention of the hospital, which I visited today, so that I can unveil the bust of Dimitris Kremastinos and at the same time commit that you will finally have a radiotherapy centre here in Rhodes. Its construction is under way immediately. Immediately. With funds from the Region and the Ministry of Health.New schools in your municipality. Kritinia and Gadoura dams. I just passed by a while ago -remember the visit to the National Theatre- it is being put out to tender immediately. Another of my commitments which is being put into practice.
