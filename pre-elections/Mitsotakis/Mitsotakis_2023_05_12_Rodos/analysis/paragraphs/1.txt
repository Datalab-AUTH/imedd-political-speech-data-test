Young Democrats of Rhodes and the Dodecanese. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this impressive reception. Fly the flags of victory, fly the flags of our country, fly the flags of the New Democracy. You know, ladies and gentlemen, that your enthusiasm always gives me a special strength, as it comes from a place that is on the frontier, but also from a centre of economic progress. A national shield but also a symbol of progress. That is why his message, the message here in Rhodes, the message of all the Dodecanese, Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayor, in the elections of May 21, will have its own double meaning for the certainty and the perspective that Greece needs today. I know, of course, that the patron saint of the island, Saint Constantine, is celebrated here on 14 November. Am I right? But on the day of Constantine and Helen, Rhodes and the whole country will also celebrate the feast of democracy. A big thank you for our youth, for our ONNEDites. Eight and today they remained until Victory Sunday. That is why we are doing our best, so that not only Rhodes, but all the islands of the Dodecanese, the Cyclades, will be blue, on a blue map of the country.
