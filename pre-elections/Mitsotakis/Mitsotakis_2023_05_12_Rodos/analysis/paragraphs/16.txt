Let me open a parenthesis here, friends. Our programme is fully costed. At the debate I issued a challenge - an invitation to all the political leaders, a challenge that goes without saying: send your programmes either to the General Accounting Office of the State or to the Bank of Greece, so that we can cost them, so that we can see who is finally talking with real numbers and who is giving you kelp for silk ribbons.
