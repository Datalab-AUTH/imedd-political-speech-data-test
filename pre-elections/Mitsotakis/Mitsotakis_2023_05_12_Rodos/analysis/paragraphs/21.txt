I have already spoken to you about social Greece. Two main priorities: health and education. We cannot have patients suffering in corridors, waiting months for an operation. I am committed to rebuilding all the emergency departments in hospitals. We will rebuild 156 health centres from scratch. But the most important commitment: yes, we will hire 10,000 nurses and doctors to permanently fill the gaps that exist And we will find a way through telemedicine and through increased incentives to be able to staff especially our islands, I know there are difficulties today to find medical personnel who can serve our islanders, especially on the smaller islands.
