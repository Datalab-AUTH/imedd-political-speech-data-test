So I say it to you again, here in Rhodes. On Sunday, eight days from now, there is no room for frivolity. Any mistake will set us back. It will cancel conquests. It will also cancel our claims of tomorrow. It will be a mistake that cannot be corrected later. You know the answer. It is another and it is one: a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. In 2019 I spoke to you about the need for the old divisions to be a thing of the past. And, indeed, I think they have faded to a certain extent, in the light of experience. The result we all seek has the colour of truth. And ultimately of effectiveness. This is what unites in New Democracy our fellow citizens who may come from different ideological backgrounds.
