Of the objectives of our programme, I single out the one I spoke to you about before as the crowning goal: better incomes, better wages. The minimum wage will reach EUR 950 at the end of the four years, including all the related benefits. The average wage could reach EUR 1 500. We want to support families with children. The tax-free allowance is increased by EUR 1 000 for all families with children, and we increase family allowances in the public sector.
