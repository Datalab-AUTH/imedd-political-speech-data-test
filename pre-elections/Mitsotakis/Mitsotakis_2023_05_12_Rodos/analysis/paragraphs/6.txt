But, since I am here, on the borders of our country, national objectives were also the ones we set in 2019 and now they are a reality, and I am talking about migration and strengthening national defence. Indeed, you know best how in four years a country has been transformed from a "dry vineyard" to a homeland with borders on land, air and sea. Illegal flows have been reduced to almost zero. Lesvos, Chios, Kos, Leros, Samos have breathed a sigh of relief. Before I came to talk to you, I was in Lesvos. Moria no longer exists. The "cellar" of Moria is history, it belongs to the past. We now have humane accommodation structures. And, yes, as much as it may bother some, the fence on the Evros is expanding, guarding the national and European borders.
