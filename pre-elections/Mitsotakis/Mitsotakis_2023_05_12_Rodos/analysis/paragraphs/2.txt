You remember the great difficulties we overcame together. The hybrid attacks in Evros, the large migratory flows here in the Aegean, in the North Aegean, but also in Kos and Leros. Immediately afterwards, the successive waves of the pandemic. Then the energy boom from international inflation and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Almost daily - you know better than anyone - the aggressive provocations of our neighbours. But the country did not buckle for a moment, the economy endured and society remained united. Together, we have built a huge mound, more than 57 billion, in order to support workers, businesses and jobs. In the southern Aegean alone, more than EUR 1 billion in special-purpose compensation, in repayable advances, were directed, mind you. And targeted aid for all those hit by the crisis. You know very well today that if your tourism is doing so well, it is because we kept the tourism industry alive during the difficult years of the pandemic. But at the same time, we did not lose a moment of commitment to the commitments we made in 2019. I told you then that we would reduce taxes and contributions, that we would bring in investment and many new jobs. That we would boost income by supporting the most vulnerable first. That we would shield our borders, strengthen our national defence and finally, upgrade the country's international standing. This is what I told you when I came to talk to you before the 2019 elections.
