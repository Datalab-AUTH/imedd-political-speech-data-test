And this course, this dynamic, is also reflected in the liberation of the national economy from all supervision. We talk a lot about the investment grade. I will say it again here from Rhodes, Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayor, its recovery is not some neutral objective, it is essentially a passport to cheaper money, to the ability of businesses, the state, households, to borrow at a lower interest rate. It is a national goal, which can be achieved in 2023, but under one condition: that the next day finds the country with a stable transformative government at the helm, the government of New Democracy. Then we will achieve investment grade.
