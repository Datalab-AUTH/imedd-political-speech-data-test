But in order to achieve all this, friends, we need to do what is happening here in Rhodes, in the Dodecanese: we need investment, we need high growth - it can exceed 3% on average. Unemployment will soon fall below 10% and private investment can increase by 70% in four years. So can public investment. Already, as I said, the whole of Greece has become a vast construction site. I was told, my dear George (Chatzimarkos), Mr. Regional Governor, by my friend Regional Governor Kostas Agorastos in Thessaly where I was, "once, four years ago," he said, "we were looking for projects. Now we are looking to find the companies that will do the projects that we have put out to tender." This is the best indication of progress we have achieved over the years.
