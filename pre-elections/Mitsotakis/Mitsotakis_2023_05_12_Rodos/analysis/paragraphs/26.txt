And of course, people with disabilities, I am particularly sensitive to this because of my mother, Marika Mitsotakis, who was the first to fight for the de-vitalisation of disability and I know that among us there are many friends of Constantine and Marika Mitsotakis. Because my father and my mother had many friends here in Rhodes. And I felt it was my duty to implement one of the flagship programmes, the Personal Assistant, and I thought it was our duty to be the ones to implement it. Do you know what it is for a person with a disability to have a person by their side for 8, 9, 10 hours a day? To be able to accompany them to their work, in their leisure time? To be able to free the family from the care and the need to be there for the disabled person all the time?
