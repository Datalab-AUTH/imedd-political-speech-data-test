Everywhere I go I see projects that are being launched, projects that were stalled. Patras - Pyrgos in the Peloponnese. The BOAK in Crete, this crucial road axis. The other important roads, the E65, I am coming now from Thessaly. But, I want to make a specific reference to the way I understand the dividend of development to be shared by all.
