This is the message I ask you to convey here, in Rhodes, but also on every island of the Dodecanese. Young Democrats, the heart of the party, Rhodes, this ancient crossroads of cultures and ideas, should show the avenue of victory for a self-reliant Greece, for a self-reliant New Democracy, for a better future for the Dodecanese, for the Aegean. No wasted vote, everyone to the polls, to give New Democracy the great victory for the Greece we deserve, for the Greece we can conquer. We move forward steadily, we move forward boldly, we move forward only. Thank you for this impressive reception, keep our flags high, keep hope alive, we are going for a great victory. Here together we will celebrate it after the election. Be well, good race, good victory.
