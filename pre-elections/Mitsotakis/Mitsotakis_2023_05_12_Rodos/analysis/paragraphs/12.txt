I want to welcome especially here from Rhodes the new collective agreement signed with the hotels of Rhodes, with wages much higher than the national agreement. A contract, I stress, that the Ministry of Labour has declared compulsory, which now means that it is binding on all businesses. I think it is very important that a receptionist, a chambermaid, have a salary that is close to 1,200 euros per month and that is without bonuses. Because, yes, that is how salaries are ultimately increased. As unemployment decreases, as turnover increases, the response of businesses will be better wages for everyone. You can't have growth without boosting workers' incomes. And you here in Rhodes have begun to put that into practice.
