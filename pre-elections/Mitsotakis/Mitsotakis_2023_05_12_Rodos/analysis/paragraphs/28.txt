We have talked about green Greece many times, especially on the small islands. We can put it into practice much faster. We will generate much more electricity from the sun and the wind - good time today, look what a beautiful sunny day with lots of wind. Think how much more electricity we can produce and how much less gas we need to import. Isn't that right? Because seven billion is what we all paid for gas imports. Never mind that we were geopolitically dependent on anyone who threatened to cut off our natural gas. We can provide cheap and clean energy for everyone. DOE programs are already running. You can see the great response to programs like Save Money, Change Water Heaters. There is a great demand. Why? Because this is how your own energy costs are ultimately reduced.
