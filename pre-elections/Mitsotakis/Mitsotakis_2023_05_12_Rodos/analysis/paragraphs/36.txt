Mr.Tsipras insists, as I understand it, on boasting, telling us what a good job he did in the last four years, how he got us out of the memoranda. Be careful, it was he who got us out of the memoranda. After he put us into the memoranda, he then got us out. It's like someone setting their house on fire and then being proud because they called the fire department. He still boasts about the 17-hour negotiation.  I say to him, "You negotiated 17 hours and brought back a memorandum that cost us 100 billion. And I negotiated for five days when we were discussing the establishment of the Recovery Fund. Five days, but I didn't bring back a memorandum. I brought the Recovery Fund with 31 billion euros for our country." That is the difference. So let us keep this memory of a Greece of taxes, of pension cuts, of a time when some people could not see borders at sea, when they turned the country into a transit centre. The closed banks. The closed banks, which they caused, now he is telling us, watch out, he is asking to govern without a memorandum for the first time.
