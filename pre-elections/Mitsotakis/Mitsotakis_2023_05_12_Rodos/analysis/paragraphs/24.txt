We have a lot of young people among us and the first thing the new couples tell me is: "how am I going to get a house? Why should I be doomed or condemned to live in rent or worse, live with my parents until I'm 30?" We've come up with an answer to this problem: for the first time, the My House programme gives young people significant financial incentives to own a home with a subsidised loan with a payment, mind you, much lower than what you would pay for a rental. Twenty-thousand of our young people will be able to own a home immediately with this program. Social consideration will follow. Do you know how much land we have right now, public land, that is essentially undeveloped? Why not give it to the private sector to build apartments? The developer will keep some and we will develop the rest so that we can give cheap houses to our youth. All of this is possible. We can do it.  These are not science fiction plans.
