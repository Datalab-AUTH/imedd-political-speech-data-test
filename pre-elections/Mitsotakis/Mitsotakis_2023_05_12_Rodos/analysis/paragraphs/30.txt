Finally, I have already told you about a strong Greece. The arms programmes will continue and the fence on Evros will be built. Our Coast Guard will continue to be equipped. I was in Lesvos today and I visited one of the new vessels that we have already received, with many capabilities. Thermal cameras allow us to see exactly what is happening at night. We have other vessels that we will receive and important equipment projects that will be completed.
