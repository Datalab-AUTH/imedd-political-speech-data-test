We have proved that we can do that too. Just as we can produce many things in our country. So Lavrion suddenly regains the productive base it had and lost. Under different circumstances, however, and with a different potential. To produce products that are exportable and exportable. The companies that come here and invest in Lavrion are companies that, as a rule, offer much better jobs, higher wages, better working conditions for employees. Why am I saying this? To demonstrate through the example of Lavrion that the way to bring better and well-paid jobs to our country is none other than the path we have already taken. Lots of private and public investment, better jobs, well-paid workers, in better conditions, with digital job cards everywhere now, so that there is no employer abuse. In a creative environment, where businesses do well and workers can do even better.
