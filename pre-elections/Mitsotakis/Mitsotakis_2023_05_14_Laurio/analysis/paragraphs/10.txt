I am tired of hearing that others are more sensitive than us. Some others are, he says, more progressive than us, just because they are left-wing. No, friends, we are the real party of progress and social cohesion. We must finally speak in deeds and not in words. These, then, are just a few nuggets from our plan for the next four years. I do not want to bore you much longer, it is a beautiful Sunday and I know that you too want to go and sit down to eat with your families. To celebrate our mothers, to honor and celebrate them and to thank them for all that they have done. I should note, of course, how much importance we attach to supporting working women.
