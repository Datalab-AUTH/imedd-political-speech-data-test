Mr.Regional Governor, Mr.Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, Young Democrats, one week left to celebrate a great electoral victory. I am very happy to be here with you today here in Lavrio. A short while ago I had the opportunity to give my interview in a place which marks not the past, but the future of Lavrio as I envision it. And, indeed, I do not forget, my Mayor, that this space was secured for the Municipality of Lavrio as a place of innovation and development by Constantine Mitsotakis. Thank you very much for the gardenia, it was - I must tell you - the favourite flower of Marika Mitsotakis, and I want to say happy birthday to all the mothers who are celebrating today. Thank you very much.
