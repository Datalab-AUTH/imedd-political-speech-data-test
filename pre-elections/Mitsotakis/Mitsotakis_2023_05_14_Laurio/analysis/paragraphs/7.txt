But a productive Greece must also be a socially just Greece. I want you to know that for the second four-year term, my personal bet is the complete restructuring of the National Health System. There you will see great progress and very important steps, with many investments that will be made in our hospitals. And I know, yes, that somewhere in East Attica we owe a hospital. In East Attica, why does a hospital have to be built? Because East Attica is one of the fastest growing regions in the country, with a large population growth, and we need to make sure it has the infrastructure it deserves. But it's not just the buildings that make the health facilities. We will hire 10,000 nurses and doctors over the next four years. At the same time, we will also put a very strong emphasis on the personal doctor. It's an institution that is already taking root and it's very important to know that you have a reference point, a person who knows your whole picture, your medicine. In digital tools, that your prescriptions and your tests can now come to you on mobile through "MyHealth". All of this is a revolution in the way we deliver health services. And, of course, in preventative screening, which I attach so much importance to, because there is nothing better that we can do than to prevent a disease before we have to treat it afterwards.
