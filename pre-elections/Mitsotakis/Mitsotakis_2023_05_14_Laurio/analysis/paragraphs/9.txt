To make a special mention, I see Stelios Kympouropoulos with us and I want to thank him for what he has done and is doing in the European Parliament. I want to say that the Personal Assistant that we are now implementing throughout the country, two thousand of our fellow citizens with severe disabilities will have the opportunity, with resources secured, to have a person by their side to help them in their professional and personal lives, so that we can finally free families from this burden, was a vision of Stelios. I am very happy that we were able to implement it and secure the resources, and it is further proof of how we really understand social sensitivity.
