We have secured the country, we have protected our borders, we have strengthened the Armed Forces, we have made Greece more credible abroad, with a voice that can be heard from Congress to Brussels. I assure you that the voice of Greece is heard today. And it is heard everywhere. In other words, we have laid the foundations for the Greece of the next four years. A Greece which, first and foremost, must be able to produce wealth and prosperity for Greeks.
