But this is a course which is not predetermined and it is not certain that it would continue if, by no means, there were a change in the political events of the country. That is why I am so insistent on the criticality of these elections. This work that we have been doing must continue and intensify. In eight years' time, if we had eight years of government - which we will have - Greece will really be a different country. I ask you to give me this opportunity, this work that we have done with our staff, so that we can continue it, so that we can complete it. Because then the changes that we have initiated will really have taken root to such an extent that no one will be able to reverse them. I am sure, friends, that we will be given that opportunity. I am sure that on this important day that half of Greece is celebrating, Constantine and Helen, including my son, it will be a day on which we will be able to celebrate the great victory of the New Democracy, which will also be a victory for Greece. Thank you very much. Let us go and find the last remaining votes, let us fight until the last moment. The elections are decided in the end. We have stamina. We are marathon runners, we are not sprinters, but we will do the final sprint this week and we will be the big winners.
