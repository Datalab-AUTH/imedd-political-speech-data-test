Here, allow me to make a reference to what the Mayor said and to highlight, through what is happening here in Lavrio, my own overall vision for Greece of growth, prosperity and well-being. Lavrion is a place that was identified with industrial production, a place identified with the demands of the labour movement and a place, at the same time, identified with the deindustrialisation and decline of the last decades. And yet, here in Lavrion today, something very important is happening. And what is happening is not only in the service sector. Yes, my Mayor, you can be absolutely sure that the marina here in Lavrio will be expanded, we will support it. Lavrio must become the first yachting gateway of Attica. Why? For the simple reason that from here the distances to go, especially to the Cyclades, are much closer, so this is something that everyone is looking for. And of course, around yachting a number of other activities are developing that give life not only to the port, but also to many professions around this industry which is so important. So important for the Greek economy and Greek tourism. But you see that suddenly we have gone from yachting to boat building. Because, indeed, it was strange how a country with such a great shipbuilding tradition, a country that has the most beautiful seas in the whole Mediterranean, why do we have to import inflatable boats and not be able to build them here?
