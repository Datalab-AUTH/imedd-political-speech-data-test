Friends, there are seven days left until the elections on 21 May. You see, this election period is going by quickly, but I am glad because we have been given the opportunity until today to be able to explain to the Greek citizens our vision for Greece for the next four years. This electoral period has given us the opportunity to draw clear lines between our own political proposal and that of our opponents and, above all, to focus on the problems that interest and concern you. Because we often go to interviews and answer questions that are of interest to journalists but are not close to the real demands of the citizens. What I am interested in is to use every hour of time available to tell you how we are going to make Greece better in the next four years. We can make it much better. Because we have achieved a lot in four years, in the midst of very great difficulties, a pandemic, a refugee crisis, a neighbour who was constantly giving us problems, an energy crisis. But we kept society on its feet, we supported the world of work, we supported small and medium-sized enterprises.
