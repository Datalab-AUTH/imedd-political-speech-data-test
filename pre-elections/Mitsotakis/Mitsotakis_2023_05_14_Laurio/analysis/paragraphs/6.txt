And, of course, this is for the private sector, because as far as the public sector is concerned, the Mayor is right to say that the local government has never seen more money than it did under the New Democracy government. Isn't that right, Mr. Regional Governor? And Patoulis is giving money here. Well, so the money has to work. And what is important is that the projects we are launching are projects that serve a central development vision. We are in very good consultation with local government and ultimately we know that many problems have to be solved locally. The state cannot come in and do everything, but through good working relationships we can build a real future of optimism and prosperity for local communities. This is our goal, our central objective for the next four years.
