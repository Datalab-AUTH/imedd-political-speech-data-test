We did it with breast cancer very successfully. Seven thousand women have been identified with early breast cancer, they will get well, precisely because we found the cancer early. Because we went to these women, many of whom had never had a mammogram. We went to them and said, get a free mammogram at a public or private facility, and they went, they found the problem. Yes, it's not easy, we're all afraid to get screenings, but it's much better to do them and find the problem early before we run afterwards when it's too late.
