A government that will continue this work, which we have already started, a government that will implement a programme that is costed and well thought out. A few days ago I had the opportunity to present my vision for Greece for the next four years in a different way from the usual ones. I had first and foremost the young people in mind.
What will Greece live in in 2027, in 2030 How will we continue on the path of recovery? How - and this is my first priority - young children will be able to find better wages. In 2019 I committed to you and I delivered on my pledge to cut taxes, so now I commit to you that the next four years will be a four-year period of better wages for all and for all. It will be the four years of more investment.
