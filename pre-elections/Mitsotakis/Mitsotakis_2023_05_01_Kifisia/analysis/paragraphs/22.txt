In any case, as we go into the elections, we will always speak coherently, politically, without complacency, without arrogance, without seeking either aggravation or polarisation.We have things to say about what we have done. We have courageously acknowledged our mistakes and we are committed to correcting them. But above all we have a plan for the Greece of the next day.
