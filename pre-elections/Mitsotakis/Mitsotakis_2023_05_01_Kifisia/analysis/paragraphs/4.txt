New Democracy is with May Day and Tsipras is with April Fool's Day. Because nothing but lies. He is a month behind.
Our friend tells us that pensions have been given. Mr Tsipras found a pensioner in Chios who did not receive his pension, but he did not tell us that he owed 40,000 to the funds. What the pensioners know is that pensions are now being paid in two months where they took two years to be paid.
