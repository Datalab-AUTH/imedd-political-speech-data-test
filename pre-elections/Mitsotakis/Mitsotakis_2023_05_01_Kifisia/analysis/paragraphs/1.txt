Good month, good victorious month for our New Democracy party. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this spectacular participation in our call. To be with you today in my municipality in Kifissia and to see among you many old friends with whom we have been marching since 2004 and have fought many victorious battles together. This battle we will win. I did not expect such a turnout today on May Day, 20 days before the national elections which will decide whether our country will continue on the path of progress, progress and national self-confidence or whether it will turn back to a past that we all want to forget.
