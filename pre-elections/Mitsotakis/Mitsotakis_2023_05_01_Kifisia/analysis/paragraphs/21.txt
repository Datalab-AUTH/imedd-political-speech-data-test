And speaking of democratic vigilance, I cannot help but comment on an event that is unacceptable in the extreme. Yesterday, the deadline for the parties to submit memos on the case, which is being heard in the First Chamber of the Supreme Court, on whether the Golden Dawn cutthroats will be able to form combinations and run in the national elections, ended.New Democracy submitted a memo arguing on the merits of the case. PASOK submitted a memorandum. SYRIZA was absent. Absent once again from democratic duty. From the democratic duty to keep out of Parliament those who dress in the guise of a party, when in reality they are a criminal gang.I regret that some people are still turning a blind eye to the extremes and fishing for votes in murky waters.
