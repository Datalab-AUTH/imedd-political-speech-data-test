It will be a four-year term in which we will make even more leaps in the digital state.Few of you remember your life, our life before gov.gr. We made a revolution, we revolutionized the way citizens and businesses communicate with the state. The queues we used to know are now a thing of the past, but we still have many steps to take to make the state truly digital and the behaviours of state officials, all behaviours worthy of your expectations in one thing I will not back down: evaluation everywhere and for everyone; and rewarding effort and results. That is what we expect, that is what you expect and that is what we can make happen in the next four years.
