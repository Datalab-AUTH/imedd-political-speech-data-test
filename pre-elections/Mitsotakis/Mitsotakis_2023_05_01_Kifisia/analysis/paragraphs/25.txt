In which our fellow citizens, our friends, who did not traditionally belong to the new democracy, can also participate in this great effort, but who are now coming and joining this great common effort, because they understand what the elections are all about. They know very well that the country must keep moving forward, aiming high, will not turn back with your help, support with your help. We will be the big winners. Be well. I wish you a good race. Good strength, good May Day. Be well. Thank you very much for this amazing gathering.
