Mr Tsipras went to Chios and did not say a word about the refugee issue. Because obviously, if this discussion were opened, people would remind him of all the nice things he said, that the sea has no borders, that everyone can enter our country without any controls. I am proud, friends, that we have implemented a strict but fair immigration policy. The country has borders and must protect them on land and sea.
