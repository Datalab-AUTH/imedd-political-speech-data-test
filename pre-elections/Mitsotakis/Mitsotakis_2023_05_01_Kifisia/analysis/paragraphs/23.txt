We want to oppose politically both the grey and the black of SYRIZA, which describes a Greece that exists only in their own historical imagination. We contrast the Greece of optimism, of smiles, of self-confidence, especially of those young children who want and honour a Greece that is more powerful and that gives them the opportunity to live a life better than the one their parents have created.
So let's go and fight this fight together, I always say, and I now have enough electoral experience. I recognize that elections are not won by us, by the prime ministerial candidate, by the parliamentary candidates, and we have an excellent ticket here in the northern sector. Ultimately they are won by each and every one of you, no vote should be wasted, and I stress that because the May 21 election is the only election to which we have all our focus at this time. There is no second ballot for us, there is only one good one and it is May 21. If we want to close every loophole in so-called progressive coalition governments involving all those who want to replace your Euros with Demetrios, there is only one way to do it, a strong new democracy on the night of 21 May. I am absolutely sure that we will succeed.
