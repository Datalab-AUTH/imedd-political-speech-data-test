I told you that I would make the country an attractive country for investment again and yes this government has created 300,000 new jobs. And when we talk about social policy, there is no policy with a bigger footprint than a policy that can lift an unemployed person out of poverty and finally give them the opportunity to get ahead, to work with a decent income. And I told you a third thing, I will make our country safe and proud again. And yes, we have fortified our borders.
