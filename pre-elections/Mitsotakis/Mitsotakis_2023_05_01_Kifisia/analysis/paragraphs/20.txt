I just want to make the counterpoint between a party that has a costed and well thought-out programme and an opposition party that promises benefits of more than 70 billion without saying anything else concrete, trying to fool the citizens again, as it did in 2015.I answer them here, from the North Sector, from Kifissia, that 2023 is not 2015. The citizens have suffered and learned. They do not want a second time in the disaster. They will give a second mandate to progress. And that message, especially here from the North Sector, we will send it and we will send it in a deafening way. It is a message of democratic vigilance.
