See, for example, health. Maybe in the pandemic, the National Health System held up, had more ICUs, many more health workers, but our health has been the big patient for decades. That is why I am not satisfied with the steps we have taken forward. We need to make leaps, especially in our hospitals, especially in our emergency departments and in the prevention of serious diseases.
