To talk to society about our successes. To acknowledge - and I am the first to do so, always, courageously - our weaknesses. By changing the country, we change ourselves. And this is the message I invite you to take to every municipality, every district, every home, every citizen, every young person who, without party blinkers, believes in the patriotism of responsibility, believes in the modernisation of creation.
