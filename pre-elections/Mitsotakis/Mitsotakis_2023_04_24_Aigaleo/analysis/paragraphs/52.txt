We who know from the inside how dangerous things were in July 2015, we know very well that what sounds ridiculous, what I have described to you, is at the same time very, very dangerous. It must therefore be crushed on the mound that all responsible Greeks will raise. Exclude with your vote a "rag-tag" government. Exclude any cooperation that brings paralysis.  After the May 21 elections I will return here, in West Athens, having won my personal bet, that West Athens will be blue for the first time. And we can and we will. Friends, tomorrow's government must not be a hostage to party bargaining. Decisions cannot be lost in endless negotiations.
