I could, friends, talk for hours about our report. I will not do so, I will not bore you, I will not talk about the major roads that cross the region, about our irrigation projects. I have not said a word about the Thessaloniki Metro, which is ready, it is not painted on canvas. About the new airports. About double benefits.
