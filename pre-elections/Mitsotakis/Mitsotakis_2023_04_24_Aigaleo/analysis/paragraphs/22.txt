But at the same time, along with the economic recovery, we have also strengthened our defence. To those who did not see borders at sea and wanted them open on land, we gave a double answer. We zeroed out refugee flows. We relieved our islands, we built modern structures instead of the shameful structures of Moria. We saved lives in the Aegean. And, yes, we extended the fence on Evros. The fence is being extended, let those who fought it and are still fighting it hear it well.
