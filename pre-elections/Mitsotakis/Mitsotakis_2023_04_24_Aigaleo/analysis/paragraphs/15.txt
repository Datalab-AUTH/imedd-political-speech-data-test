The new three-storey building of the university, the equipment of its laboratories, the energy upgrade of 12 schools and the Attikon Hospital, the pilot renovation of the refugee houses in Agia Varvara, the new town hall in Egaleo. And a little further away, the regeneration of our shipyards, in neighbouring Elefsina. The workers went back to work. And notice, they came back on what wages? From 1,500 to 3,000 euros.
