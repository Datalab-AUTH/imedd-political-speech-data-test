However, SYRIZA also seemed incapable of opposition. It said - and hold this back for your own political sake - "no" to everything and "yes" to nothing. No to tax cuts, no to an increase in the minimum wage, no to armaments, no to defence agreements, no to the Evros fence. Watch out, not even on the rights of our fellow citizens with disabilities, and no to the protection of the Parliament from the "straw men" of the Golden Dawn.
