See for example what is happening here in West Attica. Long ago, Metro Line 3 terminated not far from here, in Agia Marina. It is now connected to Agia Varvara, Korydallos, Nikaia and Piraeus. The very important Line 2 tender, which will finally connect Anthoupoli with Ilion, is also being developed. While the road connection of the Western Regional Road of Egaleo with the Athens - Corinth National Road is also planned.
