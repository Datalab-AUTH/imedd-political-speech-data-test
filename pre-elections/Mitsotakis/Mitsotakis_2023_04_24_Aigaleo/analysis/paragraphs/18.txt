Fellow members of the New Democracy, in the truth agreement we signed four years ago I also committed myself to a secure homeland. A united society, without the old divisions and for a better and more modern everyday life. I have not moved away from these goals, despite the successive 'storms' that have broken out with us at the helm of the country.
