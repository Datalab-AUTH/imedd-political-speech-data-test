And keep from here, from Egaleo, my commitment: if a strong government of the New Democracy emerges - which it will - the investment grade will be a reality before the end of the year. But, mind you, on one condition that is within our grasp: the stability and perspective of the country, which can only be guaranteed by a strong and experienced government on May 21. Fellow members of the New Democracy, in the truth agreement we signed four years ago I also committed myself to a secure homeland. A united society, without the old divisions and for a better and more modern everyday life. I have not moved away from these objectives, despite the successive "storms" that have broken out with us at the helm of the country. You know it well.
