So this path of recovery must continue. My goal is really to become Europe in everything. To become Europe in terms of both incomes and wages, so that we can finally come closer to our large European family. With an economy that is growing rapidly. With wages that will be in line with Europe, with a minimum wage that will reach EUR 950 at the end of the four years, with an average wage of EUR 1 500 and with the continuation of a tax reduction policy that has produced such impressive results. We have relieved you of a total of EUR 7 billion in taxes.
