This policy of tax cuts will continue. We will increase the tax-free allowance by EUR 1,000 for each child, we will reduce the presumption of income by 30% and, yes, we will abolish the tax on business income within four years, the last tax left over from the memorandum, a remnant of an era that we all want to forget.
