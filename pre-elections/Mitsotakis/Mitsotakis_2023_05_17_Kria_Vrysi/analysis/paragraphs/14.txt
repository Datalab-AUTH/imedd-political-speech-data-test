I would like you to talk to them frankly and ask them some questions: has this government been consistent in what it told you in 2019? It told you it would cut taxes, it cut taxes. He told you he would cut taxes, he cut taxes. He told you he would guard the border, guard the border. He told you that Greece's position in Europe would be strengthened. And I went to Europe, I negotiated for five days and I brought 31 billion to the Recovery Fund and much increased resources, Mr. Regional Governor, dear Apostole (Tzitzikosta), for the new MIP 2021-2027. So we were consistent in what we said.
