So I want us all to make a bet together, friends, and I believe that it is a bet that we can win, especially here in Pella: to have a higher percentage on Sunday night here in Pella than we had in 2019. Together, we will win this bet, so that I can come back to your part of the world to celebrate a great victory, with New Democracy at the forefront, for the Greece we deserve. Steadfast, bold and always ahead; be well. Thank you very much for this fine welcome. Good strength and good fight until the last moment. Be well, thank you.
