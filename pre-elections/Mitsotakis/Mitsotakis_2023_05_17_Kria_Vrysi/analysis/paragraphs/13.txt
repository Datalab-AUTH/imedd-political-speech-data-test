I want to ask from here, from Pella, from Central Macedonia, from Krya Vrysi, to confront the last-minute complacency. Up to the very last hour we must fight for every vote that we can potentially win. All of you may know some of our fellow citizens, in our workplaces to our families and friends, who may not yet have decided what to vote for.
