Thank you, thank you for this very beautiful, very warm welcome. You know, it is always my luck to end my election tours with a passage through Central Macedonia and especially through Pella, and because you were lucky last time, we will be the big winners on Sunday night, friends. So that we can continue on this path of recovery that we started four years ago when I asked you to sign a truth agreement.
