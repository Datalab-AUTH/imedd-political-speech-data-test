But we will also support the National Health System. You know that in the time of the pandemic, our health workers kept society on its feet. They gave everything to deal with a crisis the likes of which we have never seen in the last 100 years.And here in Pella you know that your hospitals, your health centres have been strengthened. But we must do more. I am not satisfied with what we have done.We will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors and we will staff all our hospitals and health centres with the staff they need. We will direct resources from the Recovery Fund to rebuild 156 health centres, to fix the emergency departments in 80 hospitals; every health structure - hold that - will remain as it is and will be strengthened. And it will have its own special character, so that citizens can seek quality care close to where they live and not have to go all the way to Thessaloniki or all the way to Athens for relatively simple medical procedures.
