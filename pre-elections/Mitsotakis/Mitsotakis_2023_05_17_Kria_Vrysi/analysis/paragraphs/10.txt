But I want to say one more word, friends, about the big dilemmas of the elections as they are shaping up, four days before the elections.I'm here in Krya Vrysi, but some people have got a cold sweat watching New Democracy heading towards a big victory here. And in their desperation and despair they resort to a new scenario every day.And what we have not heard. "Government of losers", "government of tolerance", now we have heard "special purpose government" for a few months, he says, which will clear up the wiretapping issues.I've been in politics and I've been following elections since 1981, since I was 13 years old. Never before have I seen, four days before an election, where there is only one proposal for governance and on the other hand there is total chaos.
