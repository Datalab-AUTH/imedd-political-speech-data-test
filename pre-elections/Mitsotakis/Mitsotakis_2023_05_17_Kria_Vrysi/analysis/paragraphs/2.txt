We have honoured this truth agreement to the full. We implemented all our central pre-election commitments and at the same time we managed a series of unprecedented crises that would have tested any government.From the migrant invasion in Evros and the pandemic, to the war in Ukraine, to the international "explosion" of poverty, we managed to keep society on its feet and supported the world of work, our farmers.
