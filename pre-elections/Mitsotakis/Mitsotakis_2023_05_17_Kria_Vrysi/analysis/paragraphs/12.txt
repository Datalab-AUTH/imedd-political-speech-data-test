We will not allow them to do it again. And there is one way: to deactivate, all of us together, the bomb of the simple proportional representation, in order to close every crack in any plan for a possible government of losers.This way is none other than for New Democracy to be powerful on Sunday night. With such a percentage that no one will be able to question the next day that we must take on this heavy responsibility of governing the country. To continue the work that we have done, to accelerate our pace, to take the country higher and to move more boldly, more steadily, forward. And that will ultimately be the dilemma of the elections in the last four days.
