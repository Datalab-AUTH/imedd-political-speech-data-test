We know what we want: a self-reliant New Democracy, a self-reliant Greece. What do the others want? What exactly are they asking for? For the country to sink into instability? In chaos? In an incongruous coexistence with no beginning, no middle and no end? For a few months, he says, a government that will do nothing but investigate the issue of wiretapping? Is this serious?Look, I understand their desperation. I think that they are also moving in the same society and they see the current that New Democracy has. But they do not have the right to play the fate of the country at dice again. They did it once in 2015. We were spared, thanks to New Democracy, from certain disaster.
