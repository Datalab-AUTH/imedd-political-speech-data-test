We are still "pleading" with our opponents all the time and we keep telling them that if what you are telling us is so nice and feasible, why don't you send it to the General Accounting Office, to the Bank of Greece, to the Fiscal Council, to Parliament? We have many independent organisations that can very easily cost a programme. "Radio silence", because they know very well that the moment they do so, the extent of their lies and hypocrisy will be revealed.
