So we have achieved a lot in four years, as I said, in the midst of unprecedented difficulties. We have not only shielded the economy and society, but we have also kept the country safe, and I attach great importance to this, because the coming elections are not only elections for the economy, for health, for education. They are also elections to ensure that Greece continues to be a strong power in our region. These elections are of interest to all those who want Greece to guard its borders and not to be a "closed vineyard".These elections are of interest to all those who want us to continue to support the Greek Armed Forces and to safeguard our national sovereignty and our national independence.
