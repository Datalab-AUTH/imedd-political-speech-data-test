I was looking, as I was coming, at the statistics of the financial aid we gave to the primary sector here, for Pella, for neighbouring Imathia. More than EUR 300 million was given to your two prefectures, to your two regional units, to support the primary sector. I am including natural disasters.And you know that we are making sure that we disburse money right up to the last minute so that we can support our producers, because we want a healthy, dynamic, outward-looking primary sector.I would like to remind you that last year we set a record for exports in the primary sector, more than 8 billion euros. We can produce competitive products and give our farmers and livestock farmers the prices they deserve, so that they too can look forward to a better future. It is a commitment that this policy will continue, ladies and gentlemen, in the next four years.
