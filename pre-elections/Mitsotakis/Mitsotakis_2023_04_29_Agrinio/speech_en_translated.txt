From Democracy Square you are sending a thunderous message that New Democracy will win the elections on 21 May.
Indeed, friends, Mr Mayor, Mr Regional Governor, I am very impressed by the warm welcome you are giving me this afternoon here in Agrinio, in the heart of Aitoloakarnania. Twenty-two days before the elections, a great wave is rising, a blue wave that will bring our party a great victory. A big winner in these crucial elections of 21 May.

Friends, I had the opportunity today to drive through a large part of your county. Wherever I went, from Nafpaktos to Messolonghi, here in Agrinio, I see and feel this great coalescence of forces around New Democracy. This is the demand of the citizens that the course we have laid down over these four years should continue. To continue to make our country stronger, to continue on the road to prosperity, not to risk everything we have achieved in this difficult four-year period.

I remember, friends, when I was in Aitoloakarnania before the 2019 elections, you remember I was talking to you and asking you to sign a Truth Agreement, a new relationship of trust between citizens and politicians, a relationship of trust that is based first and foremost on consistency of words and actions. I told you then that I wanted to commit myself to certain simple things. I told you that I would reduce taxes for every Greek woman and every Greek man, and we reduced taxes for each and every one of them.

I told you that I want to put Greece back on a path of dynamic recovery so that we can put the difficult decade of memoranda behind us, create more jobs, bring more investment to our country, more well-paid jobs. And today the country is going from record to record in attracting foreign investment.

I told you that I want a strong and secure Greece that will protect its borders and safeguard our national independence in practice and not in words. Not a "closed vineyard", as a friend behind me says, and he is right because this is the Greece I remind you that we received in 2019.

Speaking of the migration issue, it is worth noting that today the leader of the opposition was in Chios, which was at the centre of the refugee problem in 2015, and he did not find a single word to say about the refugee issue, because probably no one wants to remember what he was saying, that the sea "has no borders" and that everyone can enter our country without being checked.

But those days, friends, are well and truly in the past. The country has been reinvigorated. Citizens are feeling more optimistic, they have more confidence in their abilities, and that is why this ballot on 21 May is so important.

We have left behind us four years of great difficulties. I will not hide from you that when you put your trust in me and I first sat in the Maximus building, I too did not imagine how many different crises we would have to manage during this four-year period. The truth is that we have had many difficult and many unexpected events, from the refugee crisis to the pandemic and from the crises with Turkey to the energy crisis and Russia's war in Ukraine.

I could be here in front of you today and say, "You know, we had a lot of things to do to keep the country safe, we couldn't deliver on our election commitments." I'm not telling you that because it's simply not true. We were able to keep the ship of the country safe and keep our election commitments.

That is why the time has now come - 22 days before the elections - not to talk so much about the past but to talk more about the future. I always refer briefly to what we have achieved during these four years, not to remind you of things you know. You, each and every one of you individually, know whether your life today was better than it was in 19, whether the market is moving at a better pace than it was in 19, whether our country in general feels stronger and more secure. I say this to demonstrate that consistency of words and deeds is the best credential for people to trust us again for what we want to do in the next four years.

I had the opportunity three days ago, in a different event from the usual one, to present my plan for how I envision Greece in the next four years. It is in this short booklet. It's just some of our thoughts from our Governance Programme for the next four years. On how we envision a Greece of growth, a Greece of social justice, a Greece that - as the Mayor said - must be digital and green, environmentally green, because Greece is blue, just as Aitoloakarnania is blue. For a Greece with an effective state, for a Greece that will still have a voice that will count in the world.

Because citizens never vote for what has been done in the past, but for what will be done in the future, so it is worth going through this programme to see what our central commitments are. I firmly believe that the next four years must be the four years of better wages for every Greek. Just as I told you that I would cut taxes, I am telling you now that we can significantly increase all wages in the next four years, from the minimum wage to the average wage. We can create more good-paying jobs. We can get unemployment down below 10%, we can attract more investment.

We can, and must, friends, continue to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of Europe. Because, after all, this is the foundation on which we are building our collective prosperity. We want to close the gap between us and Europe.

In 2015, in the difficult times of July, when some people played the fate of the country on heads, it was us, our party, that kept the country in Europe. But it is not enough for us just to stay in Europe, we have to become Europe everywhere. This is the goal I have set for the next four years.

So, higher wages by at least 25%, more jobs, more jobs, continuing a policy that reduces taxes in a sensible way and within our budgetary possibilities. We will abolish the business tax at the end of four years. It is the last major tax left over from the memorandum. We will reduce the tax on presumptive income, we will further reduce the tax on labour, on employer contributions, which I know how much both professionals and employees are concerned about. And we will continue to implement worker-friendly policies. Because, I was thinking, I said it in Nafpaktos this morning, we have May Day in two days.

May Day is usually the holiday on which the Left comes and tells us that it has a monopoly on social sensitivity. We answer them: no, we are the broad popular party that takes care of all Greek women, all Greeks, and looks after the world of work. We were the ones who raised the minimum wage from EUR 650 to EUR 780. We were the ones who introduced the Digital Job Card for the first time. What does this mean? That every employee when they go to work - we are starting with large companies and this will be extended to the whole private sector - will digitally swipe their card. And the employee can know that the hours they work are the actual hours and they will be paid for the hours they have actually worked.

So, I wonder, who are the truly socially sensitive and those who care about the world of work? The ones who have kept wages stuck? The ones who have been crushing you on taxes? Or the ones who ultimately give wage earners a better income and a better outlook for the next day?

But, you will say to me, don't we have today in our country precision which nibbles away at incomes? I will tell you yes, of course we do have precision, but precision, my friends, is not something that we have caused, precision is something that the whole world has today. Accuracy is the result of a war that took place on our continent. Accuracy is the result of the fact that we found ourselves with gas prices that were 10 times higher than those we had known in the past.

And yet, and in fact, we were the ones who gave support to households through the Market Pass, we were the ones who did the Household Basket, which also made it somewhat easier with the prices. And I firmly believe that the worst days in terms of inflation are now behind us.

So I would like to ask you here in Agrinio to judge the parties and the Prime Ministerial candidates objectively and to judge us harshly. See what we have achieved. What we have achieved in this four-year period and what the previous four-year period achieved in the previous four-year period.

I heard Mr Tsipras speak again from Chios and say: this four-year term was, he says, four wasted years. Really? Four wasted years? With the best growth rates in Europe, from where we were lagging behind? With lower taxes than where we had higher taxes? With record investment? With record tourism? With a record in the resources that local government has to manage? Ask your regional governor, ask your mayor, when in the past have they had more resources to manage?  Then or now? Now, because it is precisely this government that has succeeded and created wealth, secured resources from Europe, enabled the Regional Governor to have a much larger NSRF. It has enabled the Mayor to manage a 'Tritsis' programme with major interventions to further improve this city.

And we will be there to support you in the next four years. Two big issues that concern Agrinio. The first, an issue that is always raised. The connection, the safe road connection of Agrinio with the Ionian Road. The studies will be ready in the next year. I pledge that this connection, which will cost us around 100 million, will be put into practice by the government of the New Democracy.

The second is the tobacco warehouses that you have here in the wider area. By '27 - we've talked to the mayor - we're going to have an exemplary cultural space, a museum that can really showcase the cultural footprint of the city as a whole.

Just as I was in Messolonghi today at noon and inaugurated the new Archaeological Museum - I was committed that the museum would be built and we completed it - and as we have built 15 museums across the country, we will continue to support the municipalities to make your everyday life and especially here in Agrinio greener, more digital, with a better quality of life for the next day.

And speaking of digital, I want to remind you how your daily life was four years ago and how it is now: before gov.gr and after gov.gr. How we can use technology to make your life easier, so that you don't have to hassle, don't have to queue up in bureaucracy, don't have to run to the CCP for the simplest transaction.

All this, my friends, did not happen, it worked. And that is why we have to continue and by 2027 our whole state will be a digital state. And with a greater emphasis - let me say this is a personal bet of mine - on the new National Health System. Because I know very well that the NHS took a big hit during the pandemic years. And I want to say from here too a big "thank you" to all the staff of the National Health System. We were faced with an unprecedented situation. We stayed on our feet, but the National Health System also highlighted its strengths and weaknesses for the next day.

The next four years will be the four years of the new NHS, with upgraded hospitals, upgraded emergency departments in all hospitals. We will essentially rebuild from scratch, with complete refurbishment, more than 150 Health Centres. We will expand the all-important institution of the Personal Doctor everywhere and we will also expand screening so that we can prevent illness before we get sick and run to hospitals. I attach great importance to this. Never before has there been a government that has done so much in terms of horizontal preventive health policies, and I think that has its own special significance.

And, of course, on security and defence issues, we are not going to "put water in our wine". We will continue to guard our borders. The fence on the Evros will be built in its entirety. The significant investments we are making in our Armed Forces will continue. He did not vote - our hon. Friend is right to say that - let me remind you that Tsipras did not vote for the defence agreement with the United States, he did not vote for the defence agreement with France, he did not vote for the significant arms spending that is what allows us today to all feel safe and to know that we can shield our national sovereignty at all times.

Here, from a place, especially Aitoloakarnania - I said this before when I was in Messolonghi - which is so identified with our country's struggles for freedom, we must know one thing: freedom is a precondition for prosperity. And in defence of the homeland and sovereign rights, this party has given credentials for many decades.

And we're not going back. We always extend a hand of friendship to Turkey, to discuss our differences. Always in a good atmosphere and always on the basis of international law, but we will not accept any challenge to our sovereignty or our sovereign rights. There are "red lines" that are non-negotiable and we know how to defend them.

So all this, friends, I hope that it will be the subject of a fruitful election period. An election period in which we need to talk about what concerns you. Yes, we will talk and we must talk about the primary sector.

You know that we have tried to be close to our farmers. You know that I was the one who negotiated and secured for the next six years the same resources so that we can continue to have subsidies that support farm income.

We were the ones who reduced VAT, we were the ones who returned the excise duty on diesel. We are the ones who used tax incentives to encourage our farmers to work together, so that they can go from being farmers to being small producers, to link their product to the history of their land, to standardize their products, so that we can export more products. We set a record for exports in the primary sector.

And we have much more to do. Smart agriculture programmes.  I want all the young folks who are here to know that I'm going to be expanding the resources for young farmers even further. I want young kids to be able to go back to the field, to farming, to do this work and know that they can have a good income.

I want to help farmers with the cost of production. Photovoltaics for farmers, small photovoltaics. I attach great importance to such interventions so that we can reduce the cost of production and support the primary sector as a whole.

So let our opponents - if they dare - come and discuss all this. I have been tired for weeks of hearing this debate talk: 'We do not want', he says, 'we do not want a debate, we do not want a debate'. Well, the debate was agreed today, as I had told them from the beginning.

So let's all go together and talk about what we want to do, but let's also take off our masks. Because in the debate we will all be political leaders together, as it should be in a democracy. And let the other parties come and explain to us exactly how they understand this "progressive governance", this government of losers that some people want to launch.

This government that will possibly bring together, in their minds, SYRIZA, PASOK, Varoufakis, "Demetra". "Demeter" is not a joke. There is a subdivision of Demeter, you know. One hundred "Demetroulas", one "Demeter". But that would be funny if it weren't too dangerous. And it's dangerous because some people tried to do all this in '15. Some people brought us to the brink and at the last minute they had to make a spectacular fucking stunt, it cost us a lot of money, 100 billion or so, that fucking stunt.

And now they may be thinking of doing the same thing again. There is only one way to ward off these thoughts: a powerful New Democracy in the ballot box on May 21. Once we are victorious by a wide margin over the second place finisher, all these scenarios go out the window.

And I really want to ask you from the bottom of my heart to fight this good fight, to fight it together. Because we have achieved a lot in these four years. We've been tired, we've struggled, we've made mistakes. I never said I was infallible. The only one who is infallible is the one who does absolutely nothing.

Whenever mistakes were made, however, I looked you in the eye, took my responsibility and said that I would correct the mistakes that were made. That is the demand that you must have from your leaders.

And this effort, which we have made with great effort to put our country back on its feet, to leave behind a difficult decade, so that young children can look to their future with more optimism, must not be left unfinished.

The country must not fall behind again. We must not experiment again with failed recipes. We must move the country forward with stability, with boldness, with a faster pace. You know, wherever I go, people do not tell me 'don't make changes', 'don't make reforms', they tell me, as a rule, 'run even faster', 'go faster, move the country forward faster'.

And that is our commitment for the next four years. We are more experienced, we are more ready, we are more tested. We know where we want to take Greece. Give us the strength to make our country even stronger, all Greeks prosper with more social justice.

We have a plan for the Greece of the future. We know where we want to take Greece and I am sure that here in Agrinio, from a constituency, ladies and gentlemen, here, colleagues, former colleagues, probably in parliament, because now you know that we are all candidates for parliament, but you know that Aitoloakarnania is always the region we look at when we want to have a miniature of the country.

Well, here the message you send is of particular importance. I want higher percentages in Aitoloakarnania than we had in '19. And judging by your turnout today, we will achieve it. Be well. Good strength, good race and with victory. With New Democracy always strong, steady, bold, forward. Be well. Thank you very much. And good luck to Panitolikos who is playing now and that's why we thought we would finish early. Anyone who wants can go to the stadium. Be well. Bye. Thank you very much.
