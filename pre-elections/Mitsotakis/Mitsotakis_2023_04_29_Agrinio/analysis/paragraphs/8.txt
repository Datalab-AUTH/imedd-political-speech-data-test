We have left behind us four years of great difficulties. I will not hide from you that when you put your trust in me and I first sat in the Maximus building, I too did not imagine how many different crises we would have to manage during this four-year period. The truth is that we have had many difficult and many unexpected events, from the refugee crisis to the pandemic and from the crises with Turkey to the energy crisis and Russia's war in Ukraine.
