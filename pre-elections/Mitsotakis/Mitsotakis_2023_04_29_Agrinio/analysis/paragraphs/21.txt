I heard Mr Tsipras speak again from Chios and say: this four-year term was, he says, four wasted years. Really? Four wasted years? With the best growth rates in Europe, from where we were lagging behind? With lower taxes than where we had higher taxes? With record investment? With record tourism? With a record in the resources that local government has to manage? Ask your regional governor, ask your mayor, when in the past have they had more resources to manage?  Then or now? Now, because it is precisely this government that has succeeded and created wealth, secured resources from Europe, enabled the Regional Governor to have a much larger NSRF. It has enabled the Mayor to manage a 'Tritsis' programme with major interventions to further improve this city.
