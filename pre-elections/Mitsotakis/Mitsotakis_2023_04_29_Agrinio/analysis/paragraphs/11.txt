I had the opportunity three days ago, in a different event from the usual one, to present my plan for how I envision Greece in the next four years. It is in this short booklet. It's just some of our thoughts from our Governance Programme for the next four years. On how we envision a Greece of growth, a Greece of social justice, a Greece that - as the Mayor said - must be digital and green, environmentally green, because Greece is blue, just as Aitoloakarnania is blue. For a Greece with an effective state, for a Greece that will still have a voice that will count in the world.
