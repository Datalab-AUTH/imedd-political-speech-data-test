From Democracy Square you are sending a thunderous message that New Democracy will win the elections on 21 May.
Indeed, friends, Mr Mayor, Mr Regional Governor, I am very impressed by the warm welcome you are giving me this afternoon here in Agrinio, in the heart of Aitoloakarnania. Twenty-two days before the elections, a great wave is rising, a blue wave that will bring our party a great victory. A big winner in these crucial elections of 21 May.
