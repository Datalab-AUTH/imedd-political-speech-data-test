But, you will say to me, don't we have today in our country precision which nibbles away at incomes? I will tell you yes, of course we do have precision, but precision, my friends, is not something that we have caused, precision is something that the whole world has today. Accuracy is the result of a war that took place on our continent. Accuracy is the result of the fact that we found ourselves with gas prices that were 10 times higher than those we had known in the past.
