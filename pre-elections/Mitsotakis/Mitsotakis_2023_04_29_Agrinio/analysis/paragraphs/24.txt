Just as I was in Messolonghi today at noon and inaugurated the new Archaeological Museum - I was committed that the museum would be built and we completed it - and as we have built 15 museums across the country, we will continue to support the municipalities to make your everyday life and especially here in Agrinio greener, more digital, with a better quality of life for the next day.
