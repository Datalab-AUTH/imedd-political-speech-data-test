All this, my friends, did not happen, it worked. And that is why we have to continue and by 2027 our whole state will be a digital state. And with a greater emphasis - let me say this is a personal bet of mine - on the new National Health System. Because I know very well that the NHS took a big hit during the pandemic years. And I want to say from here too a big "thank you" to all the staff of the National Health System. We were faced with an unprecedented situation. We stayed on our feet, but the National Health System also highlighted its strengths and weaknesses for the next day.
