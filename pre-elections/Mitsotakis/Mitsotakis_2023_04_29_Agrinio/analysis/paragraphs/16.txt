May Day is usually the holiday on which the Left comes and tells us that it has a monopoly on social sensitivity. We answer them: no, we are the broad popular party that takes care of all Greek women, all Greeks, and looks after the world of work. We were the ones who raised the minimum wage from EUR 650 to EUR 780. We were the ones who introduced the Digital Job Card for the first time. What does this mean? That every employee when they go to work - we are starting with large companies and this will be extended to the whole private sector - will digitally swipe their card. And the employee can know that the hours they work are the actual hours and they will be paid for the hours they have actually worked.
