So, higher wages by at least 25%, more jobs, more jobs, continuing a policy that reduces taxes in a sensible way and within our budgetary possibilities. We will abolish the business tax at the end of four years. It is the last major tax left over from the memorandum.

And we will continue to implement worker-friendly policies. Because, I was thinking, I said it in Nafpaktos this morning, we have May Day in two days.
