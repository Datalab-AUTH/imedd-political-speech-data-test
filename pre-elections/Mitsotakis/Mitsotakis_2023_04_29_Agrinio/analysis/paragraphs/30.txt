And we're not going back. We always extend a hand of friendship to Turkey, to discuss our differences. Always in a good atmosphere and always on the basis of international law, but we will not accept any challenge to our sovereignty or our sovereign rights. There are "red lines" that are non-negotiable and we know how to defend them.
