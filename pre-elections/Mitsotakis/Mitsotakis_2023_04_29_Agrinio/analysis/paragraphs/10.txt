That is why the time has now come - 22 days before the elections - not to talk so much about the past but to talk more about the future. I always refer briefly to what we have achieved during these four years, not to remind you of things you know. You, each and every one of you individually, know whether your life today was better than it was in 19, whether the market is moving at a better pace than it was in 19, whether our country in general feels stronger and more secure. I say this to demonstrate that consistency of words and deeds is the best credential for people to trust us again for what we want to do in the next four years.
