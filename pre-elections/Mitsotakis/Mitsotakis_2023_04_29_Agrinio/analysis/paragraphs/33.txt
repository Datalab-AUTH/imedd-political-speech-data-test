We were the ones who reduced VAT, we were the ones who returned the excise duty on diesel. We are the ones who used tax incentives to encourage our farmers to work together, so that they can go from being farmers to being small producers, to link their product to the history of their land, to standardize their products, so that we can export more products. We set a record for exports in the primary sector.
