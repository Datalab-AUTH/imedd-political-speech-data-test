Friends, I had the opportunity today to drive through a large part of your county. Wherever I went, from Nafpaktos to Messolonghi, here in Agrinio, I see and feel this great coalescence of forces around New Democracy. This is the demand of the citizens that the course we have laid down over these four years should continue. To continue to make our country stronger, to continue on the road to prosperity, not to risk everything we have achieved in this difficult four-year period.
