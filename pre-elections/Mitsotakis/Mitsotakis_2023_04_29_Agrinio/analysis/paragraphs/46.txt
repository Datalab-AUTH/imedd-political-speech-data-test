Well, here the message you send is of particular importance. I want higher percentages in Aitoloakarnania than we had in '19. And judging by your turnout today, we will achieve it. Be well. Good strength, good race and with victory. With New Democracy always strong, steady, bold, forward. Be well. Thank you very much. And good luck to Panitolikos who is playing now and that's why we thought we would finish early. Anyone who wants can go to the stadium. Be well. Bye. Thank you very much.
