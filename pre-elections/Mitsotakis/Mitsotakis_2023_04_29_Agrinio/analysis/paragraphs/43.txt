The country must not fall behind again. We must not experiment again with failed recipes. We must move the country forward with stability, with boldness, with a faster pace. You know, wherever I go, people do not tell me 'don't make changes', 'don't make reforms', they tell me, as a rule, 'run even faster', 'go faster, move the country forward faster'.
