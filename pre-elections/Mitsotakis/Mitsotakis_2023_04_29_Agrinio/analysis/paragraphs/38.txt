This government that will possibly bring together, in their minds, SYRIZA, PASOK, Varoufakis, "Demetra". "Demeter" is not a joke. There is a subdivision of Demeter, you know. One hundred "Demetroulas", one "Demeter". But that would be funny if it weren't too dangerous. And it's dangerous because some people tried to do all this in '15. Some people brought us to the brink and at the last minute they had to make a spectacular fucking stunt, it cost us a lot of money, 100 billion or so, that fucking stunt.
