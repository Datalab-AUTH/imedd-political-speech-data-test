The next four years will be the four years of the new NHS, with upgraded hospitals, upgraded emergency departments in all hospitals. We will essentially rebuild from scratch, with complete refurbishment, more than 150 Health Centres. We will expand the all-important institution of the Personal Doctor everywhere and we will also expand screening so that we can prevent illness before we get sick and run to hospitals. I attach great importance to this. Never before has there been a government that has done so much in terms of horizontal preventive health policies, and I think that has its own special significance.
