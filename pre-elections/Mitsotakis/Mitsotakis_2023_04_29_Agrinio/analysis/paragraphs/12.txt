Because citizens never vote for what has been done in the past, but for what will be done in the future, so it is worth going through this programme to see what our central commitments are. I firmly believe that the next four years must be the four years of better wages for every Greek. Just as I told you that I would cut taxes, I am telling you now that we can significantly increase all wages in the next four years, from the minimum wage to the average wage. We can create more good-paying jobs. We can get unemployment down below 10%, we can attract more investment.
