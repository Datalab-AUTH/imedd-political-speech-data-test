I remember, friends, when I was in Aitoloakarnania before the 2019 elections, you remember I was talking to you and asking you to sign a Truth Agreement, a new relationship of trust between citizens and politicians, a relationship of trust that is based first and foremost on consistency of words and actions. I told you then that I wanted to commit myself to certain simple things. I told you that I would reduce taxes for every Greek woman and every Greek man, and we reduced taxes for each and every one of them.
