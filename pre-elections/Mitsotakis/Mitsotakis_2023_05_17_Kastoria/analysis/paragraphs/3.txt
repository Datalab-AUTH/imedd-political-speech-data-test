Here, the choice we have to make is very clear: do we keep going forward or do we turn back? Do we continue to build a strong Greece or do we return to the times when Greece was the "plaything" of Europe? Will we continue to build a policy that will reduce taxes, support growth, support pensioners or will we return to times when taxation was crushing the middle class and pensioners were paying the consequences of the Katrougalos law?The past, friends, speaks for itself. When you trusted me and we jointly signed this truth agreement to which I asked you to commit in July 2019, I myself could not have imagined how many crises we would have to manage in the past four years.
