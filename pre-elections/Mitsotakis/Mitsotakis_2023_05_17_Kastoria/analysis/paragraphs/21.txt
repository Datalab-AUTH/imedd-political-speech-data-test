We will support this effort as a whole and I want you to know that the next day I will personally deal with the specific issues that concern Kastoria. And of course with all the big challenges concerning Western Macedonia, with the green transition. You will remind me, four years from now, when we will take stock of the next four years, we will be rubbing our eyes from the investments that will have come to Western Macedonia. There is enormous interest, there are unique financial instruments, more favourable state aid for Western Macedonia at the moment, because we are also making use of the provisions of the just transition.
