So, friends, as we approach the elections, the dilemmas and choices are crystallizing with absolute clarity. We have a past, but we also have a future. We have a past of consistency and effectiveness and we have a future of hope and optimism that we want to talk about.Our opponents are - unfortunately for them, fortunately for us, fortunately for the country I would say - in a constant political vertigo. I have been watching political developments since the 1980s when Konstantinos Mitsotakis was fighting his own battle against the then powerful PASOK. And in all the years that I have either observed politics or participated in it, I must tell you that this is the first election where three days before the elections the following paradox occurs: on the one hand there is a clear proposal for governance: a strong and self-reliant New Democracy for a self-reliant Greece. This is what we stand for. And on the other hand, there is absolute political chaos.Notice the sequence of what our opponents have said. They have talked about a government of losers. They've talked about a government of tolerance. Now they've spun us a new "rabbit out of the hat", a special purpose government for a few months, they say, to investigate the wiretapping issue. They're trying to get along with each other, but they don't want each other. And Androulakis wants for Prime Minister an "unknown X" - surprise surprise - whom he will "pull out of the hat", whom he knows but won't tell us. He will tell us after the elections.
