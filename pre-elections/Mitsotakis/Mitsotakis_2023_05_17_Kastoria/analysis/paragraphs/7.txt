Throughout the four years we have had to deal with a very intrusive and aggressive neighbour. I know better than anyone how many difficulties we have gone through. Especially the difficult summer of 2020, when we came "just a breath away" from a hot episode in the Aegean. But we defended our sovereignty and our sovereign rights. We were the ones who - without the support of the opposition - invested in our Armed Forces, and the Rafale is already flying over the Greek skies; our new frigates are already being built. We will take delivery of the first one in 2025. The country is shielded by defence agreements with powerful countries such as the United States and France.
