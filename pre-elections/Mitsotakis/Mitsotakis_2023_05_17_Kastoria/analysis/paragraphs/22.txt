We will fill the jobs lost from lignite with much better jobs, both in manufacturing and in services. Western Macedonia really can and must become a protagonist, so that this demographic trend can be reversed, which unfortunately is a reality and must be of great concern to us. And I would like to remind you at this point that the only party that speaks openly about the demographic problem of the country is us, New Democracy, and we are leaning on the problems of families. We gave 2,000 euros for every child born in our country. We will increase the tax-free allowance by 1,000 euros for every family with a child. We will support civil servants with children by increasing family allowances by EUR 50. We are supporting working mothers with a series of interventions, such as all-day schools, which enable working families to be able to look after their children without having to worry about where to leave them and whether there will be a grandparent to look after them.So we really care about reversing the demographic problem of the country. These policies will not pay off overnight. But we know what we need to do to be able to stop the shrinking of our nation that will have disastrous consequences in the long run.
