So I could say to you today: "look, taking stock of our four years, we had to manage so many crises, we kept Greece's ship safe but we didn't have time to implement our election commitments". I will not do so, because it is simply not true. I told you I would cut taxes and I cut taxes for all and for everyone. ENFIA, the introductory tax rate, the business tax - from 29% to 22% - and a reduction in the advance payment. Eliminate the parental benefit tax for practically everyone, so you can pass on your property to your children and grandchildren without paying it back. Reduce insurance contributions by four points, so important for our businesses that are struggling to become more competitive.
