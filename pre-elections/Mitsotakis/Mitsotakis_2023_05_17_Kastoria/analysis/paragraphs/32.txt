So I ask you, friends, as we are now approaching the end of this very beautiful election period - because for me every election period is very beautiful and always very creative and very meaningful - I ask you to make the last great effort. To claim all those votes that can still be claimed. There is still a percentage of our fellow citizens who in all the polls are declaring themselves undecided. We should say to them "look and see, we may not agree on everything, but let us join together in a broad river of progressive modernisation and creative patriotism".And I would like to address especially here, from Kastoria, our fellow citizens who may be "squinting" towards parties and parties that are moving to the right of New Democracy. To ask them to think about who are the real patriots with deeds and who are the patriots of "fresh water" in words. Because I have defended our national interests with efficiency and dignity, so let us come together to fight this fight. Let us finish strong in the sprint of the last few days. Let us claim all those votes that are still up for grabs, so that - and this is my goal and this is what I want to close with - on Sunday evening there will be absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind: the New Democracy will be the big winner and the one that will govern the country for the next four years.So let us go together for this great struggle, for this great victory, for another victory for the New Democracy, which will start here, from Kastoria, from Western Macedonia. For the Greece we want. Steadily, boldly and only forwards.Be well, thank you very much. Good race, let's go for the final victory.
