This has enabled us - when the economy has reopened - to continue this important growth momentum so that we can be proud today that, yes, our Greece, which has always been treated with such suspicion by our European partners, today we can look at our northern European neighbours and say, "We have higher growth rates than you. We can make reforms that stimulate growth. We can, yes, implement policies that ultimately reduce unemployment and increase jobs. "There is no greater indicator of social inequality than unemployment, especially youth unemployment. I am proud that in these four years we have managed to create almost 300,000 new jobs.

We have many steps to take to make Greece a true investment leader, not only in the Balkans but in the whole of Europe.
