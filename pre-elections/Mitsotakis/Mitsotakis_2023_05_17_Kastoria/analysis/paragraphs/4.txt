I still remember very vividly March 2020, when I was informed that there were tens of thousands of migrants gathering at the border in Evros, organized by Turkey at the time, to invade Greek territory and put pressure on Greece and Europe.We fought a big battle then and we won. Greece protected its borders. It proved that it has borders not only on land, but also at sea and in the air. And we gradually convinced the whole of Europe that no European refugee and migration policy can be effective unless we start from the basic premise that Europe must protect its external borders. In this battle our Greece has been a protagonist.
