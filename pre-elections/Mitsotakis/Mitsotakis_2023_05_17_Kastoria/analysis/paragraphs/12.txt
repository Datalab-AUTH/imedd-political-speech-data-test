But we have also put our programme into practice in many other areas. In education, for example - and I am glad that we have so many young people here, thanks to UNNED, thanks to the GDR, thanks to our youth who are always on the front line - we have freed the universities from the thugs of violence. Because universities belong to the students, to the teachers, not to the hooded men.When I presented our programme in Athens, I used photos behind me to show how I envision the future of our education, and I put a photo of the University of Western Macedonia, from Kozani. I asked the audience if they know where this university is. Most people thought it was abroad. And yet, it is a regional university that is doing a really excellent job, with four departments here in Kastoria, which we want to support - all four of them are excellent - and with a new building for the Mathematics Department; so that our students can come to regional universities and do two things: on the one hand, they can get quality knowledge and on the other hand, they can enjoy a quality of life that they will hardly - especially here in Kastoria - find elsewhere. Of course, they also stimulate the local economy. Because we believe that regional universities have an important role to play in our vision of the education of the future.
