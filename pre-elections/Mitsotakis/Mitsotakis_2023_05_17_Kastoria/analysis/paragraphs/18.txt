At the heart of this programme is maintaining high growth rates, but with a footprint across our country. Because one thing I want to insist on is that I don't want anyone to feel that the growth we are talking about is ultimately not for everyone. This is of particular, special importance for Kastoria, which I know is facing particular problems and particular challenges, both because of the fur industry and because of other structural reasons, so we are talking about growth that can far exceed the European average and which must ultimately have a footprint. And the footprint is measured in terms of more jobs, a significant reduction in unemployment, which will now be close to the European average. But above all its footprint will be better wages for all and for all. A minimum wage that will reach €950 at the end of four years and an average wage that will reach €1,500 at the end of four years. These are achievable targets. With significant management of the new development tools and the substantial resources at our disposal.
