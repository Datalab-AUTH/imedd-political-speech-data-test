Immediately afterwards I took perhaps the most difficult decision, politically, of the whole four years, when I had to literally in one day shut down the whole country against a virus that we were completely unaware of and for which there was no plan to deal with. We closed the country at enormous financial cost. But we stood, and I am proud of this, close to businesses and workers. We paid wages, we paid repayable advances, we kept the productive fabric of our country alive.
