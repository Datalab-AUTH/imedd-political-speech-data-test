So all this is at the heart of our programme. The same applies, of course, to health. Health, my friends, will be the next big bet of the next New Democracy government.In the pandemic we had to play defence, now it is time to play offence. We will recruit 10,000 doctors and nurses over the next four years. We have secured 1.5 billion from the Recovery Fund. These are projects that are already underway that I am talking to you about. Because the Recovery Fund resources must be absorbed by 2026 at the latest.We will rebuild 156 health centres, we will rebuild the emergency departments in more than 80 hospitals. We will support the institution of the "Personal Doctor" and we will place a very strong emphasis on prevention policies, of which I am particularly proud. 500 million will be spent on prevention policies, because these policies are not only economically advantageous. They literally save lives.Especially for screenings, for the women who are with us, for breast cancer, we introduced for the first time a programme, we call it "Phofe Genemata", 1.3 million women, from 50 to 69 years old, received a message from the state offering them a free mammogram. Many women - especially in the periphery - had never had a mammogram in their lives. And of those mammograms we've already done, we've identified more than 7,000 women who have early breast cancer. Their lives will be saved. It's a major intervention. Because if you catch the cancer at the beginning, you can cure it.So when we talk about health, we're not just talking about our hospitals. We are talking about the whole spectrum of health. From healthy eating, from the problems of childhood obesity, to prevention, to primary care, to the Personal Doctor, to our hospitals. And we have a comprehensive plan to really make Greece a country with quality, European health.
