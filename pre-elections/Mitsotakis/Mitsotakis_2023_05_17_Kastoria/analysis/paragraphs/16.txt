It is, you know, very difficult to be able to have a political confrontation with political forces which at the moment, in their desperation, are prepared to feed everything to everyone. And when we asked SYRIZA "come on, guys, let's cost our programmes. You don't believe what we are saying, that the program costs 83 billion, send your program to the Bank of Greece, to the Financial Council of the Parliament, to the General Accounting Office, to have an independent costing. How much do these things you are saying cost? Can the Greek economy afford them?". Silence. Because they simply know that if they did so, their lies and hypocrisy would be exposed once again. And their insufferable populism.
