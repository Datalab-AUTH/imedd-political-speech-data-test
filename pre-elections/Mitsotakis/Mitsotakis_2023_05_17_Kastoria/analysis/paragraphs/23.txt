I also know that the young people want to stay in their place, especially the children of Kastoria here, the children of Western Macedonia. I know that today there are thousands of children who have left Kastoria and have gone to work in tourism. Any job is good and tourism is a good job, but I am sure that you too would prefer to stay here, and work here, and have jobs here, and not be in danger at some point of leaving your home, which you love so much, to seek a better professional future somewhere else. That is my great concern and my great concern for the day ahead.
