So we have been talking throughout this election period about our programme for the Greece of the future. As you remember, we have already been to Western Macedonia several times. We have come once again to present our regional programme for Western Macedonia 2030.The peculiarity of this programme is that for the first time there are projects which are well thought out, costed, with specific implementing agencies. And essentially this is the new contract of truth and accountability which I ask you to sign for the next four years. These are our commitments here for Western Macedonia, for what we want to do, and you have every right, from now on, to ask us for an account if there are delays, if we can or cannot implement this programme. The same applies to our programme on a national scale. For a productive Greece, for a fair Greece, for a green and digital Greece, for a social Greece, for the strong Greece that I envision.
