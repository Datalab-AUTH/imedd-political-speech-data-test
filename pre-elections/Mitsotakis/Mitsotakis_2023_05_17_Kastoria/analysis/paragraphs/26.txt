Two words on energy issues, which are of such concern to us here, especially in the region of Western Macedonia. Greece is already a leader in the green transition. And the reason why we insist so much on having more photovoltaics, more wind, more hydro, more geothermal, is both economic - these forms of energy are cheaper now - and geopolitical. I don't want us to ever again be in the uncomfortable position of being dependent on anyone for energy imports, as has unfortunately happened at European level recently, but I also want everyone, including local communities, to benefit from these projects. That's why the next phase will involve many more rooftop photovoltaics. It will be about photovoltaics for our farmers, so that they can reduce their production costs. Significant investment in our grids so that we can move the energy. And, of course, investment in the future of energy - because we need to plan for it now - which is none other than hydrogen; hydrogen is a way of storing energy from renewable energy sources. And Western Macedonia can become a protagonist in the hydrogen chain, which is already being built in Europe and subsidised, with very significant resources.
