So we have made interventions, friends, in many, many areas. More than 400 bills have been passed despite all these difficulties and what we have finally done, if I had to put it in a sentence, is that we have laid the foundations for Greece to finally change the track. We have secured financial resources that the country has never had available to it before. Our new CIP here, for Western Macedonia, is significantly higher than it was before. The interventions that have been made for the just transition and the resources that are available in total for Western Macedonia are unprecedented for the region. And the next four years will be the four years when these funds will really show their developmental footprint.
