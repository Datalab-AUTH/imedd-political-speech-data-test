Somewhere in all this theatre of the absurd, Mr Varoufakis is lurking and he says, "I am also here to take your euros and turn them into "Demeteras". We say to them: thank you very much, we will not take it. We have seen you, we have tried you, we know you. We don't want to lead the country to disaster a second time.And of course, in the midst of all this, an incredible crescendo of toxicity, vulgarity, mud, misinformation and fake news. I am not surprised. I spent practically my entire speech talking about what I have done and what I want to do. I don't need to spend too much time on our political opponents. After all, you know them much better. I do not need to remind you who Mr Tsipras is.
