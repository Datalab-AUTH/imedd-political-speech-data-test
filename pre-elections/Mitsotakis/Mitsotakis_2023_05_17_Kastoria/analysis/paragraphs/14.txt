Greece has turned into a huge construction site, with large projects, medium projects, small projects, and we are finally managing to "unstick" projects that some people had written off: the Nestori dam, the dam will be built, I have been personally involved, the Klisoura tunnel, important development projects here for your region, natural gas is finally coming to Western Macedonia.I know, we in Crete may have to turn on the radiator very little in winter, but here things are different. We want you to have an alternative source of heating, cheap, because as you can see, gas prices have fallen. And yes, if we need additional financial tools to make it easier for you to change your appliances and be able to install natural gas, we will look at that option as well. As we did for the Savings and Loan programs, with such significant uptake. As we do for the "Change Water Heater" program, which has been "breaking records" and "running out of time" to manage the applications; all of these are important programs. Why? Because they help households reduce their bills, they reduce the energy footprint of households - very important to our overall effort to address climate change - and they support the local economy. Because all this is based on raw materials that are predominantly produced in our country and, of course, they also stimulate the whole sector of the economy. Too many professions are working around these investments that are being made in energy upgrading.
