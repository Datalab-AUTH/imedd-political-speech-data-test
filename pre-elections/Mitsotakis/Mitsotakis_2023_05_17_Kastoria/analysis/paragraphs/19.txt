One of the great challenges and great responsibilities of the next government will be to manage the new NSRF, the Rural Development Programme but especially the Recovery Fund, which is coming and adding â‚¬31 billion to our financial resources. Greece had the largest per capita benefit of any European country from the Recovery Fund, and we negotiated it in the summer of 2020.Of course, this development, as I said, must have a regional and must also have a local dimension. One of the reasons why I wanted to be back in Kastoria was because I wanted to have another meeting with all the fur producers that I had the opportunity to see before. I think that people appreciate the fact that. despite the difficulties, the government stood by them both during the coronavirus and during a crisis for which the people are not to blame, because suddenly their main market, Russia, was closed by a European decision.I want you to know first of all that we will extend the suspensions for three more months, to ensure, in the first instance, the fur workers.
