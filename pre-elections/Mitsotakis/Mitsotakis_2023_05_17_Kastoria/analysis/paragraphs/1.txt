Long live New Democracy. Thank you for this warm welcome.Friends, New Democrats of Kastoria, of Western Macedonia. I wanted to be with you one more time before the elections on 21 May. To take strength from your applause, from your smile, from your enthusiasm, from your optimism. A great blue wave is swelling throughout the country, which will bring us great victors in the elections of 21 May.This depends on the overriding will of the Greek people, but I am sure that on 21 May, our Greece, our party, will be celebrating Constantine and Helen. And of course, Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayors, and Kastoria, a region, a city so identified with the traditional struggles of New Democracy, will also be celebrating.Friends, we have elections in four days from today. I have travelled all over our country. I am back, once again, in Western Macedonia for two reasons: the first - I have already told you - I want to draw strength from a region that has always been at the heart of our party. Kastoria is definitely blue. It was blue, it is blue and it will always be blue.
