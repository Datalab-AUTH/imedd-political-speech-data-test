The country has become a geopolitical factor of stability throughout the Southeastern Mediterranean. It has become a factor of energy security for the whole of Europe.Today it is natural gas, which we import from our ports. Tomorrow it will be renewable energy. The day after tomorrow it will be hydrogen. Greece will be a leading player in the great energy transition that is already taking place. With Western Macedonia at the forefront.And, of course, we did not have enough of this, then we had to manage a war on our continent, an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with terrible consequences for the energy market, with gas prices that went up 10 times. Think about it, 10 times over, it is like paying the equivalent of 15 euros a litre for petrol, let us say, and that is what we had to manage as gas prices, and yet there too we supported society, households. You remember the great concern that existed at the beginning of the crisis with electricity bills. The government came in, taxed the electricity producers and returned the revenue from that tax to each and every one of them individually so that we could contain energy prices.
