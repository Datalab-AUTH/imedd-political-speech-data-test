We will develop a special, well thought out programme with the Public Employment Service on how we can support employment in the wider region of Kastoria. Not only in the fur industry but also in the new professions that will emerge. Because I see that, slowly but surely, Kastoria can and must become a destination 12 months a year, a region which can combine the quality products of the primary sector with a unique cultural heritage and with a unique natural beauty of the city itself, the lake, the wider region, together with the development of the airport, because there is this very large dowry, there is an airport here, which will be developed and highlighted. To make Kastoria really a destination 12 months a year. Other regions of the country with similar natural beauty have achieved this, there is no reason why Kastoria cannot achieve it.
