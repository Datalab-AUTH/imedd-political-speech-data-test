And of course, one more thing that has always been my commitment: support for pensioners. The first pension increases in 12 years were given by the New Democracy government, and I know that this is another great injustice. The injustice is called the personal difference of the Katrougalos law. The next time people claim that they supposedly care about pensioners, please send them the bill at the ballot box, because pensioners do not forget that Mr Tsipras and Mr Katrougalos crushed their pensions.They imposed the personal difference on you and passed the ball of responsibility to fix it to the next government. So hear it clearly: as long as the personal differential exists, especially the low pensioners should know that they will be supported by this government until the personal differential is finally erased.
