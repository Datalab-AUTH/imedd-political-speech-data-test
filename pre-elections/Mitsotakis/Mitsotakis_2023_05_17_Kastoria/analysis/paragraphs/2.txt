There is a second reason, dear George (Kasapidis), Mr.Regional Governor, why I wanted to be here with you today. Because I want you to know that Kastoria has always had a special place in my own heart.I want you to know that just as we have supported Kastoria, despite the great difficulties, these four years, so we will continue to do so in the next four years. We will be close to you, just as we have been close to all the citizens who have been tested for four difficult years now.And as this election period is coming to an end, as I said, I have travelled around the country and I have made a great effort to talk not so much about the past, about what has happened in these four years, but mainly about what we want to do from now on. Because elections are always about our future and elections are always a choice that ultimately affects all of our lives.
