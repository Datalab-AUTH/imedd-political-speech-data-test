And finally, two words about a strong Greece, as I envision it. Friends, Sunday's elections are not only about the economy, local regional issues, health care. They are also about foreign policy and defence. As you have seen, we live in a difficult world, full of contingencies, with constant geopolitical turbulence, with many ups and downs.Who will firmly hold the helm of the country for the next four years is of great importance. Look at what is happening on the other side of the Aegean, in neighbouring Turkey. We always extend a hand of friendship to Turkey. And we want to be able to resolve our basic dispute, which is none other than the delimitation of our maritime zones in the Aegean and the Mediterranean, based on good neighbourly relations and always with international law as a point of reference.But can we be sure that Turkish revisionism will not return the next day? Who, then, is best suited to manage an aggressive Turkey the next day? The one who knows how to build alliances, the one who strengthens the Armed Forces, the one who turns Greek-Turkish issues into Euro-Turkish issues. The one who has proven that in foreign policy crises he can always place Greece on the right side of history and does not seek other geopolitical outlets, which would be extremely dangerous and damaging to national issues.So, yes, the elections that are coming have this dimension as well. The dimension of foreign policy, of continuing to strengthen the country, of continuing our fair but strict immigration policy. I do not want us to return to a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants will enter Greece without any controls. You do not want that either, I am sure of it.
