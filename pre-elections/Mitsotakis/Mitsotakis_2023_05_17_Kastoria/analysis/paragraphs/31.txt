But so be it. None of this matters much, because the dilemmas of the elections have now crystallised. And it's not just the dilemma of whether to keep moving forward or turn back. The simple proportional representation and the criticality of the ballot box on 21 May brings back into the public debate another dilemma which is perhaps even more important. And that is very simple: stability or chaos.The country, today, urgently needs a stable government with a four-year horizon. It does not need unholy party alliances. Factors of instability, factors, I would say, almost bordering on political destabilisation, some of the scenarios that are being circulated; because ultimately our political opponents do not know what they want, because they do not tell us. They cannot agree. We only know what they do not want: they do not want New Democracy and Mitsotakis as Prime Minister. We will not indulge them, friends. The sovereign Greek people will decide, not them. And on Sunday night we will make the "cashier's check" and see who the Greek people finally want.
