So, all this is just a few of the things that we have put into practice during this four-year period. I don't want to talk much more about our report, because I want you to hold back one thing that I think is of particular importance: because elections, as I said, are about the future and not about the past, ultimately the credibility of the main political forces competing for the great privilege, the great responsibility to govern the country is also compared. Can our opponents, I wonder, say the same? Those who would tear up the memoranda 'with a law and an article' and who have saddled us with the third unnecessary memorandum and are now celebrating. Careful, they are celebrating because, he says, they are the ones who got us out of the memoranda they first put us into. They are like the fireman who sets the house on fire and then celebrates because he called the fire brigade and the fire was put out.
