But I want to point out something that made a very big impression on me and I can't help but comment on it. Dionysis Savvopoulos, a great artist, made a political statement. He is a man who does not come from our area, and he has never chewed his words. A man who stood up to the Junta, with anti-dictatorial scrolls, and spoke his mind. His view was that the country needs a self-reliant government and that only New Democracy can guarantee it.He was vilified and targeted in a completely systematic way by SYRIZA and their trolls. Shame, shame, shame. That's all I can say about a party that, when other artists express their opinion in favour of Syriza, they are good, but when anybody else says "you know, guys, the privilege of progressivism does not belong only to the Left, there are other factions that have served the country, here, in this place, and that may be better for the future of our country in this situation", they all come and target and vilify them.
