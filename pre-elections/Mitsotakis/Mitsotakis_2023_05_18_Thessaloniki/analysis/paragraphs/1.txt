Mr President, Mr Regional Mayor, Mr Mayor, Young Democrats of Thessaloniki, of our Macedonia, allow me to call you my compatriots because I am also a candidate for parliament in this city that I love so much. Victory opens from Thessaloniki. This gathering is unique. I called you compatriots because I have not forgotten that I am also a descendant of a Macedonian gladiator, because my grandfather fought in these lands. So, Cretans and Macedonians, we are one. The one that is definitely blue is our Macedonia and Thessaloniki first; this blue wave that starts from the White Tower and Thermaikos and already meets the one that has risen from Chania, from Heraklion, to spread everywhere in our homeland. You have made tonight's gathering the best prologue of Sunday. President, happy birthday, half of Greece is celebrating. But this time democracy will celebrate and the whole country will celebrate.The Sunday that is coming will be the day that will give a second mandate to progress, paving the way for a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. You, the Macedonians, are the first to know how much we have gone through and overcome in such a short time.A big thank you to our ONNED and our GCP, who have always been pioneers in the great battles for quality public universities.
