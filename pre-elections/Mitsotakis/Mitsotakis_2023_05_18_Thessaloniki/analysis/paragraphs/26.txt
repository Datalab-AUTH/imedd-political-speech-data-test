So, at the beginning, SYRIZA wanted Mr Varoufakis next to him, who is planning "Executioners" to make a paper war on deposits. Then, listen, he bet on the government of the losers. This then became the government of the desperate. What is it? A special purpose government that would be, if it ever became a reality, a government of total depression. And the chaos continues.Then came the icing on the cake, as Mr Katrougalos confessed yesterday. What did he tell us? That SYRIZA wants to reintroduce its law on social security, starting with a 20% increase in the deductions for freelancers. And they were quick to "delete" him. Why? Because he was a martyr and revealed the truth. But they still have Pappa and Polakis.
