The same in education, Mr.Rector, 25,000 permanent teacher appointments for the first time in 12 years and 4,000 more to be made this year, 36,000 interactive whiteboards in all schools, from the 5th grade to the 3rd grade.But here the steps must be taken in leaps and bounds. Our universities are now liberated, with the new framework law, to link up with the needs of the labour market. To offer those young children who are struggling so hard to get into public universities a better tomorrow, with better wages and better jobs. This is our stake; these, then, are the demands of the next four years. I will not go into great detail about our programme today, three days before the elections. I have talked about it at length. It is in your hands, it must be owned by everyone.I want you to hold together today four major, central, non-negotiable goals: better wages for all, decent public health for all, an efficient state and a proud homeland. I will outline them in a few words.
