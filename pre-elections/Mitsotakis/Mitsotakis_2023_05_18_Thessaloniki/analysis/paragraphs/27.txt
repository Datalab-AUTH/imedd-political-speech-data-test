They have removed the one who revealed the plan and are holding the others, who have defamed the rule of law. "Buckle up" then. And that's important, which is why everyone who is thinking of abstaining from this election should get up on Sunday and go vote, because the danger of another tax storm is there. But they will not be spared, they will be left alone again, in their miserable and dark world; then they will have everyone and everything to blame. Even Dionysis Savvopoulos, who dared to speak his mind. Maybe because in his lyrics against populism they recognized themselves. Listen, you younger people, to a song that Savvopoulos wrote in 1972, "Angelos hexangelos". "The news he brought us was all a lie, but it sounded pleasant to our ears. For each of his falsehoods seemed like truth and listening to him, our souls were at peace." This is what Dionysis had sung, as if he had written it about Tsipras before he was born.It is a shame that they attacked with vulgarity the beloved Nionios of Thessaloniki and all of Greece. That's why his lyrics answer them again, the ones that suit us. The faces are happy, the eyes are sweetened because they have suffered and now they are learning."
