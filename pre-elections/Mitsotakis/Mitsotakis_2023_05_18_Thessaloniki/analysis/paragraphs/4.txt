So far 50 taxes have been cut, relieving citizens of permanent burdens of more than â‚¬7 billion. I said that ENVIA would be reduced by 30%, we have reduced it by 35%. The tax-free allowance has been increased. The first rate fell from 22% to 9%. The solidarity levy was abolished and we also did something that we had not committed to, which is primarily for this new generation: we zeroed out the parental benefit tax so that parents can now pass on their property to their children free of charge.In 48 months we created 300,000 new jobs and growth in our country is running at twice the rate of Europe. We are now close to investment grade, which in practice means more favourable lending to the state, businesses and households. This investment grade, so critical, my friends, to be achieved, has one condition and one condition only: a stable and reformist government on Sunday. In other words, a New Democracy government.
