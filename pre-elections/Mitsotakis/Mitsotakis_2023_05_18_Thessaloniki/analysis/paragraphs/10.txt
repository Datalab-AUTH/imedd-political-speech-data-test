I will not repeat it, but today I will focus on one intervention in which I believe that everything is reflected, the huge differences that we have with our opponents, the developmental and social dimension of our government's policy, but also my personal vision for Thessaloniki and the entire Region.This intervention is none other than the city's Metro, the most modern and beautiful in Europe. I visited it this morning, and soon you will all be using it. I will not hide from you that I felt a great thrill. We have struggled a lot to get the Metro off the ground. And today we are now absolutely certain that the Metro is becoming a reality, and you see every day the distance between words and deeds. You see the distance between tangible works and painted canvases. But you also see the hypocrisy, that a better everyday transport system would "destroy our ancient treasures".I went to the Venizelos station. Thessaloniki now has both a Metro and an ancient city. Many congratulations are due to all those who worked to make this project a reality. The Metro proves that with planning and hard work any ambitious goal is possible, which ultimately improves the local economy, provides jobs, facilitates first and foremost travel, frees the city from pollutants and finally breaks the isolation between districts, eliminating inequalities.Now that we are delivering the first part of the project - hold on to what I am saying, the first part - the systematic work begins to extend the Metro to north-west Thessaloniki, as I have committed to do; in other words, the Metro is a project that declares who is ultimately truly progressive and who is not. Who is progressive in words and who is progressive in deeds, in actions. We do not talk about our deeds, we talk in our deeds, and that is the big difference between us and our political opponents.
