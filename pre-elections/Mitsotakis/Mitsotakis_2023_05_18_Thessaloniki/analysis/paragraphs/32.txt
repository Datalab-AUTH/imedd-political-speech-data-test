We are the party of Greek women and Greeks who, without party blinkers, want to build a better tomorrow for all. Far from the ideological divisions of yesterday that have faded away. Faithful to the Founding Declaration of Constantine Karamanlis, outside the political barriers that have rusted away. And in this struggle there are no better ambassadors than the Macedonians, than you, who grew up and united Greece.In the end, we were right to decide to hold our rally here, in this glorious stadium of Thessaloniki. I grew up with Nikos Galis and the resurrection of Greek basketball. This is how we start today and the new course for Greece 2030. So let's go together to score the three-pointer of the great victory, for a Greece that is moving steadily, boldly and only forward.High the flags and hearts, all of Greece is looking at us today and we are showing the way. Let's go for the almighty first place. On Sunday, Thessaloniki, Macedonia will be blue, because only our homeland is truly blue.Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Let us go together for the great victory.Be well, have a good fight and we will be here again to celebrate our great victory, the victory of the New Democracy.
