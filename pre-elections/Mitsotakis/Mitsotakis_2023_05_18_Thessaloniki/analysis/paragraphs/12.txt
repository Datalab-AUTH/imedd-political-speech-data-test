A roadmap where the experiences of our first term are integrated into the expectations of our second term. For I am the first to recognise that alongside the great efforts of four years there have been mistakes, and there have been weaknesses to overcome. So the failures of yesterday must become priorities for tomorrow. Because, indeed, if we have done a lot, I am the first to know that there is much more to be done.The economy has come a long way, there have been tax cuts, there have been tax increases. But I know that wages in our country are still low and are being "gnawed" by imported precision.The National Health System has withstood the pandemic. We doubled the intensive care units, hired 18,000 new doctors and nurses, but we still have staff shortages. We have cots and we have long delays, especially in operations; the same is true for the state. Gov.gr has abolished queues. It is a huge conquest, for the way the citizen communicates with the state. And the EFKA, of course, now gives out pensions on time, in two months, not two years. But recent tragedies have come to prove that much still needs to change.
