Tomorrow we complete our own task. Now the responsibility passes to the citizens. We weigh, we decide, we vote. And this responsibility - that is the beauty of democracy - is heavy on the shoulders of each individual citizen. Now there is no room for either frivolity, or hesitation, or dead-end experiments, or so-called protests. We, the Greeks, decide for our Greece. And this is the message that I ask you to carry, the soul of the party in every town, village and home, until the last moment.I repeat, the polls will open on Sunday morning. They will be empty. By the evening they must be filled with New Democracy ballots, ballots that show a party that is strong, that knows how to take Greece forward.
