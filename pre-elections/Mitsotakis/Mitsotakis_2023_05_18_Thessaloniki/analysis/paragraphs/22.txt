Ladies and friends, New Democrats, I will try to be brief. I do not want to talk at length about the hundreds of projects that are taking place throughout the country. About the 'My Home' programme. For the first time, young people are being given the opportunity to be able to imagine a future in which they will own their own homes and not be condemned to rent.I could say a lot about strengthening the family and supporting working mothers, I consider these policies a priority.
