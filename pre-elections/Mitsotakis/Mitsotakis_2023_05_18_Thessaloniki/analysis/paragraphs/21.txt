I believe that these elections are also an opportunity - since we are talking about crucial national issues - to finally distinguish the so-called patriots of "hollow" slogans from the everyday patriots of action and struggle. I say this having met with the Pontian associations this morning, the day before the day of commemoration of the genocide. The Pontians, who are the heart of the north and the locals of the entire homeland, with their lyre keeping alive the history and tradition of Hellenism and their bow always playing the tunes of hope and progress.
