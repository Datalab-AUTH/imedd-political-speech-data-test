It is a shield that on one side has the strengthening of our Armed Forces: 24 new Rafale fighters, 84 upgraded F-16 Vipers, three new frigates - the most modern ships in the Eastern Mediterranean, the first to be delivered by the end of 2025 -, new corvettes, helicopters, armoured vehicles. And, before the end of the decade, the first Greek F-35s. All this alongside our regenerated shipyards and our upgraded defence industry.
