While on the other side of this shield, which we have erected, has the imprints of our active diplomacy: strategic agreements with France and the United States, the extension of our territorial waters to 12 nautical miles in the Ionian Sea, maritime zone agreements with Italy and Egypt and the transformation of Greece into a European energy hub. These are the fingerprints of our active diplomatic policy over the last four years, and of course, with Greece's voice once again being heard loudly everywhere, from the Arab world and capitals around the world to Brussels, and from Israel to the United States Congress.
