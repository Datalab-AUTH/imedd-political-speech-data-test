This becomes crucial as now, three days from today, the time for comparison is coming. We have, on the one hand, an opposition Babel, and on the other hand, on our side, a clear proposal. We have a political absurdity with doses of micromaganism and a rational solution of a safe destination.Because look, in an uncertain international environment - Turkey will have elections in a few days from now - what will be the Greek response? I have not the slightest doubt: I want my country to have a clear horizon in its course and a firm steering wheel in its leadership. The majority of voters, therefore, will not succumb to adventurism, but will join the broad front that believes in responsible patriotism and creative modernisation.
