Today, he is again cutting 83 billion from the money tree and calling - the atheophobe - for "Justice Everywhere". Everywhere except next to him, where he has the 13-0 convict in the Special Court, Nikos Pappas.But not only that, now he threatens us. He is threatening us with pre-trial hearings, as he did with the Novartis collusion. Well, I say to him here from Thessaloniki: we are not chewing the fat, it's a free ride. Let them work hard to lose again.And as we go to the polls, SYRIZA is revealing itself more and more.
