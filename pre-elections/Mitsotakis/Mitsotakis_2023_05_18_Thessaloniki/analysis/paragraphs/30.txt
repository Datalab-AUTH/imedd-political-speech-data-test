Friends, Young Democrats, the question of Sunday is now before us: do we want stability or unknown adventures? Do we want relief and increases or do we want Katrougalos to throw tax raids and cuts back at us 'out of the window'? Do we keep our country safe or make it weak to every threat?In short, do we prefer a New Democracy government and Prime Minister Mitsotakis or a Syriza government and Prime Minister Tsipras? The choice is now in your hands.
