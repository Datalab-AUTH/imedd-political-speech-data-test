Despite the repeated difficulties, at the same time everything we had agreed with the citizens in July 2019 was being put into practice, when - I remember, it was the same day again, the Thursday before the elections - I spoke at the port and asked you to sign a truth agreement.What did I promise you then that we would do? That we would cut taxes and contributions and increase investment and new jobs. That we would shield the average income, support our farmers and agricultural production, upgrade our defence and finally strengthen the prestige of our country. And, finally, I committed to building a digital, citizen-friendly state.So, in our first report, we can look our citizens in the eye and say: 'we have said and done it', despite the great difficulties, despite the crises we had to manage.
