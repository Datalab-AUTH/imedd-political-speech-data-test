Some people - I open a parenthesis - had a reservation when we said where we would hold the meeting. We didn't want to have it outside because it might rain. We say, "Let's go to the Palais. You guys are we going to fill the Palais?" Not just fill it up, it's overflowing with people today and a big thank you all for coming to hear me.
