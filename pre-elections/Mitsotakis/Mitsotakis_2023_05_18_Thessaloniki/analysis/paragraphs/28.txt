The landscape, however, is also blurred by Mr Androulakis, who is asking for what? Not to be the Prime Minister whom the Greeks will vote for, but a third, "unknown X", whom he will appoint. So, he chooses a different path from his friends of PASOK and meets Mr Tsipras in the old party manifestos and attacks against me.I am sorry, but this is something that the democrats of this area, the ordinary voters of PASOK, who, to be honest, I am sure they too feel that they are living better now than in 2019, should think twice and thrice. Who, even if they themselves now see the glass half empty and we see it half full, they know that the glass is neither empty nor broken, as Syriza says. And they refuse to risk what they have conquered to become crutches of the one who until yesterday was their relentless persecutor.They are the ones - and there are many of them - who joined with many others in a great current, which four years ago turned a page in the country. Not all of these citizens, many of whom may not belong to our own party core, want Mr Tsipras and his gang to return with their own vote 'out of the window'. There are Greeks who may recognise that we may have hurt them in some respects, but we have never betrayed them, and we have moved the country forward, despite the great difficulties.
