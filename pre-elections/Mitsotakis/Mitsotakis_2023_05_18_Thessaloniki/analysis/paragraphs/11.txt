This is exactly my plan for Greece of the next day, which is presented in our programme, which I am sure you have all seen by now. For a Greece that is productive, social, just, digital and green - environmentally green, because Greece is blue - just as this beautiful Palais des Sports that hosts us is blue today, just as the whole of Thessaloniki will be blue.And this programme, which, in order for us to be able to implement it, requires that the whole of Greece be blue - because this is the big bet of the elections, that we should be given the opportunity to implement this programme - includes a package of costed measures for four years, amounting to 9 billion, spread over five specific chapters, it's basically a road map for the future.
