Friends, Thessalonikians, Macedonians, I am sure that you too, especially here in Thessaloniki, in the Region of Central Macedonia, see Greece changing around you. You see the huge development potential that the city of Thessaloniki has, the huge projects that are being launched. Never in the history of Thessaloniki has there been such an active interest in completing basic infrastructure projects which the city has needed for decades.The Flyover, which has already been put out to tender, the new cancer hospital, the new paediatric hospital, 17 new schools, new student residences, the redevelopment of this site of the International Fair, the new pier at the port, the Holocaust Museum, the new courts, the sites of the Ziaka and Pavlos Melas camps, our major interventions for Western Thessaloniki.These are just a few of the 30 projects which are specific to the urban complex of Thessaloniki. They are projects that have been launched, final studies have been carried out, they have specific timetables, they have secured funding so that they will be ready, most of them, by 2027. And of course they are part of our development plan for Central Macedonia, which I had the opportunity to present a few months ago.
