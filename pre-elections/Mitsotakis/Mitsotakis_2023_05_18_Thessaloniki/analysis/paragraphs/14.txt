We owe these young people entering the labour market better jobs. The minimum wage will go to 950 euros within four years and the average wage to 1,500 euros.The civil servants' payroll will be increased by 500 million euros from 2024 to support families. There is, you know, a party that is openly talking about the biggest long-standing problem that we have before us, which is none other than the problem of under-generation. We must support the working mother, Greek families. That is why we are increasing the tax-free allowance by EUR 1,000 for families with children; we are reviewing the framework of presumptions, we will reduce them by 30%. We will reduce ENFIA for insured properties by another 10%, and we will reduce contributions by one more point. Finally, we will also abolish the last of the memorandum taxes: within four years, the business tax will be a thing of the past.
