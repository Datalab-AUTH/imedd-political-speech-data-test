So you, friends, know better in Macedonia, in Thrace, the great battles we have been called upon to win in these four years. From the migratory invasions in Evros and the waves of the pandemic, then the energy crisis and the global "explosion" of poverty brought about by the war in Ukraine. And almost daily, for four years now, the threats and provocations of neighbouring Turkey; and yet we have managed, we have stood up and stood together. The state, with a gigantic project that exceeded 55 billion euros, supported the economy, supported society, supported first and foremost the world of work. Three billion, Mr. Regional Governor, was directed here alone to keep the businesses of the Region alive.
