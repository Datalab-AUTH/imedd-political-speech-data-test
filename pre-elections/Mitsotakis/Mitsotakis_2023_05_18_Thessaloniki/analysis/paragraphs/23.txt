But I won't go any further, because today I am in a hurry to talk to you about the political stakes of the most crucial contest of the post-independence period.I want to talk to you about the most ruthless opponents we have, but also about the most threatening "landmine", which is called simple proportional representation. It is a trap of ungovernability. It can take many forms. It can take the form of national weakness, or the appearance of collective paralysis, even if it could take the nickname of a misguided cooperation.And I'll explain: Syriza is asking for revenge, while it has failed as a government - you know that - but it has also failed as an opposition. It has saddled us with a third unnecessary memorandum, with 29 taxes and 17 pension cuts. But keep in mind that as an opposition he also said 'no' everywhere. "No", basically, to armaments and defence agreements, "no" to the fence, "no" to increases, and even "no" to the rights of our disabled citizens. And of course 'no' to the exclusion of the Golden Dawn cutthroat. He did not go along with the great democratic arc that we tried to build.
