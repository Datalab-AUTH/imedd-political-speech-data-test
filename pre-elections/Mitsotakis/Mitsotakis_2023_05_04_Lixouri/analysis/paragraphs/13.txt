I committed to three very simple things when I asked for your trust in 2019. I told you that I wanted to reduce taxes and contributions and, yes, I reduced taxes and contributions for every Greek woman and every Greek man. You all know this better than I do. I told you that I want to create jobs and put the country on a dynamic growth path and bring in investment. In Kefalonia alone - look, I was looking at the figures - there are investments of 150 million. Most of them in the tourism sector, but not only. And arrivals last year were 10% higher than in 2019 and this year is expected to be even better. This is income for the whole island and to support the overall economy of the island. Not only for tourism, for the primary sector, for cultural activities. Because that is how we understand regional development. So I have also kept this commitment.
