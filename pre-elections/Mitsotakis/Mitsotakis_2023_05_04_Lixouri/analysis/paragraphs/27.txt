We will be pleasantly surprised by the outcome of the elections. I sense it wherever I go, the dynamism of the people, the need at this moment to rally with us and citizens who have not supported us in the past. There are many of them. Wherever I go, I see our fellow citizens who come to me and say: 'we had not voted for New Democracy in the past, we will do so now for the first time'. And that is a vote of confidence in me personally and in our government. And I am sure that Kefalonia will also send a strong message on the evening of 21 May: boldly, firmly, forwards, with New Democracy as the protagonist. Independent New Democracy, for a strong, independent Greece. Thank you very much. Good strength and good fight. 17 days left. Be well. Thank you very much.
