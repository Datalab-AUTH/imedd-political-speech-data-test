The same applies to the hospital in Argostoli, which I had the opportunity to visit on my previous visit. I was pleased to learn that the new emergency departments are already in operation and are exemplary. Why am I saying this? Because, you see, we intend to invest in public health as a whole. It is a central commitment of mine that the next four years will be a four-year period of substantial recovery of the NHS, and that of course means that you must be able to access quality health care wherever you are, depending on the structures that we have, which we must support. And as part of a very ambitious programme, which includes many more recruitments, we will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors over the next four years to meet the needs of the National Health System. With extra resources for our hospitals, for our health centres. What has already been done in Argostoli, the modernisation of the emergency departments, the first point of contact between the citizen and the hospital, will be done in 80 hospitals in the country, and 156 health centres will be able to be completely renovated.
