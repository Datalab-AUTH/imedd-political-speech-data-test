I want you to know that never before has the state moved faster to repair the damage. I am not saying that we did everything perfectly, I am not saying that everything was done at the pace and speed that citizens might have expected. But we have certainly achieved a significant improvement in the state's response, so that citizens and local government know that when a major natural disaster strikes, the state will ultimately be there to help.
