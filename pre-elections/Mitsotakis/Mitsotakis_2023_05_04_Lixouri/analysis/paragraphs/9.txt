I have spoken to you, as you can see, about our plans for the future, because I would really like this election campaign, until it ends on 21 May, to be a campaign in which we can really talk about the future and not about the past.  I am not interested at this moment in getting into any confrontation with our party opponents. Everyone is being judged. Mr Tsipras presented his programme yesterday. I believe that he has as much credibility as everything he has said in the past. People remember very well what he said in the past and what he did in the end.
