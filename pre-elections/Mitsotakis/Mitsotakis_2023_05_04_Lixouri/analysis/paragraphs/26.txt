And, finally, whether we are satisfied with this course of the country. Whether we want stability, certainty, to be able to look to the future with confidence, or whether we want to embark on adventures and experimentation. Because what I see today is that there is only one clear proposal for governance: New Democracy strong and victorious in the May 21 elections; no other alternative seems convincing. We have a proposal, and we put it to the Greek people's judgment. We ask to be evaluated for our work and our plan.I am sure that the Greek people will trust us again. And I am sure that the citizens of Kefalonia will again give us the single mandate of Kefalonia, with a greater margin than the one we had in 2019, just as I am sure that we will win all nine single mandate elections and that the map of our country will become blue overall and we will be able to make pleasant surprises where we were not first in the previous elections.
