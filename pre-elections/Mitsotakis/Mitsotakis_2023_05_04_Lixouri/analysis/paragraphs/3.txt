Mayor, indeed, I think you're right when you say that we have dealt with the problems of local government - this is a regional government - without looking at colours. We supported the municipalities and the regions, because we know very well that you are the first point of contact between the citizen and the state. And if you have sufficient financial tools, you will be able to make the lives of your citizens better.Kefalonia was hit by a series of disasters, the wounds of the 2014 earthquake were unfortunately not healed by the previous government with the speed they should have been and of course we had to add to this an unprecedented natural disaster, that of Janos.
