Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this very warm welcome. The last time I visited your beautiful island I was unable, due to pressure on my schedule, to come and see you in Lixouri. I had, however, committed myself then that on my next visit I would come to shake your hand and talk to you. And as you know, I have kept my commitments, I am with you today and I thank you for your warm response.
