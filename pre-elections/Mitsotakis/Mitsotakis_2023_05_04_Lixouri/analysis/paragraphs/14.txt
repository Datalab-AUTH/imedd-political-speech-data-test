My third commitment was that I want a strong and secure country. A country that protects its borders. We have protected the borders of the homeland effectively. Our homeland is no longer a "no man's land". We have, I believe, represented the country abroad with dignity, we have claimed European resources, which will be able to make a big difference in the years to come. 31 billion Recovery Fund, I personally negotiated it. Not 17 hours, five days, but I secured EUR 31 billion for the country, and this money is working everywhere.
