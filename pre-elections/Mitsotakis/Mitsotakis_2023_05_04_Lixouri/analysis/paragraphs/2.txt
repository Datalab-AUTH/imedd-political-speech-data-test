The President commemorated the historical relations of my father, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, with Kefalonia. It is true that his closest associate was the late Nikos Linardatos, who always spoke with great love for his country and I believe that he also contributed to many things that happened at that time. However, I want you to know that today you have before you a man who loves Kefalonia deeply, as I have spent more than ten summers here. From the age of 18 at least until I was 30, I used to come to Kourkoumelata for holidays with very good friends from the island and I have, I believe, a very good knowledge of the problems and the important development opportunities that exist here in Kefalonia.
