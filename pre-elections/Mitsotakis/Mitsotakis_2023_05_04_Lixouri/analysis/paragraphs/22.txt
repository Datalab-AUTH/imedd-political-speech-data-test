All these are the real problems of the citizens. And it is these problems that we need to talk about, not the many procedural things that journalists ask us.You know, I often go to interviews and we are asked about various issues and I wonder, after all, are the things that journalists ask us about the things that are of concern to society? The answer is no. What you are concerned about is how you will have a better income, how your children will have better jobs, what will happen with health here in Lixouri, in Argostoli, how you will feel when you go to a hospital and have a decent access to health care. What the farmer will do with his harvest. What will happen if a natural disaster hits us on the head.
