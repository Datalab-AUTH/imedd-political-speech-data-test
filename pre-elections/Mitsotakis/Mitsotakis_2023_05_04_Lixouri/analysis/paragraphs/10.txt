We want to be judged independently for what we have done this four years and for what we want to do in the next four years. And indeed, the President was right when he said that we have had a lot in this four-year period. And certainly when I was elected Prime Minister of this country in July 2019, I could not have imagined that during my tenure I would have to deal with a pandemic, an immigration invasion, a war in Ukraine, an imported crisis of insecurity. We had a lot of things happen to us, but I'm proud because we kept the country safe, we kept the country's steering wheel stable, and Greece is in a much better shape today than it was in 2019.
