We are now one of Europe's leaders in growth and I am very proud of that. Our economy is doing well and will do better, and as our economy does well and will do better, there will be more money for education, for health, for welfare, for supporting people with disabilities. That is our central bet and that is what we have been able to do and we have achieved it despite the difficulties. We have implemented our election programme despite the great and difficult things that have happened to us.
