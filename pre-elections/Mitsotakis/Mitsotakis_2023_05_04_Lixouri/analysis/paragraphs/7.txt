Among the interventions, I repeat, that we will support is the complete modernisation of your hospital here in Lixouri. But it is not only the interventions that we want to make in health care. We are well aware of the issue of workers' housing and I believe that we have initiated a solution to a problem that has been lingering. There are other issues that we need to address. We will very soon complete the dredging of the harbour. We need, as I understand it, a desalination plant that can ensure that you have sufficient quantities of water, drinking water for the general needs of your municipality.
