So, we are approaching this electoral battle today with the certainty that we have been consistent in our commitments and that is why when we talk to you about our programme for the next four years we are very confident that we can deliver.Our central commitment is simple: we want the economy to grow much faster than the European average, we want to achieve a 25% increase in wages in four years and we can do it. Just as we raised the minimum wage from €650 to €780, we can take it from €780 to €950 over four years.
