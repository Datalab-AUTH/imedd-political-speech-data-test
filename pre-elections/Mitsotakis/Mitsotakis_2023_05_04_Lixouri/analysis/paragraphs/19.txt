We said from the very first moment that we would redress the injustices that have been done. But be careful, you will not hear from me any commitments that I cannot implement the next day. It would be very dishonest to come here and tell you things that I know cannot be done. And it is doubly insulting, I think, for the people, those who cut your pensions, cut the middle class and slashed their taxes, to come here now and say that they are going to do the exact opposite of what they did in the last four years.But, again, I said, I am not interested in getting too involved in what Syriza is saying, I am interested in putting more emphasis on what we are going to do.
