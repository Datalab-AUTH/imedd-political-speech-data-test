And, of course, to make a special mention of our policies for our most vulnerable citizens. For the first time the country has a coherent plan for people with disabilities - it has never had it at the level of horizontal policies - which we are implementing, overcoming chronic difficulties. You know how important the Personal Assistant is for people with severe disabilities. You know better than I do, the burden that is placed on a family who will now be able to have a person next to the person with a disability, to help them, but also for the disabled person to be able to build their life, to claim their own ambitions.All these are very important programmes. Supported living shelters everywhere where we need them, because there is no greater stress than a parent who has a child with a disability knowing that somehow that child can be safe in the event that the parent passes away.
