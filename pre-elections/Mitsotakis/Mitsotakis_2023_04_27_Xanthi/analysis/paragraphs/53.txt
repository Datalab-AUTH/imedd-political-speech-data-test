Our goal by 2027 is to have 80% of the country's electricity generation from the sun, wind and other forms of Renewable Energy Sources. It means that we will not be dependent on anyone who threatens to cut off our gas. It means that we will no longer be in the financially uncomfortable position of having to pay 7 billion a year, as much as we paid in 2022 to import gas, because gas prices have soared; but it means cheap and clean energy for businesses and households. Let me give two examples again from the businesses I visited today. Thrace Greenhouses has a unique patent. They produce energy with geothermal energy. This essentially means that energy is turned into a comparative advantage. And I will support the Region and all investments that will take advantage of Thrace's important geothermal fields; we have more programs for "rooftop PV" and PV for our farmers. Small photovoltaics so that energy is not a disadvantage, it becomes an advantage for you.
