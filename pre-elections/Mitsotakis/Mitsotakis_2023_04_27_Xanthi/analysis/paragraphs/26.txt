What I want to stress is another thing: that both the investment grade and your positive effects, as I said, have a precondition. What is that? Political stability. And the presence of a government that will continue the growth trajectory that we have achieved these last years. And, of course, which only one development can guarantee: the second term of office of New Democracy at the helm of the country. A term of office with such strength that it will allow it to implement its programme without hindrance.
