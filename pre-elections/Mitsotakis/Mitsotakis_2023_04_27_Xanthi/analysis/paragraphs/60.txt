I have never heard greater gibberish than what Mr Tsipras said today on immigration policy. Well, we are clean. We want to protect our borders. We want to limit the migration flows. We will work with Europe to ensure that illegal immigrants are returned to their countries of origin. We have integration policies for those who are granted asylum in our country. They are welcome and we want to integrate them into the Greek state and Greek society, but we are not going to step back from our position, which has now become a European position, that any European immigration policy starts with guarding our borders. Our borders are also European borders and we will guard them in the most effective way possible.
