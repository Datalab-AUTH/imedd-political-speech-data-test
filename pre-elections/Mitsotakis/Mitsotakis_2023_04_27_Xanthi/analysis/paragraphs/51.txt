When we did a major restructuring that produced results in the EFKA, I said to the EFKA management, "Very well, I will give you additional resources for those employees who are performing better and making more pensions." And by magic, the EFKA came into order and we solved the long pending issue of not having to wait two and three years, but in two months your pension finally comes out. By 2027 the state will be 100% digital. What you see with gov.gr is just the beginning.
