Here, to our north is Bulgaria. Five elections in two years with a simple proportional representation system are not making any sense. They are heading for a sixth ballot, and it is doubtful whether a government will emerge from it.I ask you, do we need such political instability in the country? The answer is one: No, we need a clear horizon on the way, a clear solution in the leadership.
