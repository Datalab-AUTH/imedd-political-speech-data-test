And for our youth, for our young people, let me tell you how pleased I am with the tremendous response so far to the "My House" programme.How many young people have rushed to find homes that can be included in the programme. They will acquire them with a low-interest loan from a bank, subsidized by the Greek state. They will, in other words, pay much less for the loan instalment than they would pay to rent an equivalent house. Only that eventually, after a few years, they will own the house. 20 000 beneficiaries - because the budget of the programme will be doubled - will be able to benefit from this programme.
