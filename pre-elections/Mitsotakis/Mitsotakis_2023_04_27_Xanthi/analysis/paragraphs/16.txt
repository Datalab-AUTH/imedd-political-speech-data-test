In July 2019, however, I committed myself not only to a safe Greece, but also to a country with lower taxes, with more investment and jobs, with better income, with care for the weakest, in an easier and more digital everyday life and with our national voice finally being heard on an equal footing abroad.So I ask you: have we met all these goals after four years? My answer is yes, we have said and done it, despite the great difficulties we have had to face.
