That's it. You know, that's the state we want. This is the state that I envision. And it is precisely on this overcoming of delays, on a dynamic perspective for the country that the programme for the next four years is based, which I had the opportunity to present yesterday at a different event from the usual ones. I encourage you, if you have not seen it, I think you will find it interesting, because we basically outline measures that are included in five major chapters on how I envision a productive, social, fair, green, digital Greece.  I always stress this to avoid misunderstandings: green, environmentally green, blue political.
