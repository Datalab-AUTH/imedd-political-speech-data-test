But also to the state. Yes, we have made great strides. gov.gr is a revolution for all and for everyone. It's hard to imagine your life how it was before gov.gr, how we stood in queues to process our easiest transaction with the state. Today, all this is done without queues, without hassles.But I know very well that at the same time, in some other part of the public sector, the trap of anachronism and "ochodermism" is lurking. Unfortunately, we have seen this in the Tempi accident.We must therefore cancel out these negative aspects of the state and generalise the good side, the positive side of the state. Because, yes, we very often complain about the things we do not like about the state and we are right and we must correct them.
