On health, let me tell you how important it is to complete the recruitment of 10,000 nurses and doctors as soon as possible. Most of them are people who are serving in the health care system and will be made permanent through the advertisements that are already running, and I know that many of our hospitals are not in the condition we want them to be in. Especially the emergency departments. We're going to upgrade 80 hospitals and 156 health centers with Recovery Fund resources. And we will expand free screenings for all citizens and for all major diseases.
