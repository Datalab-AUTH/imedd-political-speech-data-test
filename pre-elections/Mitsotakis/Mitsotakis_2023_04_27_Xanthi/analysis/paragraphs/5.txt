Mr. Regional Governor, from Ormenio to Gavdos, from Kastelorizo to Othoni, the blues of truth, certainty and progress. The blues that will signify a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. Especially you here in Evros, in Rodopi, in Xanthi, in Kavala, in Drama, you know that we have gone through successive difficulties in order to get here.You, our Greeks, remember well the migratory invasions in Evros and the Aegean. Almost at the same time as the storm of the global pandemic, which lasted for more than two years. Immediately afterwards, the war in Ukraine, the international energy crisis, a global inflationary explosion that also hit our economy. Natural disasters, while resisting and resisting the daily threats from our neighbours; but we did it, our borders remained impregnable. They are now established as the eastern border of Europe. And with a huge programme that exceeded 50 billion euros, the state supported households, businesses, protected jobs.
