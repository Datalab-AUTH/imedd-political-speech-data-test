The electoral victory of New Democracy is therefore not only a party expediency. It is a national necessity. One question will ultimately be the question on 21 May: do we move forward or do we turn back? This dilemma has many facets. Do we want results or do we want lies? Do we want taxes and cuts again or do we want increases and good pay? Do we want firmness or lightness? Do we want a Prime Minister who will be appreciated by foreign leaders or someone behind whom they can hide?In the end, all versions come together in one: do we want New Democracy with Prime Minister Mitsotakis or do we want Syriza with Prime Minister Tsipras?
