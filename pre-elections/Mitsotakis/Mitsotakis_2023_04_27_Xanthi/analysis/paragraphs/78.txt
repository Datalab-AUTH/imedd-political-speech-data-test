So, what is there against the proposal, today, for the governance of New Democracy? I see a chaos. Forces without principles; forces that if they could - have no doubt - would want to join forces even if they were defeated. This "monstrosity" that I spoke about, the government of SYRIZA - PASOK - Varoufakis with Prime Minister Tsipras, in exchange for the consolidation of proportional representation, is certainly on their minds.And they have now discovered a new patent, after the government of the defeated. We now have, they say, a government of tolerance. That is not tolerance. This is about guilt.
