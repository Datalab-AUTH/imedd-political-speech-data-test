Our national economy - note, this has a special significance - has been upgraded 12 times. It is now half a step away from regaining investment grade status. And you will say to me, why does this concern the average citizen? I will tell you why. Because once we get investment grade, the state, businesses and citizens will be able to borrow cheaper. And that will help everyone and everything. The businesses operating in the region, the households, the small and medium sized businesses. And I personally guarantee that as soon as a stable and strong government of the New Democracy emerges after the elections, we will obtain the investment grade before the end of 2023. I guarantee it.
