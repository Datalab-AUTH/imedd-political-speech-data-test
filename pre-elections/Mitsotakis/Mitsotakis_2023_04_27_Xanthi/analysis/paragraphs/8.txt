And of course, in the same period, recognizing the fact that our Armed Forces for a decade have been substantially underinvested, we have steeled our national defense.I was on a tour of Boeotia on Tuesday, the day before yesterday, and while I was speaking in Schimatari, I was listening to the Rafale taking off from Tanagra. Twenty-four we will have by the end of the year. Along with 84 upgraded F-16s. Yesterday, at the presentation of our programme, among the many photos I showed was one that I was very moved by. It is the first Belharra frigate, which is being completed in the French shipyards and will be delivered to our Navy in 2025.
