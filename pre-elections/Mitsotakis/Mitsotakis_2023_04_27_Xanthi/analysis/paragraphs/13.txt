And externally, it is based on the rules of international legitimacy and good neighbourly relations between states. Fellow party members, friends of Xanthi, from here, from this place where Christians and Muslims live peacefully under the European umbrella of the Greek citizen, I am addressing our neighbours with sincerity.I want to tell them that our relations should not be subject to the intensity of the election battle. We are both heading towards national elections.We must also not be poisoned by myths about the religious minority in Thrace. I do not think there is any of our fellow citizens who would ever want to become a tool of other agendas.On the contrary, the Turkish leadership would do well to understand that reality does not change by falsifying history and conditions. Nor by arbitrarily painting on the map in red islands and areas that were, are and will always be blue.
