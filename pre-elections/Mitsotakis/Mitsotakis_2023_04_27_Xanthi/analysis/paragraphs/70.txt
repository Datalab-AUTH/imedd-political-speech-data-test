So the opposition is dishing out grey and disaster. I want to remind you that - as my colleagues in Parliament remember - it said no to everything and yes to nothing. It voted no - listen to this - to tax cuts; it voted no to an increase in the minimum wage; it voted no to armaments, no to defence agreements, no to the Evros fence, no even to the rights of our fellow citizens with disabilities. He voted no to the protection of the Parliament from the 'straw men' of Golden Dawn.
