We will put a strong emphasis in the second four years, friends, on justice. Justice is slow, we all know that. It is inconveniencing citizens, it is inconveniencing businessmen. I have a goal and a measurable result: Within four years we must approach the European average in the administration of justice. We will achieve this goal too.
