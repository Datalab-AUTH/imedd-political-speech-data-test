Look, we're not going to indulge them. Close doors, windows and cracks to these governments of guilt and tolerance, to their plans for a "rag and bone" government; and with your vote, close the way to any possible collaboration that will bring paralysis. Tomorrow's government cannot be held hostage to partisan bargaining. Nor can decisions be lost in endless negotiations.
