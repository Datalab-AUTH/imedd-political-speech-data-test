But the state is also the mechanism that organised an exemplary vaccination campaign, Operation Freedom. The state is also the EMAK, the ambulance service and the border guards. The State is the Civil Protection. We fought so many difficult fights in the fires, you remember them well, the difficult fire we had in Dadia last summer. The state is also the '112', which helps us in natural disasters. 112, which has been working in our country - and I would like to say this - for three years now in an exemplary manner. We all now know that when that sound rings, we must look at our phone and read the message that the Civil Protection Service is sending us. Now, just now, in the UK, they are experimenting. They will have it a year from now. We have had it, already, for three years; State is our pilots and our Special Forces who flew to Sudan - and are returning right now - to rescue our compatriots. They went and flew into a war zone and are returning safely.And the State, of course, is also the mechanism - and I am addressing women in particular here - that has so far alerted 130,000 Greek women to have digital preventive mammograms. For the first time, the state is going to the citizen, not waiting for the citizen to come to the state.
