And what are they betting on now? On simple proportional representation. After winning two elections with enhanced proportional representation in order to govern with Mr. Kamenos, they leave behind them a "mine" to hit New Democracy. But a mine that I deeply believe threatens both our democracy and the country with ungovernability, which is exactly the opposite of what the country needs today. Because in an uncertain international environment, with an unpredictable neighbour by our side, we need certainty, continuity and perspective more than ever.
