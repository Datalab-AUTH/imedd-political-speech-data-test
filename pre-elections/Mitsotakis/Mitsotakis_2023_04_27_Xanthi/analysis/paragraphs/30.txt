At last, this project, so critical, the Iasmos Dam is moving forward. The major road projects involving the Xanthi region: Sminthis - Echinos, the axis for the Greek-Bulgarian border, Drama - Amphipolis, Drama - Agios Athanasios. And, of course, all these are steps to bring new investments to the region, to fight unemployment in the mountainous areas, because, as you know, isolation is also a form of injustice when it deprives you of work.
