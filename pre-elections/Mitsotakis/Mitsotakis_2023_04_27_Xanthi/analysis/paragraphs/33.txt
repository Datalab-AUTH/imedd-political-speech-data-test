See, for example, health. Despite the pressure on the National Health System during the pandemic, it held up. We doubled the intensive care units, we hired almost 18,000 health workers, more than 1,000 here in your own region; we have already increased by 10% the salaries and allowances of those fighting on the front line in health care. But our health care is still sick, has been for decades, and is far from what we want, especially in hospitals, especially in primary care.
