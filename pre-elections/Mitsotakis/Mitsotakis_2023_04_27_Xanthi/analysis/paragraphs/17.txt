Today, citizens have been relieved of more than fifty taxes, the rate on individuals, the import tax, has fallen from 22% to 9%. I am repeating all this, you know, because we are in danger of taking it for granted.ENFIA, when I came here to Thrace and told you that we would reduce it by 30%, we reduced it by 35%. The solidarity contribution was abolished. The parental benefit tax has been abolished. Every parent can finally transfer property to their children free of charge. Seven, mind you, seven billion in permanent taxes have been taken off the backs of households and businesses.
