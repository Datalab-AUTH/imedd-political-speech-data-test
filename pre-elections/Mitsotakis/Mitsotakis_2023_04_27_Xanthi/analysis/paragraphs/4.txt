Everybody now recognises that four years we have been laying the foundations of the country we want. As I said yesterday in the presentation of our programme, we have laid the foundations, we have built the first floors and now we are continuing the effort to raise the country we deserve even higher. To complete this renaissance by taking our rightful place in the whole of Europe. That is why it is so important in this election to say no to a second mandate for disaster, yes to a strong second mandate for progress. And just as we once fought together to stay in Europe, now our goal is "to be Europe", all of us and in everything. And Xanthi and Thrace, I can see it in your faces, will again be on the front line. You will wrap both the city and its villages in our blue colours. And on the evening of 21 May the whole territory will be dressed in blue.
