And the Mayor and all the Mayors in the country are well aware that never in the last forty years have there been more resources available, either for the Region or for Local Government, to do major infrastructure projects. From the biological treatment plants that are so important here in your region and of course for Lake Mornos, to the planning of major infrastructure projects that will bring every corner of our country out of isolation. That is my goal. The young people-I see that you have a lot of youth here in your villages and that makes me very happy. If the youth are to be able to stay in their villages and in their homeland, they need first and foremost good education and then good jobs. I ask you today if there is another party in the country that has a clear plan on how we can take Greece forward.
