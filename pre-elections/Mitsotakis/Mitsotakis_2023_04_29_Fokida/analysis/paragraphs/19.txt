And, of course, let's not forget. We reduced taxes for every Greek woman and every Greek man. I told you that we would reduce ENFIA by 30%, we reduced it by 35%. I told you an introductory tax rate of 9%, we went to 9%. I told you about farmers - because I attach great importance to this - that I would reduce the tax on cooperatives by 50%. Because we want our farmers to cooperate. We have returned the excise duty to the farmers.
