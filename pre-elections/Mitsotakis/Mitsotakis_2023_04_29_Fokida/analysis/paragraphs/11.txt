So today, friends, New Democracy has a plan for the Greece of the next day. We have credibility, because what we told you during the election we did. And we have the experience of a tried and tested government. Four years we have been through a lot, as I said.  We have kept the country standing. Greece today is stronger. And a more confident country.
