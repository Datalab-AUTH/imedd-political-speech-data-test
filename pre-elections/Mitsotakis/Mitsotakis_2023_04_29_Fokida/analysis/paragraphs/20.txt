In other words, we did everything we could and everything we could bear to support society. That is what we will continue to do. We will not make fun of you. We will tell the truth. Greece will be on a growth path. And here in Dorida, you will send your own message that we will be the big winners in the elections on 21 May. Be well. Thank you very much. Goodbye. And give me the opportunity to be Prime Minister again. I'm the first sitting Prime Minister to visit your municipality. May I be Prime Minister again in the next four years, so we can come back here and talk again. Thank you very much. Good luck.
