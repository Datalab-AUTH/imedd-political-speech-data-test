We have overcome unprecedented crises, we have kept society on its feet, we have kept Greece on its feet, we have put the economy on a growth track and at the same time, despite the great difficulties, we have also implemented all our central pre-election commitments, and I am extremely proud of that.In 2019, I looked you in the eye and asked you to sign a truth agreement. I pledged to you that I would reduce taxes and contributions, that I would support growth, that I would create jobs, that I would support the primary sector, that I would turn Greece into a major construction site, that I would protect the borders of the country, that I would support the Armed Forces.And I ask you if there is a single one of these pledges that we have not put into practice. We have fully implemented our 2019 election programme. And at the same time we managed a series of unprecedented crises.
