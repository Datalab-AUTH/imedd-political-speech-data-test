For a homeland that is truly strong. A country that can move forward with confidence and with certainty.I would like to ask you and I would like to ask especially our party executives, throughout this election period, to respond to the demands of the democratic process with confidence and with decency. Why do I insist on decorum? I do not want us to be accused in any way of sinking the political debate into toxicity and division. We have no reason to do so; we have work that we want to promote, but above all we have a plan for the next day that we want to talk about. We can talk about the present and the future of our country. Because we know very well where we want to take Greece.
