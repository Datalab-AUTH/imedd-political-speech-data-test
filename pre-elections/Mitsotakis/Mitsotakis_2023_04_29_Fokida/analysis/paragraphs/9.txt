What we commit to we know we can deliver. How to raise wages more. We know which taxes we want to cut, we know how we can support the primary sector. And since you are talking to me about the primary sector, because I am in a region that is primarily agricultural and we are talking about our relations with Europe, you know, I would like to remind you that I am the one who managed to negotiate a rural development programme for the country, without any loss for our farmers and livestock farmers. A new NSRF for the region as a whole. It was just over 190 million in your Region's NSRF and through our own negotiations we took it to 426 million euros. These are projects for everyone. It is at the discretion of the Regional Governor and the Region how to allocate them.
