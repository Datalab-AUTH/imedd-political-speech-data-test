Three days ago, I presented our plan for Greece 2027 in an event that lasted an hour and a half - it's worth watching - and it's a plan that is well thought out, it's costed, it emphasises all the areas where our country has comparative advantages. It is a plan that has secured funding and, above all, it is a realistic plan. The last thing I am going to do, friends, is to look you in the eye and tell you things that I know cannot be done.  I am invested in political credibility. I'm not going to back away from the truth deal that we have signed.
