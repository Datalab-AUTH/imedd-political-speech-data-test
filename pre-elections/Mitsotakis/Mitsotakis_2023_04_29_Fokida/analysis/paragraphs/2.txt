Friends, I have started this march in this election period and my intention is to tour every corner of our country. You see, we are not letting a day go by; some others are having leisurely three days, we are going from village to village, from town to town, to carry the message of victory. But above all to talk about the future of our country and about what the great stakes of the May 21 elections are.Because we say every time, in every election, that every election is crucial. But I would say that this election has a special significance, a special criticality. For the simple reason that four years together, united, state and society, we have achieved and accomplished a great deal.
