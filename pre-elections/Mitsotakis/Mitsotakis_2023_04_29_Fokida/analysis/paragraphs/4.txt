When the Greek people put their trust in me, in July 2019, I could not have imagined how many difficulties we would have to face. From the refugee invasion of Evros in March 2020, to the pandemic crisis, from a neighbour who was constantly causing problems in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, to now, the imported crisis of insecurity as a result of Russia's war of invasion in Ukraine. If we had not spent more than EUR 50 billion to keep society and the economy on its feet during the coronavirus, we would be in a much more difficult situation today.
