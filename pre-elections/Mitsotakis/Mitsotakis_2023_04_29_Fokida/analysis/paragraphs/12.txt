And what exactly do we have in front of us? We have a party and a leader who, in his eagerness to sound pleasant to the citizens, took his election programme which he had announced and which cost 45 billion and added another thirty billion or so, to tell us that he was going to do what exactly? Is he going to blow the house down?  Is he going to lead the country into new memoranda again? Who can really believe today that the Greek economy can withstand a 70 billion programme? Because that's what all the things that Mr Tsipras is telling you cost. "Ares - mares pine cones", I reply. I am not concerned, friends, with what the opposition says.  But elections are a comparison.  Two parties are currently contesting the election. And two are the prime ministerial candidates. Either Mitsotakis and New Democracy or Tsipras and Syriza. We know very well what the citizens, especially the citizens of Doris, will respond to the elections on May 21. They will enable us to continue our work and to work methodically and systematically for the well-being of you and all of us.
