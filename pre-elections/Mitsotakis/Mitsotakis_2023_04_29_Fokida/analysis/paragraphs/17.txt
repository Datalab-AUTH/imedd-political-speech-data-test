So I want to - just a moment because I am listening to the lady here who is very active and she is telling me something which is interesting and to which I want to respond. Because the purpose here is to have some interactive discussions.She says to me: "Reduce VAT". So watch out. VAT can be reduced at some point, but only when we are sure that it does not blow up fiscal stability. Also know - and listen to this, because I have discussed this with many of my counterparts in the European Union - many countries that have tried to reduce VAT to keep prices down - it was done in Spain - have found that it had no effect on inflation because the money simply stayed with the producers and the production chain itself.It is not at all a given that reducing VAT has an effect on final prices. That is why we did not opt for it. And instead, we chose to support citizens, with a series of tools - you know them and I think you know them - and at the same time we chose to intensify controls on the market to avoid any kind of obscenity.
