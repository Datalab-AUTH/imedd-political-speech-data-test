And we will be the winners to close every crack, every door, every window to possible "political monstrosities" that can arise from coalition governments without the first party.I will say it again here. I hear Mr. Tsipras saying that: "I am not interested in making a government of losers". I do not believe a single word he says. If the beans were to come out, SYRIZA, PASOK, the MP25 of Mr Varoufakis and Demeter could well be in coalition, with the tolerance of the KKE. There is only one way this scenario will never become reality: if New Democracy is too strong in the May 21 elections. Because we will be strong, this scenario will be ruled out in practice.
