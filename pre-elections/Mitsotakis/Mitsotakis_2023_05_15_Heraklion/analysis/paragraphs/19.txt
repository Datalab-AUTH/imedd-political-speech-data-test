When we talk about a just Greece, my mind goes not only to justice and the need for it to be administered more quickly, it goes first and foremost to the weakest.You know, our party is the great popular party of our country, the party that always stands by the weakest. We are the party of the social market economy and the party that knows that in a free economy there will always be fellow citizens who are left behind and need the support of the state.We have introduced the minimum guaranteed income, we are increasing it by 8% and I am very happy because the platform for the Personal Assistant has already been opened throughout the country. 2,000 of our fellow citizens with disabilities will finally have a person by their side who can help them in their work, in their personal life.It is a commitment, you know, that I have undertaken, the strategy for people with disabilities. I feel the need to say it here today: when we came to power there was not really a single strategy for people with disabilities; we have developed it and we have done a lot of things, which the disability movement recognises. And I am not just talking about the increases in disability benefits. It was an obligation that I undertook in memory of my mother, Marika Mitsotakis, who fought so hard to ensure that we finally treat people with disabilities as equal citizens and not as citizens of a lesser god.
