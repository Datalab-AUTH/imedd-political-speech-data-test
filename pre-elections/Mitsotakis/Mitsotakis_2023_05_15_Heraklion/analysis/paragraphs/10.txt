But I want to say a few words about the interconnection with the Peloponnese, with the small and the big interconnection which will relieve us -Linoperamata, Atherinolakko, plants that burn polluting oil will be replaced by new energy production, by the sun and by the wind.I could mention the new wings in Venizelio that were delivered. The renovation of the University Hospital that is underway. The new courthouse in the city.The new student residences for our youth and for those who choose Crete as a study destination. Thousands of new student halls of residence will be built so that you will have access to very cheap accommodation.The GOP was again the big winner of the student elections and we thank our youth, ONNED and the GOP, who always set this nice tone at all our meetings.
