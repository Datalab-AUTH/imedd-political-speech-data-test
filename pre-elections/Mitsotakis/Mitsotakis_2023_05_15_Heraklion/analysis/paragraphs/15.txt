And while we are on the subject of wages, friends, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot refrain from making a comment on the Collective Labour Agreement, which was signed in the tourism sector here in Crete, and which was deemed extendable by decision of the Ministry of Labour. A newly hired receptionist with no particular experience receives EUR 925, 20% above the minimum wage. This is the way, after all, to increase wages in our country, with more growth, with more private investment, with more public investment; what we are saying is already being put into practice. You know that in tourism there is a demand for skilled staff and this is pushing up wages. And my targets for tourism are ambitious. We can reach 30 billion in annual tourism revenues by 2030 and the big winners from this tourism boom will be our Crete.
