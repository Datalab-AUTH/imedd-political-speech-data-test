But the same applies to our other promises. Greece used to be a centre for migrants passing through. It has become a homeland with borders on land, air and sea. We have proved that the sea has borders too, and that we can protect those borders.Flows have been reduced to almost zero. A few days ago I was in Lesvos. Moria no longer exists. It belongs to the past. Our islanders themselves know how much of a relief this is for them. And no matter how much some people object, inside and outside Greece, I insist: the Evros fence will extend across the entire border.
