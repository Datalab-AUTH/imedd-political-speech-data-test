For our education, I am sure that we will have among us some of our 25,000 teachers who have been hired permanently to serve the needs of our education.We will hire 4,000 more this year, we will significantly increase the number of experimental schools, model schools, we will link our universities even more closely to the needs of the labour market.I want these children, especially the children who are studying in the excellent universities of Crete, to know that the next day their degree will have an impact and that their universities will be a place of knowledge, not a place of violence. For we are 'with the libraries, not the sledgehammers'. And why ONNED has always, historically, fought for open and safe universities.
