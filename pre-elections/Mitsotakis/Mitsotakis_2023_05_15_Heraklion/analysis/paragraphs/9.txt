Friends, I have tried in a few words to describe the four-year effort to lay the foundations of the new Greece that you see being built around us. And I have insisted on this very brief account to illustrate the great importance between words and deeds, what it is that ultimately distinguishes one government that is distinguished for its consistency from another government that has done the exact opposite of what it said it would do.We see at this moment the whole country has been transformed into one big construction site. In Athens, the Metro is being expanded. In Thessaloniki - I will be in our capital in two days' time - I am putting my commitment into practice. By the beginning of 2024, Thessaloniki will have the most modern Metro in Europe. We said it and we did it. Major roads are being built all over the country and here, of course, the great project of a lifetime for our Crete. A personal bet of mine, the Northern Road Axis, which is finally starting. The older ones will remember it being claimed decades ago by Constantine Mitsotakis. Well, this dream is now becoming a tangible reality for the whole of Crete. The way has been cleared for the road we have always wanted. And in a few years our whole island will be united, so that everyone can move safely from one end of the island to the other.As I was landing I could see in the background the major works that are being done at the new airport in Kastelli. The largest open construction site in the country today. More than 20% is already completed. It will be delivered on time but the studies for the development of the old airport, the "Nikos Kazantzakis" airport, will also proceed. We will be ready at the time of relocation to return this very important area back to the society of Heraklion. It will not take us 18 years, as it did at Elliniko, to develop the old airport.I cannot fail to mention the upgrading of the port. We still haven't seen what the port of Heraklion can offer.
