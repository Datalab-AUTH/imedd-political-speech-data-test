At the same time we turned our attention to the low paid. The ones who are most challenged by imported precision. The basic wage was increased by 20%. We received it at 650 euros, it is today at 780 euros.And for our pensioner friends who are with us, you know better than I do that for the first time they have seen increases of almost 8% after 12 years. Those who are still wronged by the Katrougal personal differential are already being boosted and will continue to be boosted until the personal differential is finally erased. It is my commitment and I will keep it.We here in Crete and especially in Heraklion know what growth dynamics means for our economy. How we have created almost 300,000 jobs in four years.
