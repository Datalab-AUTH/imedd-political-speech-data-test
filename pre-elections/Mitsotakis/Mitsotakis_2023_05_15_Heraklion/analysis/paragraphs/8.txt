All of Crete is blue and all of Crete must become blue.But be careful, the national shield has a second aspect, not only the armouring of the Armed Forces, but also diplomacy, and it is a shield that starts with strategic defence agreements with America and France, goes on to the definition of Maritime Zones with Italy and Egypt and our relations with Israel and the Arab world, to the extension of our territorial waters in the Ionian Sea and, for the first time in ten years, after much talk but nothing in practice, to the hydrocarbon exploration that we are currently carrying out southwest of Crete.The voice of our country is now being heard loud and clear in Brussels, not only in the geopolitical but also in the economic field. You know, I too went to Brussels and negotiated, not for 17 hours to bring back a 100-billion-euro memorandum, but for five days to bring home 31 billion from the Recovery Fund.Add to this money the resources of the Rural Development Programme and the 26 billion of the new NSRF, and you can see the importance of European support in the effort to revive our Greek economy.
