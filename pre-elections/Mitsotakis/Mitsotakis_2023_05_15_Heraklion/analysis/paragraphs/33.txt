So from this blessed island, from the birthplace of mythical Europe, I call on you to make our motto a reality, a Greece that moves forward, steadily. We want it, we can achieve it, we will achieve it.So let's go to the struggle, my fellow Cretans, Cretans and Cretans, let's go together. On Sunday morning the ballot boxes will be empty, by the evening they will be flooded with New Democracy ballots.Everything is in our hands. Let us go for the great victory. Fly our flags and our hearts high, higher our country, higher our Crete.Be well, thank you. Let's go together for the great victory.
