These five Greeks that I envision, friends, can become reality, just as the ambitious goals we set in 2019 have become reality. I asked you in 2019 to sign a truth agreement. I have kept it on my part, and consistency of words and deeds is the hallmark of this truth contract that we are called upon to renew today.I think that, in the end, this is our biggest difference from our opponents, of whom I speak little as we approach the elections. They seem to be constantly concerned about what I am doing, they only talk about Mitsotakis and I only talk about the future. That is the difference between us.I have said many times that I prefer comparison to conflict with them. To compare their past, the closed banks, the taxes, the pensioners to remember the Katrougalos law and send the bill. Let them send the bill to the one who cut pensions and compare our own reductions, our pay rises, but let us also measure the present, with those who are still making false promises today, with those of us who are presenting costed commitments. 83 billion in benefits, they don't tell us where they will be found, as I said, they refuse to cost their programme, and that is why Mr Tsipras whistles indifferently every time we ask for his programme to be costed by an independent body, because he knows very well that our proposals, look, they are not just our proposals, they have been submitted to Europe, they are part of the medium-term programme, they are evaluated by the European Commission. His own lies have been cut out of the money tree again, they are just words without a single number, "the big words are lies", as the song goes.
