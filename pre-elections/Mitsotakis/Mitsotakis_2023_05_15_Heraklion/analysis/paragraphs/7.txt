And let those who will vote remember that we are not only voting for the economy, for health care. We are also voting to strengthen the country's geopolitical position, to strengthen our defence. We were the ones who in record time added 24 new Rafale fighters to the Air Force arsenal. The upgraded F-16 Vipers are already flying from the 115th Fighter Wing in Chania. Above you they are flying, no matter how often we don't see them.The first Navy frigates Belharra, the most modern, mind you, ship that will exist in the Mediterranean, are already being built in France. We will take delivery of the first one before the end of 2025.All this next to our regenerated shipyards, next to our strengthened defence industry. Because for us, the great patriotic party of the progressive centre-right, national defence is the ultimate end in itself.
