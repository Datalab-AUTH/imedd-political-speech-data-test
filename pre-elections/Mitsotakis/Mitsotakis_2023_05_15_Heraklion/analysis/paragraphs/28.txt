I'm sorry, but I don't believe that joining forces with SYRIZA is the path that the friends of PASOK want. Because they know very well that together - we may have been in different parties - but together we resisted populism. Together we kept the country in Europe, together we fought the populism of "the upper and lower squares", together we denounced the Novartis plot, together we were vindicated, and ordinary PASOK voters, to be honest, know that today we live better than in 2019. Even if we see the glass half full and they see it half empty, they do not see it empty and broken, as SYRIZA tells them.And they refuse to risk what they have conquered and become a follower of the one who until yesterday was their opponent. Just as the friends of PASOK know that together we joined with some of them in the great current that turned the country's page four years ago.They are worried when they see that with their vote it may - it won't happen, but it may, mathematically there is a possibility - that Mr Tsipras and his company will return out of the window. And so they will think twice and thrice. Their position is not with adventurism, but with responsible patriotism and creative modernization. The one expressed by the broad progressive and patriotic bed of New Democracy.
