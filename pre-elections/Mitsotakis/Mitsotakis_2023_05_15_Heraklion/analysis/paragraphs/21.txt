I spoke just now about energy and the need to be able to produce our own energy. Not to be dependent on gas imports. We paid seven billion last year in gas imports alone. Think about how much cheaper and environmentally friendly it is to produce our own energy from the sun and wind.How much more widely accepted are a number of Department of Energy programs that ultimately reduce energy costs for every household. The "Change My Water Heater" program has broken the records. As has 'Save Money'. Why? Because they are programmes that use European resources so that you can reduce your own energy footprint.We will continue with this policy.
