But, today, I am not here to talk in detail about these things, you know, I am here more to talk about the bets of the future, but I am here to talk about our mistakes, about the failures that must become successes, because I will be the first to say that despite the great progress we have made, friends, not everything is as we wanted.The economy, for example, has done very well. Yes, we are one step closer to the investment tier, which is extremely important because it will be able to provide all businesses, all households, with cheaper borrowing costs. But I am well aware, I am constantly told, especially by our young people, that wages remain low and are being nibbled away by the inexactitude.
