There is, however, something else very characteristic. In SYRIZA's programme, which it calls a plan, one word is repeated 36 times. The word "abolition". It is the best proof that he ultimately wants to demolish everything that the Greeks have painstakingly built so that we can return to his ruins. Just like four years ago, the only word we heard from the opposition was 'no'. No to everything, yes to nothing; Greeks, Cretans and Cretans will not do them any favours. Mr Tsipras will be left alone again, sunk in his hypocrisy.Proclaiming everywhere, what? I was looking at the posters again: "Justice everywhere". A justice who underestimates intelligence when he has the 13-0 convict in the Special Court, Mr. Pappas, next to him. Justice only when the judiciary makes good decisions for him, but when the decisions are reversed, then we are talking about political persecution and not justice.
