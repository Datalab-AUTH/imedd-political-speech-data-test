But not only that, because at the same time we have not forgotten our commitments. Do you remember what I promised you, here, from Crete, from Heraklion, before the July 2019 elections? I promised you less taxes and contributions and more jobs. I promised you income support with care for the weakest. I pledged to you a country with secure borders and a voice that would be heard proudly abroad. Have we delivered on all that? Yes, we did. Where are we today? All of you, all of us are paying 50 less in taxes. The shoulders of the Greeks have been permanently relieved of a burden of EUR 7 billion. I told you that I would cut ENVIA by 30% and we reduced it by 35%. And 10% more from now on for insured properties. We increased the tax-free allowance. The first rate dropped from 22% to 9%. Our farmers when they cooperate pay half the tax when they cooperate. The solidarity levy was abolished and, yes, parents now transfer property to their children for free. We have, in effect, abolished the parental benefit tax.
