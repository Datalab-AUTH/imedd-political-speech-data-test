For social Greece I have two priorities. I am glad that today we have with us the leader of the State Electoral Committee, Irini Agapidaki. She has quietly put up a great fight for the National Health System, for public health.We know very well that despite the steps that have been taken in the National Health System, we have to make leaps and bounds in the next four years. We cannot have patients still suffering in corridors, waiting five and six months for an operation. We will rebuild the emergency departments in all major hospitals. We will radically modernise 156 health centres with resources from the Recovery Fund and permanently recruit 10,000 staff to the NHS, primarily nurses but also doctors.We will reduce waiting times by 50%. We will develop telemedicine and primary care and put even more emphasis on preventive examinations. Because what we can prevent we will cure much more effectively if we detect the disease earlier.Unfortunately, here in Crete, although we should be in the heart of the island with the Mediterranean diet, we have gone a little bit off the beaten track in our eating habits, so sometimes it is good to prevent the disease before it knocks on our door.For the women who are with us. 130,000 women have already been screened for breast cancer. 7,000 have been identified with early breast cancer. They will get well, because when breast cancer is detected early, it can be cured. That's prevention in action, that's public health before the hospital.
