And our message in a week's time must also send a message of dynamism and robustness to the other side of the Aegean, but it must also send a message of robustness to Albania, where some people have got their answer with the victory of our expatriate, Freddy Beleri, in the municipal elections in Himara.I went to Himarra - the first Greek Prime Minister - and made a commitment to the Greek ethnic minority that the motherland will always be close to them. And now it remains for Albania to return to the path of the Rule of Law, with its liberation.
