It is divided into five chapters, as its title suggests, for a productive, social, just, digital and green Greece. I say this at every opportunity, green environmentally, because Greece will be blue and Crete will be blue after the elections on 21 May, but above all, a strong Greece. My first goal, especially when I see young people who are struggling for their future, is better wages. Four years ago I looked you in the eye and told you that my first priority is to reduce taxes and contributions. I look you in the eye again and I tell you that the next four years will be the four years of better pay for all and for all. For civil servants, for private employees; with an average salary of 1,500 euros, with a minimum wage of 950 euros. Increased pay scale for the public sector, additional, tax-free 1,000 euros for families with children. Presumption of living - our fellow citizens often tell me this, how unfair the presumptions are - we will reduce them by 30%. We will reduce social security contributions even further and we will gradually abolish the last of the memorandum taxes, which is the business tax.
