Young democrats of Heraklion, fellow countrymen and women, Cretans and Cretans, This must be the biggest political gathering that has taken place in Crete for a long time and my words are too few to describe this impressive reception. It shows that, as it did a few weeks ago in Chania, so today in Heraklion, it sends the message of a great victory.I want to win a bet that we have all made together, that all of Crete will be dressed in blue on 21 May. The whole country should be blue, in the colours of the homeland and of the party for a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy.This election period has gone by quickly, we are about 120 hours away from the polls. But that is why I am here, for the second time in Crete, the only place I have visited twice during this election period, to take strength from our land and additional courage, from your optimism, from your smiles.Because the country requires stability in its conquests, it requires continuity in its progress and it requires consistency in the path it has charted forward. So here in Heraklion, too, it is shouting "no to a second time in disaster" and giving a second strong mandate for progress.We are doing our best, as only we Cretans know how to do, and on the day of Constantine and Helen, when Constantine Mitsotakis would be celebrating with us - and I see many of his old friends with us - on this day, Constantine and Helen, we welcome the great celebration of democracy, we bring the firsts to all our prefectures and we send with the waves of our sea the slogan of unity and new hope throughout the Greek territory.
