I also know that the National Health System withstood the pandemic. We have today, mind you, twice as many intensive care units as we had three years ago. We have recruited 18,000 new doctors and nurses, and overall with the retirements the strength of the NHS has increased by 7,000. But we still have staff shortages, we have cots, we have long delays in operations; the same in the state. The gov.gr has abolished the old queues and it is a great success of our government. The NFKA, at last, is issuing pensions in two months and not in two and three years. But recent tragedies have shown that much still needs to change.But also for our education, for young children, who are now in the public university, they need to know that their degrees have impact and they are being led to a profession that will eventually lead them to better incomes.So these weaknesses of the first four years become priorities for the second, so that all the old experiences are united with new expectations, in this New Democracy's governance programme. We are presenting our programme, and we are not ashamed to talk about its costing. We do not hide it carefully, it is here. And we put it to the judgment of any independent analyst to assess whether it really costs 9 billion as we say it does.
