And this is the right choice for our country, for our Crete, for Greece, for our children, and I ask you to take it everywhere. In the next few days - there are five days left until the elections - you, the traditional fighters of our party, will be the first to take this message to every village, every district, every home. A big thank you to those here, in the difficult elections in Crete - we have been through difficulties here - who kept the party standing and the flags of New Democracy flying high.We have people beside us, but - because, you see, we have become many more - we have people beside us without party blinkers who want a better tomorrow. As I have said, we are a great wave with a party not only of one colour - blue is dominant, but other colours are also coming together in our democratic bed - and this, after all, is what Eleftherios Venizelos taught us: that great liberal breakthroughs are only brought about by great popular rallies.
