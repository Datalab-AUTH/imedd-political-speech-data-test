Finally, for a strong Greece, we have many answers. Not only the fence, but also my unequivocal commitment that the arms programmes that we launched in the last four years will continue and will be completed. And Greece will always have a strong deterrent against anyone who covets its sovereignty and sovereign rights.And a word about the police. Only the digital state and the simplification of procedures will allow us to free almost 5,000 police officers from bureaucratic and office jobs, to return to the neighbourhoods, close to the citizen, and to consolidate the feeling of security everywhere. Across the country.
