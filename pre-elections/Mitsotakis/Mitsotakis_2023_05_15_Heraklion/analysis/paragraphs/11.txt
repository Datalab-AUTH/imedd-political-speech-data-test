Many things are happening in Crete and in the field of culture: the redevelopment of the archaeological site of Phaistos and of course let's not forget that the new regional programme, the new CIP, is increased by 150 million compared to the previous one - 565 million in total from this financial resource alone for the Crete of the future.But we have discussed all this in detail, because as you remember we were here again for the presentation of the development programme of Crete. 480 projects of EUR 7.7 billion. Today, I do not want to talk to you about them; you should know that this is one of the largest development programmes in the whole country, so that we can make Crete a true champion of growth and social cohesion.
