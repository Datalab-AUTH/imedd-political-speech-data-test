For young kids, we have an answer to the question that I am almost always asked by youth everywhere I go, all over the country: "how to own my own home, how to get out of rent, how owning a home is not a pipe dream. "The "My Home" program is already a huge success. 20,000 young, young couples can own their own home by repaying a favourable loan with instalments less than a rent. It is a very important initiative. Social counterpart will follow. Just think how much public land we have that is completely underutilised. We can build apartments, a portion kept by developers, the rest made available to young people. We would give cheap housing to over 100,000 young people and young couples.
