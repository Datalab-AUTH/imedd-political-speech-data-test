So, to put it differently, the vote on 21 May will be a message of certainty at home, but it will also be a message of strength abroad. I say it and I repeat it, the dilemma of the ballot box is clear: do we go forward or do we go back? Do we want results or do we want to lie again? Do we want better wages and salaries or do we want taxes and cuts again? Do we want borders secure or open to every threat? In short, do we want New Democracy and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis or Syriza and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras? We weigh, decide and vote; we have no room for experiments in ungovernability. We have no room for paralysis bargaining. No mistake and no carelessness can be corrected later, which is why I think that the mantra that a friend of mine said to me just before I took the podium is perfectly valid: "from my country I ask the jokes to let go, on the Sunday that comes right to vote".
