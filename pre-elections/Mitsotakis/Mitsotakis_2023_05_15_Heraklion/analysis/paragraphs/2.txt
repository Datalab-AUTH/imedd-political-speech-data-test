That is how we have managed to overcome so many difficulties in such a short time. First the migratory invasions in Evros and the Aegean, then a pandemic that lasted more than two years, then the energy crisis and the global precision of the war in Ukraine. And almost daily, notice, for almost four years, the aggressive actions of neighbouring Turkey.Against all this, we stood up with Greece stronger today than it was four years ago. With society more united. With Greeks, despite the difficulties that we still face, more optimistic.
