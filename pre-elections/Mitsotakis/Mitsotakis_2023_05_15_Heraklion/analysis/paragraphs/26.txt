Just as they underestimate the intelligence of the Greeks, his half-truths about the Evros fence, which he fought so hard for both inside and outside the border.I do not forget, friends, the difficult days we had last August when the media were suddenly flooded with the story of "little Maria". You remember 'little Maria', who supposedly died, bitten, it is said, by a scorpion. And there was the lashing by Mr Tsipras and the various left-wing media: 'you who do not respect the rights of refugees'.And what did it turn out to be? That "little Maria", to borrow an expression of Mr. Koutsoumbas, was a "muff", was a lie and they didn't even dare to apologize for dragging the country abroad.
