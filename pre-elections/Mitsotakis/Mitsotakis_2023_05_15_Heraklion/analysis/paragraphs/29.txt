Frankly, friends, I cannot easily follow this dangerous Babel that exists against the New Democracy. But I do know one thing, one thing I can discern: the precipice to which it could lead us. And I insist on this: we are in an uncertain international environment, facing an unpredictable neighbour. Greece needs a clear horizon on its path and a clear solution in its leadership. Look at the situation in Turkey yesterday. Personally, I know very well, four years I know very well the fluctuations in this relationship. I have handled them in very difficult times. But I have strengthened the armed forces, built alliances, strengthened the economy, and made Greece a pole of geopolitical stability.
