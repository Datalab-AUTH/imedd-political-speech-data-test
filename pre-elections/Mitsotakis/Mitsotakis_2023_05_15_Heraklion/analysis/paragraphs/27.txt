In short, friends, on 21 May, yesterday is attempting to threaten today and tomorrow, armed with a trap that we had warned about from the very first moment: the trap of proportional representation. That is why I make it a priority to cancel this trap that leads to ungovernability. With voices that want to turn your euros into 'Demeter' and your deposits into a paperweight. These are views that hover on the surface of half-hearted partnerships of mismatched partners.At the same time, your fellow Heraklionite, Mr Androulakis, says that he does not want the Prime Minister to be the one the people will vote for, but someone "unknown X". He does not reveal him to us. He knows him, but he does not tell us. I am sorry, but Mr Androulakis is looking to the past and has ended up fighting a one-fronted battle against me. And that is exactly where he meets Mr Tsipras.
