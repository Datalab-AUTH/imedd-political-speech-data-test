Only this will prevent all the scenarios which - be absolutely sure and certain - some people are still running around. Because you see that the protagonists of '15 are still here.I imagine that Mr Varoufakis will come to the debate to explain to us how he will make your euros "Demeter", eh?  But this is no laughing matter, it is very serious. And there in the debate they might explain to us - and everybody - how they understand exactly this progressive governance they are talking about, and we say to them: we are not interested in any such "progressive governance". We want New Democracy to be strong, we have a proposal for governance, we are tried and tested in the difficulties of power. We can take the country even higher and we ask you to give us the strength to do so.
