For a Greece where unemployment will be well below 10%, where wages will be better, where the state of the National Health System - and I insist on this - will have nothing whatsoever to do with the current NHS. That is my big bet for the second four years; if you ask me what I would like to see drastically changed in the country, I would say, we will have an NHS that can serve everyone with social justice. Not having to wait 6 and 12 months to have an operation, having good primary care, good hospitals.You have a good, excellent hospital here in your area, which can be made better. Personal doctor, screening for everyone. Use of technology, another public health picture in the next four years.
