I want to remind you that in 2020, after the pandemic, I went and sat at the European Council table, we negotiated for five days - not just seventeen hours - and we came back with an additional 31 billion euros for our country. And that is money that works for everyone and for everyone. When we modernise the emergency departments at the Triasio - I will give you just one example - this is money from the Recovery Fund. When all the children here, who have their flags up, a year from now will have - look - interactive whiteboards in every classroom from grade five on up, that is Recovery Fund money. When people with disabilities have a "personal assistant" so they can live their lives, work and relieve their families of the burden of care, know that this is Recovery Fund money. This is all money that we brought home.
