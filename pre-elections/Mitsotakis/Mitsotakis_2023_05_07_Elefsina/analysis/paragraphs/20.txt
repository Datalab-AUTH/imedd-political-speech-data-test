But one thing you will know, friends, is that this ballot is extremely critical. I am glad, indeed, of today's gathering, I honestly did not imagine we would have so many people on Sunday night. We are doing very well. We're going to do better; but I don't want between now and the election, I don't want anyone to be complacent. I'm talking to old New Democracy campaigners and new friends of our party.And I know very well that elections are won one vote at a time by you. We are doing our job, but elections are won by all of you. The fighters of the New Democracy.
