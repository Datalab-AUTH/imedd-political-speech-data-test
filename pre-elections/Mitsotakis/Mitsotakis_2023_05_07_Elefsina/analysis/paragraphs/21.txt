So I don't want us to be complacent for a moment. We have 14 days of hard work until the last ballot box is closed. I want from now until the election to talk only positive things. I have no inclination, you saw I didn't say a word, a word, about our political opponent.  Besides, I don't need to say much. I don't need to say much, they say it all themselves.Here they have come, look, here they are, now the lack of arguments, three days now they have been arguing about the legacy of Andreas Papandreou, as if we care about what happened in Greece in '81.
