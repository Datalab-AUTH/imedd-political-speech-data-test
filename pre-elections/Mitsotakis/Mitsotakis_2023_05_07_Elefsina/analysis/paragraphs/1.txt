Thank you for such a warm welcome. I didn't expect this, we have at least three times more people than we had the last time I was in Elefsina. I will be the Prime Minister, with your support and with New Democracy as the protagonist in West Attica, as it deserves. Because in exactly two weeks from now, on the evening of Sunday 21 May, the results will justify our great effort. There will be a big winner. New Democracy strong for a self-reliant government, for a self-reliant Greece. For the flags of New Democracy to be high, the flags of our country to be high. So that we can continue this very important work that we have started.
