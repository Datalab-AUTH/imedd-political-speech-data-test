I want to tell you how pleased I am with the overall progress that has been made in Elefsina over these four years. And the Mayor is right when he says that at our first meeting, which we had in 2019, the situation in terms of the preparation of the cultural capital was bordering on the dramatic.Despite the difficulties of the pandemic, we have succeeded. Elefsina is the cultural capital of Europe and the government stood by Elefsina to enable it to fully fulfil this very important role.
