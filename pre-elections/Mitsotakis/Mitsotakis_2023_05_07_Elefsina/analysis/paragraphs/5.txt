I came a little late to talk to you because I had a very nice meeting in the shipyards of Elefsina, which are again bustling with life. Five ships are tied to the docks and are being repaired. The large tank, which, as you know, has been sunk for many years, has now been raised and is preparing to receive the first ship on 15 June. And the workers are smiling for the first time, because they know they have a steady income to feed their families. I would say that the Elefsina shipyards symbolize the whole policy of our government on how to attract investment, on how to improve incomes, on how to reduce unemployment. How, ultimately, young children in particular will be able to claim a better future for themselves and their families.
