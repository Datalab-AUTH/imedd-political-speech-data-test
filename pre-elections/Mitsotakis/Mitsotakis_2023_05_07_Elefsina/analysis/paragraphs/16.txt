So you can expect much more in this area as well. And of course, to the Greece that I envision, the productive Greece, the social Greece, the just Greece, the green and digital Greece, I want to add the strong Greece. And I will insist on this, because as you know things in the world we live in are extremely complicated. We are facing a neighbour who happens to have an election one week before ours and possibly a second election one week after ours, on 21 May.Today things may look a little better, but I do not forget that I had to manage Turkish aggression for three years and that I kept the country safe by building alliances, investing in the Armed Forces and sending the message that no one can play with Greek national sovereignty and challenge our sovereign rights.
