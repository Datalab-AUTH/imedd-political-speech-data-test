Our young friend hasn't gotten wet yet, but I don't know how he'll go to school tomorrow. Anyway, I thank him for holding up the flag of the New Republic and the flag of Greece. And those flags will fly high on May 21 as well. So let us all go together for a great victory. Let's go and meet again here, in the cultural capital, to celebrate the victory of New Democracy, the victory of Greece. Steadily. Boldly. Forward. Be well. Thank you. Thank you for this impressive welcome.
