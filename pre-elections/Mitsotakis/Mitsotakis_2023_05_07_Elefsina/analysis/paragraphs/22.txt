I don't care what happened in Greece in '81, you don't care what happened in Greece in '81, we know what happened then. You are interested in what happens in Greece in '23 and how we move forward and how we all live in a better country. But, in order to be absolutely sure that this ballot will not lead to political monstrosities and underground alliances that will exploit the simple proportional representation between 'progressive forces', there is only one way: to close the door on them by sending a strong message with New Democracy powerful in the ballot box on 21 May.
