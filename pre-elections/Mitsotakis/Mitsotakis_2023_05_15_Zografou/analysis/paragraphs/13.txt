I know, you'll say, "We have a proportional representation ballot and we don't know how the government will be formed the next day." I will tell you one thing: the stronger New Democracy is on the evening of 21 May, the more confident I will be that the next four years will once again be the four years of New Democracy, of a self-reliant New Democracy, of a self-reliant Greece. That is why, when I talk about the simple dilemma of "forward or backward", that is exactly what I mean.
