Our party will be the one that will make Greece Europe everywhere, in all sectors, in the economy, in health, which I know how much you care about. You should know that the next four years will be the four years of the radical overhaul of the National Health System. It is my personal bet that we will invest in our hospitals, that we will fill the gaps, that we will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors in the next four years.
