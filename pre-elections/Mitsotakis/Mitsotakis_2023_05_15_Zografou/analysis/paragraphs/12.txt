So you see, friends, I am not talking about our opponents at all. I am avoiding any personal characterisation, I am only talking about the future, the future is what I want us all to talk about in these last six days between now and the elections. It is extremely critical, because nothing that we have achieved in this four-year period can be taken for granted.The effort must continue and must be intensified. And it can only continue with a strong New Democracy, the big winner on the evening of 21 May.
