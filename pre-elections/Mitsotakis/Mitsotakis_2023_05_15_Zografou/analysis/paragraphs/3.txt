At the same time, we did not back down from implementing all our central election commitments.I was just rereading the speech I made in Thiseio before the 2019 elections. Remember a little bit back then what I had committed to. I told you that we would reduce taxes and contributions, and we reduced 50 taxes and contributions.I told you that I would make Greece a centre of investment, that we would bring in foreign investors, that we would create many new jobs, and we brought 300,000 new jobs into the Greek economy.I told you then that I would increase the minimum wage. Because all our fellow citizens, especially the low-paid, must have a share in growth. We took the minimum wage from 650 euros and raised it to 780 euros.I told you that we would correct the major weaknesses, the crime committed against pensioners by the Katrougalos law. And for the first time in 12 years, pensioners have seen increases in their pensions.And my commitment to continue to support all pensioners who are victims of the personal differential remains in full force. We will continue to support you until the personal differential is erased.
