But I want to tell you one more thing. Because I am addressing old fighters of New Democracy, first and foremost, a big thank you to all those who kept this party standing in difficult times and never abandoned us, because we also went through great difficulties.But I also want to say a big thank you to them and to those who joined us for the first time in 2019 in a great current of progressive modernisation and responsible patriotism. I also want to say a big thank you to those who will vote for us for the first time in this election. Precisely because they have seen, they have been convinced and they know that we honour our word, we do not fool the citizens.Whenever mistakes are made, we look you in the eye with courage and we acknowledge them, but we also have a plan and the experience now, so that we can change this country and really move it forward.
