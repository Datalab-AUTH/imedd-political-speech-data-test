So, friends, six days left until the elections. And I want us to use these few remaining days to talk about the future, not the past. Not to get caught up - and this is also an encouragement to our deserving cadres, we have an excellent slate here in the South Ward, an excellent slate - the encouragement to our cadres is not to get caught up in unnecessary confrontations with our party opponents; they only talk about the past. They present the image of a black Greece, which quite simply exists only in their own imaginary world. They cannot talk about the future, because they have nothing to tell you about the Greece of the future. And they are ashamed to talk about their own past, because everyone remembers the lies they told in 2015 and how they deceived the Greek people.
