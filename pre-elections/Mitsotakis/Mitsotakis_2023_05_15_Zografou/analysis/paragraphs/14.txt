Will we continue on the path of cutting taxes and raising wages or will we go back to an environment of overtaxing the middle class?Will we continue to support pensioners or will we go back to the Katrougalos law that crushed pensions? Will we continue to guard our borders as we have done for four years or will we go back to the open door, "butte dogs grind" logic?Will we continue to invest in our Armed Forces and honour the alliances we have signed with our strategic partners or will we whistle indifferently in search of third world alliances that have not worked out well for us in the past?All this, then, is now up to you to decide. I have no doubt that we will be the big winners in the elections.
