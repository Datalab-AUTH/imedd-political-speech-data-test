So I want to ask you, in closing, with only six days left, not to allow our enthusiasm, our smiles, our optimism, which I see today, to turn into complacency. Let us make this positive energy even more powerful, so that we can go looking, find every last contestable vote, and convince our thinking fellow citizens that we are really worthy; we deserve to continue this work, to ask them to judge us objectively for what we have done in the four years, to compare us with what we did in the previous four years. Because, let's not kid ourselves, the issue here is very simple: do we want a New Democracy government and Prime Minister Mitsotakis or a Syriza government and Prime Minister Tsipras? There is no third option, that is the dilemma.
