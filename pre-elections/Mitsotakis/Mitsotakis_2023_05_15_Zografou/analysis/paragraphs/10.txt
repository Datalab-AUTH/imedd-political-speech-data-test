And when this square comes back, think that this is European money that someone brought back to the country. And when we rebuild the emergency departments in our hospitals again you will know that this is European money.When our schools within a year, all our schools, all the schools, all the grades from grade 5 on up, will have interactive whiteboards, remember that these are Recovery Fund resources.When our disabled fellow citizens will have a Personal Assistant for the first time, 2,000 disabled fellow citizens, remember these are also European resources that our own government was able to claim, to finally put them to work for the benefit of all.
