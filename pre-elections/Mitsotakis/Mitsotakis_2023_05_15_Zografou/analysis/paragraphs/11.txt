And of course, lest we forget, this is the government that was able to finally take the sledgehammers out of the universities. Because we are with the libraries, not the sledgehammers. And whenever the police had to intervene here at Zographou's in order to take out evidence that had nothing to do with the universities, we did not hesitate to do so.We will be the ones who will ensure the next day that our universities will be real centres of knowledge, that the children who are working hard today to pass their national exams will not be deceived by those who today say to them "come on, get into universities without even having to take exams". This approach does not honour all the young people who are working hard today to get into the school they want.Our universities, our public universities, will get the infrastructure they need, will open their wings to the world, will finally connect with the world of production, will offer degrees with impact. That is what young children want, and that is what you families want, who have invested in free public education, which our own government has shown that it can support.
