Don't forget, friends - I keep saying this, but it's true - on election day, when the polling stations open, all the polling stations are empty. They are all empty. At the end of the day, especially here in the South Sector, they must be filled with too many New Democracy ballots and that is your job.I am sure, Mayor and Mr. President here of our Prefecture, that when we meet again here in Zografou - after all, I never forget that I started my political journey 20 years ago from the then united North Athens.If you, gentlemen candidates in the South Sector, think that what you are going through is difficult, let me tell you that I had to run all over the North Athens. But I know I have many old friends here who have supported me personally.A big thank you and let's go together for the big win. Let us celebrate together the victory of New Democracy, the victory of Greece. Be well, thank you very much, good strength, good fight and with victory. Thank you very much.
