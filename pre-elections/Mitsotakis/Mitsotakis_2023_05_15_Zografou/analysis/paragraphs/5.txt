Since I am talking about geopolitical developments, I cannot fail to mention the fact that the next elections will not only concern the economy, wages, incomes, health care. I don't want to make any comment on the Turkish elections, because we will wait for the results in the second round. But you should know that we were the ones who managed an aggressive Turkey, we invested in our armed forces, we built alliances, we were able to make the Greece-Turkey issues European issues. And this policy must continue in the coming day. I hope things with Turkey will get better, I am the first to want that. But in any case the country must be ready for any eventuality. And know one thing: backtracking on issues concerning our national sovereignty and sovereign rights is not going to be done by this government. Not from New Democracy.I was particularly pleased to learn that in Himarra, Freddy Beleris managed to be elected Mayor by a narrow margin. And I hope and hope that this adventure will end quickly, because I want to repeat from here: Albania's road to Europe passes through respect for the rights of the Greek National Minority.
