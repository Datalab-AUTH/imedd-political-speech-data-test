Thank you for this impressive welcome. We have filled Zografou Square, we are sending the message here of a great victory. Next Sunday we will be the winners, friends, for a strong, self-reliant Greece.I am happy, friends, because my last presence in the basin before our big final rally in Thiseio on Friday evening is here in Zografou, in the largest constituency in the country, which will be painted blue on election night. Just as the whole of our country will be blue, friends, next Sunday, so that together we can send the message that this effort that we started four years ago must continue. That this truth agreement that we signed together four years ago must be renewed. And that the road we have set out on for our country is a road that must be a road of no return.
