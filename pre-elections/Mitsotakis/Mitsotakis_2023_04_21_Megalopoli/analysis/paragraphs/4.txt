I want you to recall the crises we have had to manage over these four years, starting with the migrant invasion of Evros in March 2020. Immediately afterwards, a pandemic, an unprecedented health crisis, which basically forced us to shut down the entire economy. But I do not believe that there is a single Greek among us who does not recognise that in this unprecedented health crisis the state stood by, supported businesses, supported workers, took over the payroll, gave a refundable advance and kept the productive fabric of the country standing. We have had to deal at the same time with a provocative neighbour and recently, of course, the great crisis of precision, imported precision. An inflationary crisis the likes of which we have never dealt with in the last 40 years. But there, too, we have been close to the citizens. You will have seen today that the electricity prices for next month have been announced and they are relatively lower than the previous prices.
