Consistent with this commitment, we are exhausting our term in government and we enter this election period with the confidence of a party that has honoured the truth agreement we signed with the Greeks in July 2019. When I was in Arcadia before and I spoke to you during the election campaign, I told you that my first concern would be to revive the Greek economy and get us out of the path that the previous ones had set, a path of disrepute, a path of limited growth, a path of taxes that crushed the middle class, of pension cuts. The growth of the economy was the first objective of this government and at the same time it is this growth that allowed us to be able to implement our election commitments, to reduce taxes for every Greek, to reduce contributions, to attract investment, to claim more European resources, to boost the economy as a whole.
