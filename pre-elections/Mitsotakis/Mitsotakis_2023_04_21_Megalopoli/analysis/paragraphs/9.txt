I will tell you only one thing: trust me. What I say, I put into practice, and my credentials are the credibility of the works and words that have distinguished the whole of our four years of government. Because what we said to you during the election, we have to a very large extent put into practice. I didn't promise you miracles. I promised you hard work, concrete goals, measurable results.
