And today, as we take stock, I think all our fellow citizens in good faith recognize that Greece is in a much better position than where it was in 2019. We are stronger, with a stronger economy. We are recognised in Europe as the pleasant surprise. Nobody talks about Greece as the "black sheep" of Europe anymore. And the big question, then, and that's why this election is so critical, is whether we're going to continue on this course or are we going to risk it all and kick the bucket of milk to get back, I wonder, to where?
