Fourth priority, because I also see a lot of young people, a lot of young kids here. Thank you. Thank you to our youth, the UNNED, the students of our Polytechnic. A better home for the youth. A big challenge for me, in addition to the projects we are doing to get student housing for the Polytechnic, with public and private sector partnership, hold back the great importance I attach to the "My Home" programme. Do you know what it is for a young person to know now that they can own their own home and take out a loan and pay a lower payment than they would pay if they were renting a house, but in the end they will still have the house? 10,000 young people will benefit from this programme. I have pledged that once it is exhausted, I will double the funds. Because our young people need to know that they can have a home of their own.
