And it is true, friends, that for four years together we have been through and overcome a lot. From the hybrid attack in Evros and the migrant incursions to the constant threats. And from the pandemic waves to the war in Ukraine, its chain effects, the international energy crisis, the imported revaluations. Friends, no government since the post-war period has faced so many obstacles and so many adverse conditions in such a short period of time. And yet, we overcame them all. And we have turned these difficulties, citizens and state, into successes. Our borders remained impregnable.
