Neighbouring Bulgaria is heading for a sixth election. Be careful, sixth election in two years. We must prevent these developments. And that is why the ballot box on 21 May is so decisive. There can be no frivolity, no 'no-brainer' votes. It will ultimately determine who will govern. And the more thunderous its message, the more easily the second election will empower the winner to govern the country properly.
