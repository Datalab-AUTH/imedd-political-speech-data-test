By listening to the voice of society, by recognising our weaknesses, but also by changing the country, we change with the country. That is how we become better, that is how we become more experienced. By having next to us - and this message is of great value in Crete - every citizen who has no party blinkers. Every citizen who believes in responsible patriotism and creative modernisation. In a great current of progress that calls for stability, continuity and consistency in our country's development trajectory.
