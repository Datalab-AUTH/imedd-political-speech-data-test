Friends, four years ago some people told us that "the sea has no borders". And so, more than a million migrants were ploughing the land. However, that land of the "open vineyard" no longer exists. Illegal flows are being prevented, and in spite of those voices - I will say it again here, from the other side of Greece - the fence on Evros is being extended. And, indeed, under the seal of Europe, which rejected the wretched Papadimoulis amendment, which called for the defence of the external borders to be - look out - not financed by Community funds. It should be funded by all of us, all of you Greek taxpayers.
