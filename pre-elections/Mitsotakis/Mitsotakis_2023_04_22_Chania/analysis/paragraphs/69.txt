Do we want a government that will win in the rough and tumble or one that will shipwreck in the rough and tumble? Do we want a desperate homeland or an armored homeland? Do we ultimately want a leader with a voice abroad or a voiceless guest with a mind at home? In other words and very simply: Do we want New Democracy with Prime Minister Mitsotakis or do we want Syriza with Prime Minister Tsipras? This is the central question to which citizens will answer on May 21.
