At the ports now. We have construction sites everywhere, from Sfakia and Paleochora, to Agios Nikolaos, Sitia, Gavdos. The new pier at the Souda Naval Station is also entering the final stretch. And, of course, perhaps the biggest development project of Crete, by 2027 - with your help I will be the Prime Minister who will inaugurate it - we will have a new international airport in Kastelli, to increase arrivals on the island even more.
