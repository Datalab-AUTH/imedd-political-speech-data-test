Because despite the successive storms we have faced, look at the progress we have made here on our island. Maybe in our country nothing pleases us but the top, but no one doubts how much Crete's GDP has increased, how many investment projects have been approved, more than 1 billion, many of them in Chania. For every business that closes, here in Crete, three are opened. Here in Chania alone we have created 4 000 new jobs.
