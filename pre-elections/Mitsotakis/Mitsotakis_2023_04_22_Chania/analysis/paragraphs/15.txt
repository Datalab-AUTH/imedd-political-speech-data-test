We have lightened the shoulders of citizens and the backs of businesses with a burden of 7 billion. This year, some 1.6 million pensioners saw increases of close to 8% for the first time in 12 years. And those who were wronged, since you mentioned Mr Katrougalos, those who are still wronged by the Katrougalos personal difference were boosted by EUR 200-300. I pledge that we will continue to support these pensioners until the Katrougalos personal differential is finally erased.
