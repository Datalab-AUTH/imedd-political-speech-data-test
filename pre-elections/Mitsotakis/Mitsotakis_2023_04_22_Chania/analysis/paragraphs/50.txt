Tsipras for two of his choices, made at a different time but, mind you, linked to today. First, for his unthinkable recent decision to become an exception to the democratic arc by refusing the regulation that protects the Parliament from the disguised criminals of Golden Dawn. And secondly, for his insidious method of leaving, after having been elected twice, carefully, with enhanced proportional representation, to leave behind the "trap" of simple proportional representation. These are two moves that were made with the aim of damaging New Democracy. But both ultimately damage democracy itself. The one winking at fascism and the other bringing the danger of ungovernability closer. Threats that we, the liberal democrats of Crete, are the first to understand.
