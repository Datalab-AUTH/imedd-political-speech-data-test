It is the same voices that later told us that defence, supposedly, is not an end in itself, to get their answer. With what? 24 new Rafale fighters, 86 modernised F-16 Viper fighters. The first ones are already stationed here at the 115 Battle Wing in Souda. New helicopters, armor, ammunition. But also raises for the uniformed services. Something else very important: the regeneration of our shipyards and the Greek Defence Industry. Because for us, the non-negotiable condition of economic prosperity is the defence of national sovereignty. We are not taking a single step back from our national rights. There is, however, another side to the defence.
