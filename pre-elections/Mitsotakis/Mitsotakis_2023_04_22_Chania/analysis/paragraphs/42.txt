See what happened to the National Health System. Yes, it held up during the pandemic. Yes, it has more than double the number of ICUs, it has more than 15,000 health workers, more than 1,000 of them in total in Crete. It has salaries increased by 10%. But our health remains the big patient. That is why we will allocate 150 million euros just for the modernisation of health structures on our island.
