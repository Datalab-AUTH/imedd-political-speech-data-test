On May 21, all of Crete will be blue, like the sea and the sky. Just as Greece will be blue. A Greece that does not turn back, but moves steadily, boldly and only forward. Thank you for this overwhelming presence. Hearts and flags up, victory is feminine like Greece, Crete and Democracy. That is why it will be ours, a victory for all Greek women and all Greeks. Be well, thank you. Good race, good strength.  .
