Let's see what this opposition is. Four years of opposition to Syriza, four years now, no to everything and yes to nothing. Look, no to defence agreements, no to national armaments, no to the Evros fence, no to investment, no to tax cuts. No, also beware - and I have a particular sensitivity about this - no to the rights of disabled citizens.
