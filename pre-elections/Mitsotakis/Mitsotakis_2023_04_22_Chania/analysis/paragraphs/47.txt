We say too often, the "bad state" and we criticise it and rightly so. But I would like to remind you that "112" is a state, and so is the EMAK, which was the first to rush to Turkey to help its friend country after the devastating earthquakes. The border guards in Evros, who are standing vigil, the police, the ambulance service, are also a state. The state is also the one that organised an impeccable vaccination campaign throughout the country.  It is also the new EFKA, which is now paying out pensions on time. It is also the state that invited more than 120,000 Greek women to have free mammograms. That is the state we want and that is the state we will have if the citizens trust us.
