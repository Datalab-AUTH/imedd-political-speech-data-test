We say too often, the "bad state" and we criticise it and rightly so. But I want to remind you that "112" is a state, and so is the EMAK, which was the first to rush to Turkey to help its friend country after the devastating earthquakes. The state is also the border guards in Evros who are keeping vigil, the police, the ambulance service. It is also a state that has organised an impeccable vaccination campaign throughout the country.  The state is also the new EFKA, which now pays out pensions on time.
