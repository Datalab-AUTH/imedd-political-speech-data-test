Immediately afterwards we will have the final offers for the big part, the concession contract from Heraklion to Chania and up to Kissamos. I will repeat what I have told you: I will deliver to Crete a state-of-the-art motorway from Kissamos to Sitia. We designed the BOAK, we financed it, we started it and we will finish it.
