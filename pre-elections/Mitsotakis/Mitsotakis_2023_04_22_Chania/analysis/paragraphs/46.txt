gov.gr has more than 1,500 services. Do you remember your life before? The queues, the hassles, the time wasted for the simplest transaction with the government.  It's all over now. But we know that the administration still has pockets of anachronism. It showed, unfortunately, in the tragedy in Tempe. Traps that we can overcome, because there is a "good self" in the public sector.
