But on the other hand, I remember, when I was speaking here a little further on, on the other side of the harbour, in 2019, I didn't promise you miracles, I'm not a miracle worker, I'm not a magician. I promised you methodical work and great effort. Effort that lasts as the Greece we are building, this Greece we envision, has now acquired solid foundations. The first floors are ready. We must now complete the building. But in order to complete the building of the Greece we all envision, we need the same commitment to the original plan and the same care to avoid mistakes. Eleftherios Venizelos used to say that 'it is the great masters who make the great mistakes'. And do not forget that the country we want began to be built on a deserted plot of land full of mines.
