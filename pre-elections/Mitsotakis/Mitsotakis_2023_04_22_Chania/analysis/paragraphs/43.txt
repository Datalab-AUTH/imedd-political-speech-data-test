And the same thing happened in education. I am sure that among us we will have some of the 25,000 appointed teachers in our education system. The first appointments made, again, in 12 years. 2,500 in Crete alone. From 62 Standard and Experimental Schools, we have reached 138. Our young children are taught a foreign language in kindergarten and soon every Greek class, from the 5th grade onwards, will have interactive whiteboards. 36,000 new interactive whiteboards for all our schools.
