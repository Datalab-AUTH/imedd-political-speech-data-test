Friends, no government since the post-war period has faced so many obstacles and so many adverse conditions in such a short period of time. Yet we have overcome them all. And we have turned these difficulties, citizens and state, into successes. Our borders remained impregnable. And with a gigantic programme of more than 50 billion, households, businesses and jobs were supported. I am sure that all businesses in Chania are well aware of the support we have given them in these difficult years.
