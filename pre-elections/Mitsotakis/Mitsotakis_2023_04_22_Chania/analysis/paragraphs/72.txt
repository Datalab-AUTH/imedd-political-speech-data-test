Who is she? I want you to imagine, a government of SYRIZA - PASOK - Varoufakis, the same Varoufakis who now says again that he will close the banks again, with Tsipras as Prime Minister and in exchange for the permanent use of proportional representation. A double objective of their own, but one that constitutes a double disaster for Greece. An eventuality, not very likely, but under certain conditions real. There is only one way to prevent it: A strong New Democracy, a clear victory in the May 21 elections.
