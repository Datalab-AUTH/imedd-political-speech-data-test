Has everything therefore been perfect in these four years? No, I will be the first to answer. But I will add, in all honesty, that this government has never invoked the many storms it has managed to give up its objectives. It would be too easy for me to come here today and say: we have had so much, one crisis after another, I have not had time to implement our electoral programme. It did not happen. We served our objectives, we achieved them.
