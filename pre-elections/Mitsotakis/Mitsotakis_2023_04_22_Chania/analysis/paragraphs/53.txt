Keep five big priorities. In 2019 I looked you in the eye and said: I pledge to cut taxes for all and for all. Today I look you in the eye and I say: the next four years will be the four years of better wages for every Greek. We can increase our salaries by 25% in four years and in 2024 it will finally apply to the public sector, because the salaries of public servants have been frozen for many years, the new single pay scale. My purpose is simple. All workers in Greece must finally and quickly approach the European average. And in the same way, the business tax must and will be abolished as tax compliance improves.
