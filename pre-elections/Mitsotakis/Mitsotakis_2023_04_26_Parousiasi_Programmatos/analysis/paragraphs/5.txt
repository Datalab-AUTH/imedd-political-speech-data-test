I told you that we would reduce taxes and contributions, we have reduced taxes and contributions. Everything mentioned here, at least the first five points, were explicit commitments in our election programme. In fact, on the ENVIA, we even went beyond what we told you and reduced the ENVIA by 35%, not 30% as we had committed to. And of course, the last point, point 6, the effective abolition of parental donations for first-degree relatives, was an additional political intervention that we had not mentioned during the election campaign. I stress again that we reduced all these taxes without compromising fiscal stability and contradicting those "Cassandras" who claimed that during Covid and during the energy crisis we were spending beyond our means. The official Eurostat figures came in, they were solemnly refuted. The country managed in 2022, for the first time, to produce a primary surplus despite tax cuts.
