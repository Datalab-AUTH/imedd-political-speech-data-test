Let's now go to our last chapter, which is about a strong Greece, about the policies of defence, immigration, national security.I will start with a picture of today's Civil Protection. I don't want to show you a picture of the situation we found in Civil Protection in 2019. Suffice it to say that it was housed as a secretariat in a building that was roughly dilapidated. If there was an earthquake, it would have been the first building to fall.We now have a new Ministry for Civil Protection and the response to the climate crisis, with significant infrastructure, with a European programme funded by the NSRF, specifically for Civil Protection, which is worth EUR 2 billion, and which we are called upon to implement over the next four years.But we have already put in place the structures for the Civil Protection of the future. We have shown the first results in fire management over the past year. We have learnt our lessons from what we did wrong in the fires of 2021. We have, of course, a natural disaster recovery mechanism and a state relief mechanism, which stands by our fellow citizens who have been tested and who have seen losses to their property; and of course, a great achievement, "112". I thought for a moment about putting it on for a while, but then I thought it would shake you up a bit, so I thought I wouldn't do it.But watch out, "112" has been operating in our country for almost three years now. We now have a culture when the mobile phone rings with that tone to see what the state is telling us and listen to its instructions.We also have a culture of evacuation, which we didn't have. I wish we had it in other natural disasters. It was not self-evident. Britain is now experimenting with '112' and hopes to have it within the next two years. It is a major achievement of which we have every reason to be proud. And we want to be at the forefront of civil protection issues.
