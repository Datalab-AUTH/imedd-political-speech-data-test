In conclusion, friends, I have described to you in broad terms because - as Akis said, whom I want to thank, along with his staff - there has been a lot more work behind the programme that you see. I have just given you an indication of some of the most important initiatives on how we see Greece over the next four years.I often use the metaphor, which I think is apt, of home, our common home, which is none other than our homeland, Greece. We have laid the foundations, the foundations are fiscal stability and a strong economy. Without it, none of what I have described to you can be put into practice. And on these foundations we are building a productive, social, green and digital, just and strong Greece.But this house is not yet complete. The foundations have been laid and we are slowly starting to build. We have already built several floors of the Greece we envision, but the work is not yet complete.
