In the social sector, we are increasing the maternity allowance for self-employed workers and farmers from four to nine months. We are correcting an injustice in the level of the minimum wage and we will also significantly increase the number of places for infants and toddlers in nurseries, in conjunction with the full launch of the "Neighbourhood Nannies" programme. Enabling families and especially working families, working mothers, to feel that they can leave their children in a safe and creative space and work. Because one of the great economic challenges that we have is to increase the participation of women in the labour market, and this cannot happen if we do not have serious social structures that support the family as a whole.
