I would like to say a big thank you to the women and men of the Coast Guard. In 2015, 75% of illegal arrivals in the European Union passed through Greece. Today we are at 5%. We have achieved this because we have shown in practice that we can guard and protect our borders, whether they are land or sea.And we will implement, within the next four years, a very important programme to further modernise the Coast Guard and we will finally complete the digital system for the protection of maritime borders, which will give us a real-time picture - sound from all maritime borders in a single coordination centre.Again, a picture from yesterday and a picture from today. The picture on the left is Samos, this is the situation we received in 2019, just above Vathi, 7,000 people in desperate conditions.The picture on the right is the new reception centre we created with European funding - the one on the left is past. The reception centre exists today in Samos, it is not very crowded because we have managed to limit the migratory flows, but there is a modern and humane infrastructure, which is first and foremost safe.We have reduced the number of reception centres for migrants across the country from 122 in 2019 to 31 today, and we have recruited 2,000 border guards.This photo was taken in early March 2020, together with the leadership of the European Union - Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament, who is no longer with us - flying to Evros, when we protected our country's borders and prevented the migrant invasion organised by the neighbouring country.It was our response to the hybrid threat that we received and the first legacy of a new immigration policy, which now recognises, after a lot of work over three years, that there is no single immigration and asylum policy at European level without being able to protect our external borders.The fence is non-negotiable for the New Democracy government. What you see is the part that has already been completed. Within the next four years the whole of Evros will be shielded, 140 kilometres.
