Justice itself is one of the biggest problems we face. You know very well that justice is delayed, excessively delayed. Here we have a measurable objective: we must reach the European average within four years. What does this mean? Less than 500 days to clear pending cases in the judiciary; this will obviously not happen overnight. We have a very detailed programme for the judiciary which I do not have time to present to you today. Just keep our digital strategy for Justice. How we will use court case management projects to enable us to simplify the way the courts operate; and of course, the new judicial charter for administrative, civil and criminal justice, together with major investments that will be made in court buildings.
