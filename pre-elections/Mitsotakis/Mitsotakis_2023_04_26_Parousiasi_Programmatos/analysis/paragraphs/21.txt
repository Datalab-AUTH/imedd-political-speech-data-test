I want to move on to transport. And the reason why we have this section, in Social Greece, is precisely to demonstrate that Public Transport is not just a development project, but is essentially a policy of social cohesion.Our emphasis on strengthening Public Transport in the next four years will be reflected in a very specific plan for quality public transport, in addition to the new Metro lines that we will be adding, but mainly in reducing the time between train arrivals and environmentally friendly transport. We will have 2,000 new buses in Athens and Thessaloniki, many of which will be electric. We have already secured financial resources and these procurements will be completed very quickly.
