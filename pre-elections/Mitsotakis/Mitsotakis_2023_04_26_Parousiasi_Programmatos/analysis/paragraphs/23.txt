There is no social Greece without accessibility policies. I will then come back to our horizontal policies for people with disabilities, and here I would like to focus specifically on accessibility policies in archaeological sites.For the first time, people with disabilities have gained access to the Acropolis, thanks to the lift and thanks to the corridors that we built, which were so maligned by the opposition. This was the 'cementing' of the Acropolis that Mr Tsipras accused us of, who went up - for the first time, I think - to the Holy Rock to denounce us. Why did we do it? We did it for these people. And UNESCO came to tell us: "You did everything fine and you totally respected the monument".By 2025, disability access projects will have been completed in 21 important archaeological sites. No one should be excluded from being able to visit the country's unique cultural heritage.
