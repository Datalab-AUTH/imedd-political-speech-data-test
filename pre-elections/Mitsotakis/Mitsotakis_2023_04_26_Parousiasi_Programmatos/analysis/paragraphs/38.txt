National LGBTI strategy. Right to blood donation for homosexuals. We did it, not the previous "progressive" government. Progressive in word, but in practice we have devised a strategy for our LGBTI fellow citizens; a ban - we are implementing it now - on conversion therapies for minors. Very bad situations, especially in teenagers, with 'treatments' - God make them treatments - where people were trying to forcefully change their sexual orientation. They were banned now; special employment programs for trans people. A comprehensive policy.  Special actions to protect HIV carriers. And the country is making the most progress in expanding LGBTQ rights in Europe, along with countries like France, Denmark and Ireland. We still have a lot of work to do and to implement the strategy we have developed.
