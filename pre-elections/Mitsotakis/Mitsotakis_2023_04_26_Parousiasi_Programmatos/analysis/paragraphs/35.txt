On the issues of green Greece, I talked to you about 80% of the electricity generation coming from Renewable Energy Sources, about the big reforestation programme. Let me say a little bit more about the energy upgrade of 600,000 homes.You know that we have already launched a number of programmes on energy saving. These are programmes that have been very well received, and we will continue to run them with increased resources. They are tried and tested programmes, they absorb very quickly European resources that we have available to us, they support the domestic industry as a whole because many of the materials used to make our homes more energy efficient are Greek materials. These programmes will continue and will be expanded; we must finally complete a programme that comes from the past, the 45 waste management plants across the country. Because we must now comply fully with the new very strict directives of the European Union and this tragic situation that we have received must be corrected as soon as possible.
