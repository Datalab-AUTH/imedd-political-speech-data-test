"My House." We have said many things about the importance of this programme, which began as a government response to a request that was constantly being made to us by young people who told us: "I can't possibly still live with my parents, I can't have a home, I can't start a family. The possibility of acquiring a home is for me an unattainable dream".In other words, if I do not have a house from my parents - which they can now of course transfer without additional taxation - I am basically condemned either to live on rent, with a very high rent, or to be forced to live with my parents until I am 30 or 35 years old.The 'My House' programme is the response to this demand of the younger generation to acquire a home on reasonable terms. You already know the details of the programme: the possibility of acquiring a house worth up to 150,000 euros on extremely favourable terms, with a loan that is essentially subsidised, with a loan instalment that is 3/4 subsidised by the Greek state, so that the loan instalment that you will pay is substantially lower than the rent that you would pay for a similar house. Only now the house will finally be yours.We have already taken the decision to double the resources available for the "My House" programme in the first phase, as the speed with which applications are being made has also pleasantly surprised us.
