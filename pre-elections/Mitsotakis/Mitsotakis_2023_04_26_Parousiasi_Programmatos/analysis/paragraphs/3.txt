Growth is the foundation on which our economic policy is built. If we do not have growth, we cannot finance the welfare state, we will not have resources for defence, we will not be able to spend more resources on education, on health. So the growth in the four years 2019-2022 was actually almost twice the average growth of the euro area. Make the comparison, where we were from 2015 to 2019. We had essentially under four times the growth rate of the European Union countries. And it's precisely this growth leap that we were able to achieve and that we achieved is what allowed us to support society during the coronoid, to be able to simultaneously reduce public debt by 40 percentage points. To have laid the foundations for a growth policy that will not jeopardise fiscal stability. For me, safeguarding fiscal stability is an inviolable condition and a contract of trust with the new generation. So that we never again reach the point where the country faces the spectre of bankruptcy.
