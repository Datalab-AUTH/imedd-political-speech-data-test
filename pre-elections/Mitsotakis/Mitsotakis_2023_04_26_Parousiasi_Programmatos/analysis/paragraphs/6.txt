So how did we achieve this financial performance? I spoke to you before about investments. In January 2020, just before the pandemic broke out, I was in Davos and I had, at that time, my first meeting with the President of Microsoft, that's the gentleman you see in the background of the picture, Mr. Brad Smith. At that time I spoke to him for the first time about a country that can attract high value-added investment, data centres, that can become a focus for technology investment by big business technology giants. He listened to me with some reservation. But nine months later - in the midst of the pandemic - Microsoft was the first to believe in our story and took the decision to invest hundreds of millions of euros in the creation of three data centres in our country, paving the way for a number of business giants to follow. But it wasn't just Microsoft. Pfizer has, as you may know, set up a truly impressive global innovation centre in Thessaloniki. A truly impressive workplace that encourages innovation, ingenuity. When Pfizer's CEO started this effort he thought he would barely have 200-300 employees in this innovation center. I believe that very soon it will be able to exceed 1,000, for the simple reason that it is now able to attract excellent young scientists, many of whom are returning from abroad to come and work in Thessaloniki.These are the first steps towards reversing the brain drain that our friend spoke to us about a moment ago, which has hurt Greek society so much. It is an example of how foreign investment is creating high value-added jobs in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and big data management, one of the many investments that have been made in our country by foreign companies.
