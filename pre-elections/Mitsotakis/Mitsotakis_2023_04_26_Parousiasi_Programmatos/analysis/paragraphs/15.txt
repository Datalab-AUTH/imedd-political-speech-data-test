And to 950 euros, at least, the minimum wage.We will have new pension increases of 3% to 4% on 1/1/24.  We will have an increase, after many years, in the salaries of civil servants through a new single payroll on 1/1/24, with a total burden of 500 million euros, which we will spend additionally only on the salaries of civil servants.
