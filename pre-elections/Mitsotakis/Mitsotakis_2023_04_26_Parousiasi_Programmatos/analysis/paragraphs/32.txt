This is the research vessel that carried out the seismic surveys southwest of Crete, which have been completed. We are awaiting the data and for the first time a serious job has been done to be able to explore whether there is hydrocarbon wealth within the Greek zone of sovereignty and exercise of sovereign rights.We have covered ten times the area that was covered in the past. And combined with the other investments that are being made in the energy sector, Greece is now becoming an international energy hub. Not only for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, but also as a gateway for natural gas from the wider Mediterranean region.We are now a country that plays a crucial role in the energy stability of the entire Balkans. If it were not for the gas that entered the European system from Greece, our friend Bulgaria would have run out of gas last year. You can understand how important these investments are to upgrade our overall geopolitical role.
