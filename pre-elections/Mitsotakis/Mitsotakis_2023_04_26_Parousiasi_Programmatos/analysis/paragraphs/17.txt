Let us now turn to our tax interventions. You remember that in 2019 - I presented them to you before - we talked very specifically about the need to reduce the tax burden that Mr Tsipras unjustly imposed on the whole of Greek society and especially on the middle class, and we achieved that goal. But that does not mean that there is no room for further reductions in tax rates. And if, I stress, the performance of the budget surprises us pleasantly, we can go beyond these commitments I am presenting to you today. Within four years it will be completely abolished, as tax compliance of self-employed persons will also improve.We increase the tax-free allowance by 1,000 euros for all families with children.We reduce in the first phase by one additional unit the social security contributions in order to reduce taxation on labour.And from 1/1/25 we reduce the presumption of living expenses by 30% on average.
