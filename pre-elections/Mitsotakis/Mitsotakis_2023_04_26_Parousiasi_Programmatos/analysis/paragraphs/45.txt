And of course we cannot talk about security and about a strong Greece, without emphasis on the Police, its continuous strengthening, its reorganization.You see our border guards on the left. It is very moving, you know, the stories I heard on Evros, because we are talking about the fence, but Evros in 2020 was protected by the men and women of the Greek Police and the Armed Forces. They stayed awake for days on end.We have recruited, as I said, 2,000 new border guards. But we are also focusing on new forms of soft policing in the police centres, so that in combination with the work of the police and the presence that will be more intense in all neighbourhoods, we can ensure that all Greek women and men feel safe.The digital revolution is also helping us in this area. Because we estimate that we can release about 5,000 police officers who are currently serving in office positions and get them out on the streets, in the neighbourhoods, where they need to be, by simplifying and digitising procedures.And of course, our commitment remains firm: an end to all lawlessness, wherever it may be.
