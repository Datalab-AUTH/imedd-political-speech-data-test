The fifth point also has its own special value. Yes, we are now approaching the goal of Greece becoming a destination 12 months a year. Athens, Thessaloniki and our major cities have at least already achieved this. In this way we can substantially extend the tourist season, give more work for more months to tourism workers and bring tourism revenues to EUR 30 billion a year. The target is achievable and we can achieve it.
