The next four years will be the four years in which the Greece that we envision will be firmly on its feet, will have become a truly European country, a country with sustainable growth that exceeds the European averages, a Greece with social prosperity, with justice, but justice in practice, not justice in words. Because for me the greatest proof of social justice for a popular party like New Democracy is none other than the possibility for every young person, regardless of where they come from or where they were born, to have the same opportunities to excel and advance in life; a green and digital Greece that will use the resources of the Recovery Fund to meet the two great challenges of a future that is coming at breakneck speed. Either we are talking about climate change and the great challenges we face, or we are talking about a digital world that is changing so fast that you young people can already go into an app, a new tool, ChatGPT and write your assignments. I don't recommend that you do that, but it shows us how much we are obliged to think about how to stand in this world that is changing so quickly. What artificial intelligence means. What are the challenges. What are the opportunities.
