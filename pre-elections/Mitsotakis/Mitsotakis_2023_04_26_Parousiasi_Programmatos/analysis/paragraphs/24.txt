Finally, you've seen this photo, probably, it's the plan of the new Archaeological Museum. The architect who won the international competition was awarded, two weeks later, what is equivalent to the "Nobel Prize for Architecture". The "Pritzker Prize"; it is a visionary plan for the new National Archaeological Museum. We estimate that it will take about two years to complete all the relevant studies, which will be privately funded, and four years to build the entrance to the new Archaeological Museum.It is an intervention that is not only cultural but profoundly developmental in nature. It is an intervention that has the potential to revitalise virtually the entire historic centre of the capital. And it is just one of the important cultural projects that will be launched in the next four years, along with the Museum of Maritime Antiquities in Piraeus, the conversion of Tatoi into a museum, the new Archaeological Museum of Elefsina.Of course, since we are talking about the field of culture and since so much noise was made about the professional rights of graduates, in 2025 there will be a Higher School of Performing Arts, with full professional rights and equal to graduates of universities. Because it will be effectively a university for graduates of performing arts schools.
