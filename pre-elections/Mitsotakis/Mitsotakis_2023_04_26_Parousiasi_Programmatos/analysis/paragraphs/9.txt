What is it that you see? Let's see. It is the Digital Work Card which is already being implemented, from 1 July 2022, in banks, in supermarkets with more than 250 employees, in insurance companies, in public utilities. Within the next four years it will be implemented in all companies and in the public sector. Today close to 200,000 employees use it.Why are we insisting so much on this tool? Because I keep hearing, especially from young people, "I cannot work overtime and not get paid for the work I do". The Digital Job Card puts an end to the abusive practices of employers and the exploitation of workers.It is an easy tool to fully record actual working hours, keep time, pay overtime. Our commitment is that within the next four years it will be extended to the entire public sector and the entire private sector, including small businesses.
