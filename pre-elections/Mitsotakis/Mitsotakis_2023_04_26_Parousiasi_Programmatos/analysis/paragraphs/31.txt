Our islands, the "GR-eco islands". It is an initiative which has secured funding resources. We have the ability to make the transition to green reality on our islands much easier than we can do in mainland Greece.See for example what is happening in Halki, one of the first islands to join the GR-eco islands programme. He put in a small photovoltaic system and suddenly the residents of the outlying Halki found that they were not actually paying any electricity bills, because there is substantial offsetting and the photovoltaic system produces enough energy to cover the energy needs of a small island.This should be the model for all Greek islands.This should be the model for all Greek islands. Combined with the increase in electromobility, with proper waste management, we have the potential within the next four years for our Greek islands to become leading players and I would say a model to be copied for how island Greece can become a global leader in green development.And of course, since we are talking about renewable energy sources, it is worthwhile to show you some comparative data. Don't go into too much detail on the numbers. Just keep in mind that during the four years of SYRIZA there was actually very little progress, while during the four years of the New Democracy there was progress that far exceeded the European average. And this is the path that must be continued.
