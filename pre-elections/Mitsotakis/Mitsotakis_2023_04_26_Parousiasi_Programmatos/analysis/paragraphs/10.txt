To talk a little bit about development, we could not fail to say a word about our tourism. Tourism went through an unprecedented ordeal in the years of the pandemic. Especially in 2020, when people practically stopped travelling, we found ourselves facing the spectre of the total collapse of the sector, which was and is to a large extent the "engine" of the Greek economy.The truth is that we have supported the tourism sector through coordinated actions, by using European programmes, by using resources from the state budget. But we also dared to take a series of initiatives that allowed us to be among the first to open up our tourism market, so that today we are in the happy position that 2022 will be a record year in terms of revenues from our main markets. 2023 is forecast to be even better. That didn't happen, it worked. The progress that we have achieved in tourism is in turn linked to a number of significant investments that are being made in tourism infrastructure, but also through the improvement in the remuneration of tourism workers themselves, who are receiving larger increases and higher wages than those provided for in old collective agreements - and certainly higher wages than the minimum wage. This is also a success; we have the potential to improve our tourism revenues very significantly and I believe that 2023 will give us a preview of what we can achieve from the sector which is currently, presumably, the most important sector for the Greek economy.
