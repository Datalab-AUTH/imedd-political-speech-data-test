But investment alone does not say much if it is not accompanied by good wages. And here we must emphasise that the average wage in our country, the average wage in the private sector, has increased significantly in the four years of our government. At the same time, of course, it is true that Greek society as a whole is being tested by a crisis of imported price competitiveness, but the challenge for us has always been how to support disposable income by increasing wages in connection with productivity and the growth potential of the Greek economy. We committed in 2019 that we would raise the minimum wage at twice the growth rate. We have exceeded this commitment. The minimum wage was EUR 650 and today it is EUR 780, a 20% increase, three additional wages per year. And our goal is to get the minimum wage to at least 950 euros at the end of the four years.
