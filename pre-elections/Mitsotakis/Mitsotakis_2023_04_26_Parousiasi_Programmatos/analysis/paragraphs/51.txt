I want to continue working for this Greece. At the service of the Greek citizens, with a tried and tested staff, a staff that has been "baked" and matured through the management of many crises.We know what we want to do. We know where we want to take the country. We are more ready, more mature than ever before. Give us the opportunity to go steadily, boldly, forward.Thank you very much.
