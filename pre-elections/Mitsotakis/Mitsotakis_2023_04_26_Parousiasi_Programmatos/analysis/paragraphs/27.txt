I have already spoken to you about transport: the upgrading of the transport fleet, the Thessaloniki Metro which will be operational in early 2024, the extension of Line 2 to the west.And of course I have spoken to you about the most important project that is currently underway, that is already underway, that we will need until 2029 to complete: none other than Metro Line 4, the most important public project currently underway in the country, but which, when it is operational, will serve more than 400 people.It is impossible, my friends, to plan the future mobility of our cities and to face the challenge of climate change at the same time without investing in public transport and especially in fixed railways such as the Metro. An extremely difficult project, an extremely expensive project, but absolutely essential if Athens is to remain a sustainable city that encourages mobility and environmentally friendly transport.
