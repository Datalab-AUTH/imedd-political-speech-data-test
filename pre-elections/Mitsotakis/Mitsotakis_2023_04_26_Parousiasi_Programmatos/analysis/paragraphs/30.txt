This is a picture of today, not a picture of the future. But it is a picture that we need to see more and more often. The country's largest photovoltaic park in the Ptolemaida area, a large wind farm.Greece already produces almost 50% of its energy from the sun and wind as we speak. We are a world leader, not only in Europe. We are one of the top ten countries in the world in the production of energy from renewable sources.But that is not enough. Our goal is to reach 80% of electricity production from renewables within the next four years. And these images need to become much more widespread. This is of particular importance both for our energy security and for the huge effort we have to make overall to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Think, friends, that in 2022 alone we paid â‚¬7 billion for gas imports. EUR 7 billion for a natural resource that we imported. We were also dependent on a third party who used energy as a geopolitical tool.This is the future. We have already foreseen ways in which siting can be made easier. But renewable energy should not only be about energy production, of course, but also about households themselves. "Photovoltaics on roofs", a programme that we want to run at high speed. But also to concern small producers, especially our farmers, who can now become much more competitive by producing electricity with small photovoltaic panels in the field.
