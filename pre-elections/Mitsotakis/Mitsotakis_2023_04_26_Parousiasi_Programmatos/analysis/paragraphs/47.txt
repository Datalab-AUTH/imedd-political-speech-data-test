I want to end the photos with this one. All the things I have talked about could not have happened if Greece had not had a strong voice abroad, respected by both allies and enemies.Greece counts abroad today. Its voice is heard, we are equal partners with our European partners, we are participating and co-shaping crucial European decisions. And it is precisely this prestige that the country has acquired that not only makes it stronger, but also makes it more prosperous economically.It is the necessary precondition for a Greece of progress, a Greece of growth, a Greece of social prosperity, as I envision it.
