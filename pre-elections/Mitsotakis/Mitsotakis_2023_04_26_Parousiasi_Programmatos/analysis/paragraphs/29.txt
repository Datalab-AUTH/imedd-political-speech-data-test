Let's go now to green and digital Greece or digital and green Greece. I don't need to say much here. It is the picture of yesterday and the picture not of tomorrow, but of today: 1.2 billion digital transactions in 2022. It was a big gamble that we were able to make and we won it.If any government, friends, has credibility when it talks about digital policies, it is the government of the New Democracy. Here we are talking about actions, about measurable results.And of course, I would like to stress that when we talk about the digitalisation of the state, it is not just the application that you see on your mobile phone. Behind the scenes, there is very serious work being done to enable us to streamline and simplify procedures.Take for example what has been done in the EFKA. We inherited a tragic situation: two and three years for pensions to come out.  We fought, we worked - the Ministry of Labour - with great dedication to tackle this problem. And today we can issue pensions in two months, as we had committed to; this is the standard for the entire public sector. So, digitisation of all government departments within the next four years.
