Fourth section, a just Greece. What do we mean by "fair Greece"? Apart from Justice, which I will talk to you about in a moment, I understand a just Greece as a Greece that leaves no one behind. Which gives equal opportunities primarily to our fellow citizens who need state care more than others.In this photo I am with Anna, the disabled girl and Elena, her Personal Assistant. It is the implementation of the "Personal Assistant" program, in which I have so much faith, for which I have fought so much, so that 1,000 of our fellow citizens with disabilities can have access to a person who will serve them, who will allow them to live their lives; but above all, it will free their families, their parents first and foremost, from this huge responsibility of having to take care of their child 24/7 and to take care of them. It is an extremely important intervention. That is how I understand justice in practice, equal opportunities for all Greek women and men. It is, let me remind you, a Recovery Fund programme, because we keep hearing that the Recovery Fund is 'for a few rich people'. This is the Recovery Fund in practice, because we have chosen to finance such actions from the Recovery Fund.
