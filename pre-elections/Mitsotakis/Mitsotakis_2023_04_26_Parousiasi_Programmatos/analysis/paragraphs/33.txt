Of course, we must also protect our unique natural environment. The "Apatity Mountains" are a global innovation. They are zones of absolute protection. We have designated nine mountains so far as "Apatity". This means that we can make practically no interventions. Yes, no wind turbines will be put in from one altitude upwards. Because this unique natural wealth must be protected and handed over to the next generation as we received it.
