So let's summarise our health interventions a little bit. I have talked to you about equipping hospitals, about the free personal doctor for all citizens, about the digital transformation of health care, but all this also requires people. We will increase by 10,000 the number of health workers. Primarily nurses, but also doctors, through a series of advertisements that are already being launched, so that we can absorb and not remove any of the workers who joined the National Health System during the difficult years of Covid.I want to make a special mention. We have already developed and will complete within the next four years an innovative mental health strategy with new structures. Mental health - and especially the mental health of children and adolescents - is a major challenge for the future and we must be ready to face it.I left one last intervention to which I personally attach enormous importance: free screening for all citizens. With the 'Fofi Gennimata' programme - as you know, it has already started - more than 130 000 women have already had a screening mammogram, either in a public or private facility. We went and found them, they did not come to us; of these, more than 7,000 were found to have breast cancer that they did not know they had. The chance of them doing well and being fully cured is very high, much higher once we have an early diagnosis.The new screening programme, the Doxiades programme, is expanding and will be completed within the next four years for a number of diseases.
