In 2019 I spoke about my will to turn Greece into a vast construction site. Indeed, today, projects worth â‚¬22.5 billion are underway across the country. In 2015-2019, 3.5 billion worth of projects were put out to tender. From 2019 to 2023, 14 billion were put out to tender.These are just three of the tens of hundreds that I could show you: the airport in Kastelli, Crete; the most modern airport in the Mediterranean, which will be ready in 2026; the Amvrakia Odos, which will be completed within the next year and will bring Lefkada and Vonitsa closer to the Ionian Road. And of course the E65, a road that will bring Western Macedonia out of isolation, connecting it with Thessaly, with Central Greece. A project which was practically 'clinically dead' when we came into the picture, we managed to unblock it and secured funding from the Recovery Fund to enable it to be completed.
