Public and state. Here, apart from the Digital Job Card, let me talk a little bit more experientially about the way we manage human resources in the public sector.When Antonis Samaras entrusted me with the "electric chair" of the Ministry of Administrative Reform, in 2013, in addition to the obligations we had to fulfil towards our creditors at that time, I had set an ambitious plan in motion: to explain to Greek society why the concept of evaluation is a self-evident obligation of any public administration. Today, however, this concept is now well established. So, evaluation everywhere, for all civil servants, with reward systems, productivity bonuses, better training, selection of administrations according to professional criteria. But also opportunities for improvement for civil servants who are not performing. And of course, a new central authority for speeding up, transparency and streamlining public procurement, within the framework of European law.We have been delayed in public tenders, we know that, we need to review the framework as a whole. And to the extent that we are obliged to comply, as we must, with European legislation, we must further simplify these procurement procedures, which are so delayed.
