I have already spoken to you about education, about the all-day school. We want to reach 150 Model and Experimental Schools. And of course, under the single pay scale, we will have an increase in the salaries of our teachers, who we are asking to do more and we need to reward them better.Of course, the first of the student residences that we are launching will be completed, so that our universities will finally be able to provide decent accommodation for our students. We will use the financial tool of PPPs and within the next four years we will be able to provide free accommodation for 8 500 students in a number of Greek public universities.
