Welcome to the presentation of the programme for the next four years of the New Democracy. Today, we will attempt to do something different from the usual presentations, the usual speeches, a list of measures. Rarely, you know, are these programmes read by the citizens. So, today I will attempt to tell you a story, how I envision Greece in four years, a story that started four years ago, when we basically laid the foundations for the Greece we envision. I think that we listened with great interest to the - I believe - objective statements of five young people, who described to us the important steps of progress that have been made and the great leaps that need to be made so that our country can truly become a European country. It is about these great leaps that I want to talk to you today. But these leaps require a solid foundation. They are the foundations that we laid in the first four years of the New Democracy. You remember that in 2019 I also told you that Greece cannot be changed in four years, and I still believe that this is true. But we have made very important steps forward and these steps forward must be continued. The dilemma of whether to go forward or to turn back is more relevant today than ever.
