But, you know, when we talk about investment, we are not only talking about technology, innovation, biotechnology. There is another category of investment that we have attached an extremely high importance to, and this photo is at the Syros shipyards. When I went and spoke to the workers four years ago, these shipyards were practically dead, with one tank that had practically sunk. At that time, there were 180 workers working in Syros. The company owed them wages, if I am not mistaken, of about ten years. Now in Syros we have 600 workers. The Greek shipping industry is rushing to send its ships to this shipyard for repair, and of course it is not the only shipyard that has been revived in our time.In Elefsina we currently have 600 workers, who, in a very moving event organised by the Ministry of Development, told their personal stories. How difficult it is to see your company essentially collapse and suddenly an investor comes along, to be able to get back to work, to be able to feed their families and, above all, to have the pride of doing something they really love. Elefsina can reach 2,000 employees.And of course, let's not forget the case of Skaramagas. Another painful story. Another "Gordian knot" that we have managed to untie. Today, Skaramagas is now in the hands of a private owner. A shipyard with enormous potential, which can add significant value to our Navy and to our merchant shipping. I estimate that Skaramagas will make more than 700 new hires in the next year.Just three examples - I could have had too many - of investments that are already underway in our country.
