This photo is from the reception of one of the first six Rafale aircraft delivered by our Air Force. I want to point out that investing in the country's deterrent capabilities is a sacred obligation of any Greek government. It will always be done with respect for the taxpayer's money.We have been able to make important purchases, as you have seen and as you remember from the beginning of the presentation, without putting pressure on public finances to the point of leading to difficult situations.But we still have ahead of us - and it is imperative that it be implemented in the next four years - a very important programme to further strengthen the Armed Forces. Twenty-four Rafale have already been purchased; they will have been delivered within this year. The upgrade of 83 F-16s to Viper version will be completed by 2027; this is the first Belharra frigate which is already being built at the French shipyard in Lorian. We will have taken delivery of three Belharra frigates by 2027 and the obligation, the first major decision of the next government, will be to acquire three additional corvettes, two of which will be built in Greek shipyards.
