To conclude with the major projects. Many are already underway and the next four years will be the four years of their completion. As an indication, here are 10 projects that will either be fully completed or in the process of completion.If I had to pick one of them, it would be the Thessaloniki Metro. The Thessaloniki Metro, which was so fought over by many people, who claimed that we cannot build a metro and protect the city's cultural heritage at the same time. All the trains have already been received, we are in trial operation. And, most importantly, the amazing cultural wealth at the Venizelos station is beginning to be put back in place, as we had committed to. And Metro, well, and ancient in early 2024.
