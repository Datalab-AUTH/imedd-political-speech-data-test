Violence against women. A big problem that came to the surface in such an intense way, with tragic situations and tragic incidents that we had to manage.We already have 18 new Domestic Violence Offices in the Greek Police. We will expand them significantly. We will train more than 1,000 police officers to be able to deal with such situations.We now have the "Panic button", which we want to expand very drastically. A tool, that is, in which a woman who is in an environment where she may be a victim of abuse will be able to alert - without the abuser knowing - the police. But also a support structure in case she feels threatened.And of course, the SOS 15900 line. We have double the number of women who have contacted "15900" since 2019 and have received meaningful help. No woman alone, no woman will live in fear.
