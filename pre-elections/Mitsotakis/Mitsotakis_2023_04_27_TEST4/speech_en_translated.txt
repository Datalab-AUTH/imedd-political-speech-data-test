Young Democrats of Xanthi and Thrace, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for such an impressive reception. You know how happy I feel every time I am with you, especially here in Xanthi, in Thrace, my joy is twofold. I always get strength when I meet our locals. But also when I am in this dynamic place, capable of playing a leading role in the whole country.The beautiful space of this amphitheatre is proving today to be too small to house your enthusiasm. And we, you see, have no difficulty in filling such places and starting the speeches on time.

Let me tell you a little story. Mr Tsipras came to my place, Chania, and he said he would speak in the same square where I had spoken. The speech was for seven and a half and he went to seven and a half and he went to eight and a half and he took the podium at eight forty, because half the square was empty.
