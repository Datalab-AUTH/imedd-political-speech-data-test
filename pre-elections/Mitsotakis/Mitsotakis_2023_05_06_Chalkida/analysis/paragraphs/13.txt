So the elections that are coming, friends, will be an opportunity to debate, as I said, our vision for the next day.We have presented our programme. I will not talk about it in detail. I will just tell you that our programme is based on the basic premise that if we are to be truly European, we have to continue to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of Europe, to finally catch up with the rest of Europe and get to the point where we can claim our salaries, our earnings, to be truly European salaries.
