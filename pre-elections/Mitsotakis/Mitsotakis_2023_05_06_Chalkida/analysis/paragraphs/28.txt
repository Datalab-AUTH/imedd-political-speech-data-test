But thanks also to the new friends, the young guys who are with us, from the section of Psakhi, which sections of Psakhi have taken over again. These are the universities of the future that we envision, universities that young children will enter and be rewarded for their efforts. They will not, in fact, all get in without exams.SYRIZA has told us that they want to abolish the minimum entry requirement, to get all children into universities. Soon he will tell us that he also wants to abolish exams in universities. Soon he will tell us that along with university admission he will also give young children a pension.That is not my vision for the youth, that is not my vision. I want competitive universities, children who can excel in universities. I want good technical education for the kids who don't get into universities, so that they too can get a good job.
