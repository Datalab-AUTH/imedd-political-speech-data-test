I cannot say enough about the way we dealt with a truly devastating fire. The Governor remembers well how difficult those days were, in the summer of 21, when we were faced with a firestorm. We took stock of what we should have done better and corrected many things in the Civil Protection and Fire Brigade. But we had to bend over in northern Evia and ease the pain of those people who saw their livelihoods destroyed overnight.
