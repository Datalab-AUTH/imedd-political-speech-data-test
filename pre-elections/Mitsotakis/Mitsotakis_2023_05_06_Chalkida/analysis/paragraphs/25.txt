I want us to rebuild together this great progressive current of patriotism and creative modernisation that was built in 2019 and will be reinvigorated now to give us a similar, if not better, result. To be able to have the strong political legitimacy to make the big changes; we need stability and determination. We do not need unstable coalition governments where one undermines the other. That is the last thing we need today.
