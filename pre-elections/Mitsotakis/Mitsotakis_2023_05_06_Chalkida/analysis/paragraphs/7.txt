All this is a very brief summary of a four-year project. I could go on at great length about what we have done. But I am only mentioning them by way of illustration because I want to show how important it is to be consistent in words and deeds in politics, to keep to what you have committed yourself to. Because I want to talk more about what we have to do from now on, not what we have done. Because every election must be an election for the future, not for the past.
