We were the ones who stood by people with disabilities. As I was coming, a disabled gentleman thanked me and said, "thank God someone thought of us". We have increased disability benefits by 8%. We are starting the Personal Assistant and we want to implement it for severe disabilities. We have made the interventions in the CEDAs so that they are digital and our disabled citizens are not inconvenienced by having to go back and forth for bureaucratic procedures at the CEDAs.
