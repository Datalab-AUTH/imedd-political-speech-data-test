But I also told you something else, that I would keep the country safe, that I would protect the borders and that Greece would be a "closed vineyard" in the past. That we would support our Armed Forces, that we would make investments, because national independence is not subject to discounts.I have just come from the inauguration of a wonderful War Museum - it is really worth seeing - and I was impressed. It is another important addition to Chalkida as a destination in its own right and I was thinking, through this 200-year history, how important these interventions that we are making today to support our Armed Forces, to get new planes, the Rafale, which are taking off from nearby, from Tanagra, you see them flying over Evia a lot.All these were important interventions that have strengthened the country's footprint, with a voice that is now heard from Congress to Brussels. A self-confident Greece that is no longer a beggar but a participant in European developments.
