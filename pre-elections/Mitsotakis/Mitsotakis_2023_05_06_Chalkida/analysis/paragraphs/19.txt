But, friends, in order for all this to happen, in order to return to the great political dilemmas, there is one condition: the condition is that New Democracy is powerful in the ballot box on May 21, that we continue the work that we have been doing for four years, because that is the dilemma of the elections: whether we continue to move forward or whether we roll backwards. Whether we will continue on a growth path with better jobs, lower unemployment, lower taxes, or whether we will return to policies of overtaxing the middle class - you remember them well - and whether we will continue to support pensioners.
