Either we are talking about Renewable Energy Sources, which, however, will always - I will stress this - be done with respect for the environment and always with the consent of the local communities, so that we don't have misunderstandings and conflicts of interest.But Renewable Energy Sources are very important. Consider that we want to go to 80% of electricity production from the sun and wind. Do you know what that means? That we don't have to be dependent on gas imports from Russia as we used to be. We have paid seven billion euros to import gas in 2022 alone; we want to have energy that we produce ourselves, that is environmentally friendly and, of course, that is much cheaper. Here, in Evia par excellence, you are leading the way in renewable energy and I want you to continue. We can continue on this path, for the benefit of the national economy and local communities.
