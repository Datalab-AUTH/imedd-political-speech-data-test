We need to make up for lost ground and we need to run faster. We know how to do it, we have laid the foundations, we have taken Greece forward.  We have learned from our mistakes. I never hid, friends. And in the catastrophic fires in Evia, I stood in front of the cameras, took my share of responsibility and said, 'we have weaknesses here, we have to fix them', because that is how I understand the concept of political responsibility. The Prime Minister does not hide when things are difficult. Nor does he put on a camera show like some others have done. Let us not go back to other times that we want to forget.
