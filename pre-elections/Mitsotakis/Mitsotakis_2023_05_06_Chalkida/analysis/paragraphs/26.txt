Watch out, in a week Turkey has elections. And a second election, probably on May 28th. We don't know what will happen with our neighbour. We have a good period now, but things could get difficult again the next day.The question is, who should manage a difficult neighbor in a difficult neighborhood. Who will ultimately defend the country's national sovereignty and sovereign rights? Who will be able to build the alliances that will enable our country to truly feel strong and secure.Our world is a very complicated one. And the difficulties, unfortunately, will not be absent in the day ahead.
