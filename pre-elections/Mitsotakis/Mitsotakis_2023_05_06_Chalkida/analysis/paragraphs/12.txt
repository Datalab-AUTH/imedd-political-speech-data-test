And I don't think there has ever been a faster and more systematic response, both in terms of compensation and in terms of our vision for northern Evia, with a comprehensive plan that is already starting to pay off. You see the traffic in northern Evia, how much it has increased. And of course, of all the important things we are doing for North Evia, I will single out just one: it is the road that will bring North Evia out of isolation. The studies of the road are already underway, they are in the Court of Audit. It is my personal commitment. Just as I gave you a commitment that I would find a solution to the problem of the Chalkida bypass, I am now giving you a commitment that the road linking Chalkida, central Evia, with northern Evia will become a reality and will be made a reality by our government.
