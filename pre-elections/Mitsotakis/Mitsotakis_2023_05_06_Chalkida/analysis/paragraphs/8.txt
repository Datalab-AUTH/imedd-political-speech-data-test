I'm opening a parenthesis. I see our political opponents for 48 hours now fighting like roosters over the political legacy of Andreas Papandreou and what happened in 1981. This debate is not our concern. We are talking about the Greece of 2023, about the Greece of 2027, about how to cut taxes, how to bring jobs, how to make our society fairer, how to strengthen the National Health System. How we will launch a series of major projects that concern, here, especially in Evia, in Chalkida.
