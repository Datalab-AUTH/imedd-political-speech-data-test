That is why experience and stability are so important. We have been tested in difficult times, we have been through fire and iron, we have learned from our mistakes, and today we are more experienced, more determined, more ready to move forward, to take Greece even faster, even more boldly forward.And I want you, the old fighters of New Democracy, from the times of Constantine Mitsotakis and before, to be my fellow participants and competitors in this struggle that we are going to give, the old fighters of New Democracy, from the times of Constantine Mitsotakis and before. Thank you for your support.
