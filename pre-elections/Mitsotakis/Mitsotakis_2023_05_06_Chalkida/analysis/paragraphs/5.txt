I told you that I will always stand by society in every difficult moment. Indeed, during the coronavirus we spent more than 50 billion euros to support Greek society and Greek entrepreneurship.All the shops here that you see today, which are bustling with life, you remember, we had to close them during Covid. But we came in and paid salaries, covered rents, gave a refundable deposit, kept them alive. Just so that they can grow today, hire people and in turn contribute to the dynamic growth that we have initiated.
