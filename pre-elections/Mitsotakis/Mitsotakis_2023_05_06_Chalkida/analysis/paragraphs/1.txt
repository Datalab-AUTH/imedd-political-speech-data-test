Thank you very much for this very nice welcome. One thing I can say, we have a lot more people today than the last time I spoke in Chalkida. This says something about the elections of 21 May and the results of Evia.Friends, Mr. Regional Governor, Madam Mayor, it is with great pleasure that I visit once again the island of Evia and a city that I love very much.
