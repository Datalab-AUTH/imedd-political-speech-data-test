Therefore, I would like to ask you here in Chalkida to fight this battle together. We are doing well, you can see it, I can feel it, but I do not want there to be any complacency.We have 15 days left, we have 15 days left, and we must claim every vote that we can win. The stronger we are on the evening of 21 May, the more emphatic the message will be that in the next four years New Democracy must again be self-reliant for a strong and self-reliant Greece, because there is practically no other alternative to power.So let us go and find our fellow citizens who have not yet decided what they want to vote for. Let us ask them to take the step of trusting us. I often meet such citizens wherever I go. As you can see, I travel all over Greece and I make many speeches, I talk to people. Many people come and say to me, "We didn't vote for you in 2019. We will now vote for New Democracy." And it's an important vote of confidence.
