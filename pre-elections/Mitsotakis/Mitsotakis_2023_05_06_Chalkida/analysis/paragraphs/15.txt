We are the ones who have supported all of you in this difficult period with imported precision, with a series of interventions such as the "Household Basket", such as the "Market Pass". We did not say that we can tackle a global accuracy problem and make it disappear with "one law and one article". Others say that. You will never hear a lie from me. I will always tell you what we can do, and what we can do is to continue to support society, especially the most vulnerable, for as long as this wave of imported precision lasts.
