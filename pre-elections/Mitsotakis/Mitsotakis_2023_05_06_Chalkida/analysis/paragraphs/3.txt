I must tell you that I am here today 15 days before the crucial elections of 21 May. I am absolutely sure that both Chalkida and Evia will send a message of victory in these elections. A message of victory, a message of stability, a message of progress, a message of self-confidence, for a strong Greece, which must continue on the road that we have been on for these four years, a road that, as you know, has had many difficulties, many sharp turns without the appropriate "signalling". We have managed many crises over these four years. From the coronavirus crisis, the refugee invasion in Evros and on our islands, an aggressive neighbour, a war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, many natural disasters, the traumatic experience of the Euboea fires in the summer of 2021.But despite the difficulties, I am proud because we kept the country standing, we supported society and Greece today is stronger than it was in 2019. And we did all this while implementing all the axes of our government's programme.
