And of course one more thing, a very strong emphasis on health issues. I lived through the pandemic myself as Prime Minister, we all became experts on health issues. We managed to keep the country on its feet, the NHS showed its strengths, but it also showed its weaknesses. The next four years will be the four years of structural interventions in the National Health System; I do not accept that a person will wait six and twelve months for a scheduled surgery. I do not want to hear again that we have shortages of nurses and doctors when we can hire people and we can hire them faster.I will make 10,000 health care hires-nurses and doctors-in the next four years and I will move heaven and earth so that these hires are made quickly and do not get stuck in the cogs of bureaucracy.We will support primary care, important in Evia. Health centres, 156 health centres, will be rebuilt with Recovery Fund resources. We will rebuild all the emergency departments in our major hospitals.We will expand preventive screening. For the women who are with us-you know how important it is right now-for the first time women got a message from the state and we said to them, "Go get a screening mammogram, see if there's anything you don't know about," and we identified 7,000 women who had breast cancer and didn't know about it. Now they can be cured much more quickly and much more effectively because we detected it early.So all of this adds up to an overall vision of health for the next decade, of how I see a National Health System that really stands by the citizen in their most difficult moments.
