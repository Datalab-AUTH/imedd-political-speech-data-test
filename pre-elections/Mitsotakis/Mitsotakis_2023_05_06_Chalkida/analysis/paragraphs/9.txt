It's true, you have every right to have every complaint about central government, over time, I would say. You are so close to Athens and yet so far away. And of course, I cannot forget that this bridge, the beautiful bridge that I crossed once again, was the work of Constantine Mitsotakis. Some of you may have been at the inauguration - which was stressful, as I recall - but I believe that I too can now identify my name, the name of our government, with an equally important project for Chalkida: the Chalkida bypass has been contracted, the construction site will start in June. It is the most important infrastructure project for the city of Chalkida.I must tell you that we were pushed very hard - the regional governor and the mayor know that - to be able to get it out of the way, to get the relevant European approvals. It is a project that will cost more than EUR 200 million. But it will come to fruition and will provide substantial relief for the whole city of Chalkida, but it will also contribute to the development of the whole of Evia as a whole.
