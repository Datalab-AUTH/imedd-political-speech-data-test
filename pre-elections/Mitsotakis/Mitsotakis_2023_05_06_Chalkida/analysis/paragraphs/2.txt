I want to start by telling you how good and productive our cooperation has been over these last four years with both the Regional Governor and the Mayor. I stress this level of cooperation because I am well aware that a number of problems cannot always be solved by the central state. They have to be solved at the level of the Region and at the level of the Municipality and the truth is that, for the first time, I would say, in the history of local government, the Regions and the Municipalities had to manage such important funds, but they put them to work for the benefit of your citizens, for the benefit of the Region. That is why I would say that I am extremely satisfied.
