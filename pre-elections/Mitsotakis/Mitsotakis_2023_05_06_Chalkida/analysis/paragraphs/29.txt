I want us to look to the future and not to the past. We know where we want to take Greece, we know that this Greece deserves and can do much better. Give me the strength to take Greece where it deserves to be.Be well, thank you very much. Good race, good strength and good luck again here in Chalkida, winners after the great election victory of May 21. Be well, good strength.
