And a word about digital Greece. gov.gr was a revolution in the way the state communicates with its citizens, and this effort will continue, and by 2027 the whole state will be digital. No more hassles, no more queues, no more delays. Of course, this also means investing in the human resources of the state. We will also increase the salaries of civil servants. Five hundred million more in the single payroll. But at the same time we will have demands. Evaluation everywhere and for everyone. I am not backing down from this commitment. Everyone is evaluated and everyone is judged and everyone, ultimately, must be rewarded for the work they do. These, my friends, are the key issues that we will have to address from now on.
