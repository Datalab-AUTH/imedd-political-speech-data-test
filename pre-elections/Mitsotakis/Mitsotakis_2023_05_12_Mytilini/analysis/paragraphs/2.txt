I remember, friends, when I came to visit the "hellhole" of Moria, I had to enter with a platoon of riot police, when you had more than thirty thousand illegal immigrants, asylum seekers, here on your island and when the image in the market, where I had walked, was one of despair. I saw the desperation in your eyes then and I was committed, I looked you in the eye and said 'I will take care of this problem'. And I did. We protected our borders, because Greece has borders on land and sea. And it has an obligation to guard them.I would like you, friends, to give your loudest applause to the women and men of our Coast Guard, who carry out the difficult task of guarding the borders day and night, with absolute respect for human rights, having saved thousands of people at sea.
