The whole Aegean Sea is blue and all of Greece will be blue on the evening of May 21. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you for this impressive reception and a big thank you to our ONNED, to our AAP, to our youth. I am always happy when I visit Mytilene. But today, I am doubly happy because I see that your beautiful island has now definitely and irrevocably turned the page. We have left the difficult days of the refugee crisis behind us and Lesvos looks to the future with optimism.
