But we sent a message from day one: that Greece, which was a reception centre for migrants, is now a thing of the past. More than 600 thousand illegal immigrants had passed through your island during the four years of Syriza. In our days it is less than ten thousand.The "hellhole" of Moria no longer exists. The site has been given to the Municipality, the private land has been returned to its owners and I look forward to my next visit, as Prime Minister of the country, to inspect the important educational, cultural and recreational projects that will be carried out at this site.
