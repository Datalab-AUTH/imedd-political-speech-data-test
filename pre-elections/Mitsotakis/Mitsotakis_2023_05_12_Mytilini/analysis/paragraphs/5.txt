You know better than I do whether I kept the commitments I made to you, whether I respected the contract of trust that I asked you to sign in the July 2019 elections. And I kept my commitments and - above all - I kept the country safe against all the crises it faced and had to manage. We have not only shielded our borders, we have also strengthened our national defence, so that we are now sending a message to those who may think of challenging our sovereignty and our sovereign rights to think again.
