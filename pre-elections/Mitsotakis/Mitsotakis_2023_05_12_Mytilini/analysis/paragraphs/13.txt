Simply put, the dilemma is whether to keep going forward or to turn back. Whether we continue to cut taxes and raise incomes or go back to policies of overtaxing the middle class. Whether we will continue to increase the pensions of pensioners, as we did, or whether we will return to the times of the Katrougalos law, the one that crushed your pensions. Some people think that we will forget all that. Whether we will continue with a policy that guards our borders or whether we will return to open border policies. Whether we will continue to invest in our Armed Forces or whether we will pursue other geopolitical pursuits away from our traditional allies.
