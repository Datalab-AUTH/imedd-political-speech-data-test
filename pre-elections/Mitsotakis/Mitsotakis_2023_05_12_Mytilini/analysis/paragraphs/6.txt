But because we will have elections in Turkey in two days from now, I want to stress that the next elections are not only about the economy, not only about health, not only about the welfare state, not only about the primary sector. They are also about the country's foreign relations. Today Greece is much stronger than it was in 2019. Our Armed Forces are shielded and you, I am sure, feel much more secure when you know - you may not see them, but you can be sure and confident that they are somewhere above us - when the Rafale is now flying over the Aegean, when the upgraded F-16s are flying over the Aegean, when three new frigates will soon be added to our fleet. This is how a state strengthens its national deterrent capability. And know that we will continue to do so for the next four years without any discount. And without at the same time jeopardizing the country's fiscal objectives. We have proven that finances can be tidy and national defense can be supported at the same time. And that is what we will continue to do.
