And a word about the green and digital Greece that I envision. The challenges are ahead of us, friends, in terms of climate change. They are here. We know that it is a reality that we have to face. But we also know that as a country we do not want to be dependent on anyone for energy imports. We paid seven billion euros in 2022 for gas imports alone. As we boost solar and wind generation, we will produce cheaper energy and reduce our geopolitical dependencies. At the same time, I want to support all households so that they can reduce their energy footprint and ultimately pay lower electricity bills. The 'Change Water Heater' programme, for example, was launched, opened with great success. All of the 'Save money' programmes will continue. These are programs that support household disposable income because they ultimately lower the bills that you all would pay.
