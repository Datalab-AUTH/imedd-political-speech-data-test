But, friends, the next four years will primarily be the four years in which we will have to continue the important work that we have started in these four years. In the economy we have made important steps. We are running at a growth rate much higher than the European average and this enables us to have those surpluses to support society against imported precision. I know that precision is still a problem that is plaguing us all. I also know very well that the problem of precision is not only addressed by means of emergency allowances. The Market Pass is very useful as a temporary relief, but the permanent solution to the problem of accuracy cannot be other than to increase wages for all and to support the disposable income of households. We are the ones who took the minimum wage from EUR 650 to EUR 780. We are the ones who will take the minimum wage to EUR 950 and the average wage to EUR 1 500. And remember: inflation will come down at some point. You can already see that it is already starting to decelerate. But wage increases and tax cuts are permanent. The income of Greeks will be permanently supported through a growth policy that only we, my friends, know how to launch today for our country.
