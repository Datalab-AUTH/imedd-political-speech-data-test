This, my friends, is just one indication of how Greece has turned the page in these four years. How much progress we have made, despite the great difficulties we have had to face. How today we really do have the right - both here in the North Aegean and in the territory as a whole - to look to the future with greater optimism. We have implemented our election programme. We have reduced taxes, we have reduced contributions, we have created jobs, we have supported the whole territory and especially here, the North Aegean, with important development projects, which we will have the opportunity to present later on. But we have also supported society, businesses and workers against all the crises that have befallen us. Ask the shopkeepers in the pedestrian precinct here what support they received from the state in the difficult days of the pandemic. We spent more than EUR 45 billion to keep businesses open, to pay wages, to give refundable and non-refundable advances. That is why we have this picture here in Mytilene today. We supported all of you against the imported precision with extraordinary subsidies on electricity. We supported our islands by demanding and achieving low VAT for all the islands that were hit by the refugee problem. That is why today we have every reason to be able to look to the future with optimism. And with only nine days from now until the national elections on 21 May, the real issue is to talk about the future, not the past.
