So, friends, I come back to the crucial dilemmas of the ballot box which will open in nine days from now. You see, wherever I go - I came here this morning from an amazing rally that we held in Volos, I drove across Thessaly yesterday - New Democracy has a strong positive current. Old, traditional, traditional fighters are uniting in our party. I want to thank each and every one of you individually, because I know that you have kept our party standing in difficult times. I would also like to thank the good old friends of Constantine Mitsotakis, he had many friends here on your island and some of them are certainly among us. But I want to welcome new friends to our big political family. Some who joined us in 2019, who trusted us, who did not belong to New Democracy. And some who are thinking of standing with us for the first time in this election because they see, they judge and they compare and they can see the work of the previous government that ruled the country from 2015 to 2019 and they can compare it with the work of our government, what we have done in the last four years.
