But the next four years will not only be the four years of growth, it will also be the four years of a strong social Greece. Let me make a special mention of the very great importance I attach to supporting the National Health System. Today is World Nurses' Day. I want to say a very big thank you to all the workers of the National Health System who fought together to tackle an unprecedented pandemic. But we know that the National Health System needs more support. Ten thousand recruitments will be made over the next four years, four thousand of which will be nurses. I want to be absolutely sure that all the health structures in our country, not only in mainland Greece but also on our islands, are properly staffed. That there are no delays in order to have a regular surgery. That the outpatient departments of our hospitals will be able to receive patients with speed and dignity. That our health centres, which are so important, will be rebuilt and strengthened. All of these are priorities, personal priorities, for me in my second four years. Please know that because I keep my commitments, four years from now Greece will have a different and much better National Health System than it has today.
