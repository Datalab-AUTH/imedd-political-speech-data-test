So that we too can send a message of strength to all our neighbours, that we are a strong country, we are a confident country. Allow me here to open a parenthesis and say something about an extremely unpleasant event that took place in our neighbour Albania this morning, where unfortunately the candidate for Mayor of Himarra and member of the Greek National Minority, Freddy Beleris, was arrested. I want, here from Lesvos, to send a message to our friend Albania. Greece will not accept any discounting of the rule of law and the protection of the rights of the Greek National Minority. If Albania wants to move closer to the European Union, it has an obligation to ensure free and fair municipal elections and to immediately release those whom it has imprisoned so that they can participate in the electoral process.
