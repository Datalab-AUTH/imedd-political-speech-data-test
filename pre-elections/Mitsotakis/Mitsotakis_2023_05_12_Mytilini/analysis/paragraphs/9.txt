A special talk about education, about our schools, about our universities. There is, you know, very important work going on in schools, which must continue. If you think about the fact that today kindergarten starts at four, our children are learning English at four, children in elementary school have the opportunity to take free zone classes that they never did in the past. Thirty-six thousand, hold that number, interactive digital whiteboards will be placed in every public school in the country, completely changing the way our children's education is delivered. For our universities, I'll just say a word about our universities. We support regional universities. We will continue to support them. We will enable them to take steps forward. To strengthen their infrastructure. To be able to connect to the local economy, to the local market. To provide our children with degrees that have real value and skills that will be useful tomorrow when they go out into the labour market.
