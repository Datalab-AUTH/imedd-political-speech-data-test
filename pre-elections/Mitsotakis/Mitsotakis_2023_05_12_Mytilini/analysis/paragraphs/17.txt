As I see a lot of youth here, I remembered something I was saying in the 2019 elections. I was talking to some young people at that time and I was saying, "look, I understand that you may not trust us in this election, but I want you to trust us in the next election because you will have assessed the work we have done." You see, at last, that there are politicians who keep their word, who do what they say and when they make mistakes they have the courage to look you in the eye and recognise their responsibility, learn from their mistakes and move forward. That is what accountability in politics ultimately means.
