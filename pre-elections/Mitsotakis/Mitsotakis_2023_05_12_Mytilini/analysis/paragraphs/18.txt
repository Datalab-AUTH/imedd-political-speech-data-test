A self-reliant island, a self-reliant North Aegean, a self-reliant New Democracy, a self-reliant Greece. That is what is at stake here. So think about it, two Members of Parliament here from New Democracy, that is the goal. What the others do, as you can see, is of no interest to me. What we do is what we are interested in, what we do between now and the elections, what we do after the elections. But I also want to remind you of something: despite the fact that we have the whole current with us, the last days until the elections are always the most critical. Don't forget something. When the polls open on the morning of May 21, they will be empty, not a single ballot will have been dropped in. But when the polls close, they must be full of New Democracy ballots. I am sure that this will happen all over Greece, it will happen in the North Aegean, it will happen here in Lesvos, and you will ensure that the Aegean is blue, because blue is not only the colour of our party. It is the colour of the Aegean, it is the colour of the sky, it is the colour of the Greek flag, which flies high and proudly over the Aegean and over the whole country. Be well, have a good race, let's go for the great victory and may I return here with an upgraded and strong popular mandate to continue the great work we have begun.
