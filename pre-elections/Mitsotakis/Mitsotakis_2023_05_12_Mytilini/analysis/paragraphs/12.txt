I think that's what you are interested in after all. You are not interested in the toxicity that the opposition wants to reproduce, nor in issues that have nothing to do with the daily problems that you face.Be careful, I did not promise you miracles in 2019. I told you that I will work very hard to improve disposable income, to bring jobs, to raise the prestige of the country. And we have achieved all that. But the hard work is still ahead of us. The work we have achieved is important, but it is also fragile. That is why next Sunday's elections are so crucial. I would say it is perhaps the most crucial election since the post-independence period, and I don't say that by accident. I say it because on the other hand there is no real alternative to governance and the policies that our political opponents are proposing are bound to take the country way back.
