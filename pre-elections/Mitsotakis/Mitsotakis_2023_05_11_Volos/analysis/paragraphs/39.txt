And it is this message of unity and perspective. Greece will be blue on the evening of May 21, Constantine and Helen, it will be blue, just as our flag is blue, just as our party is blue.But I ask you to carry this message of unity and perspective everywhere, because you are the soul of the party. You live in society, you listen to its anxieties.I do not want you to forget, you see, the climate is very good, we are doing very well, but on the morning of 21 May the polls throughout the country will be empty when they open. And all political forces will start from the same starting point. Let's do everything we can to fill them with as many New Democracy ballots as possible. It's up to us; we are a great current today. This current was essentially born in 2019, born to change the country. My ambitions are high, I will not settle for mediocrity. I know how much we can achieve as a country and I know that we want to continue to build together the Greece we dream of.
