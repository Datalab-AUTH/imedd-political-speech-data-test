And that is why I put as an absolute political priority the unlocking of the landmine called simple proportional representation, a trap that SYRIZA has left the country, essentially betting on ungovernability. It is a trap that today, as we approach the elections, is becoming increasingly threatening. With voices that want to make the euro "Executioners", with others talking about, what did they say? "These are views that Mr Tsipras does not exclude from a possible alliance tomorrow, at the same time that Mr Androulakis' PASOK does not want the Prime Minister to be the one who will be voted for by the citizens, but an "unknown X" whom he knows but does not tell us. He will announce him to us later along with some ministers.And in the midst of all this, some people are trying to baptize themselves as winners or losers. And to make a government of tolerance -consent - as they call it.
