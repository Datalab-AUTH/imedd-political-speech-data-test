For the armouring of our defences, you already know the answer. I have a personal love for our Air Force. I had the great pleasure of serving here in 111 AM all my military service, in what was then one of the first two F-16 squadrons, 346, which has now been renamed 347, and I knew from the moment I came on the job that there was a significant imbalance in the air, and look, four years ago Turkey was ready to take delivery of the first of the 100 F-35s it had ordered. Where are we today, just three and a half years later? Greece has already acquired 24 state-of-the-art Rafale fighters. Our F-16s are being upgraded to a Viper version and from 2028 we will add to our air force the most modern 5th generation aircraft, the F-35.
