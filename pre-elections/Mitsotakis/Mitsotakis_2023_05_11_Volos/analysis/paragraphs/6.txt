And where are we today? Where are we today? We are paying fifty less taxes and lower contributions. From your shoulders, from the shoulders of the Greeks, a tax burden of seven billion euros has been removed. ENFIA has been reduced, not by 30% as we said, but by 35%. And from now on it will be reduced by a further 10% for all houses insured against natural disastersThe tax rate has been reduced from 22% to 9%. The solidarity contribution was abolished across the board. The tax on farmers was reduced to 50% for cooperatives. While parents can finally transfer their property to their children for free.But that's not all we did. We spent more than 55 billion, 57 billion to be precise, to deal with the imported crises of pandemic and energy costs, supporting the economy, society and work. At the same time, however, we have stimulated growth through well thought-out choices, we have reduced unemployment through investment, so this new wealth has finally returned to the citizen in the form of permanent increases.
