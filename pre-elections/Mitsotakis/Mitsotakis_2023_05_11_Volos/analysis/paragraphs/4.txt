But be careful, I'm not talking here about obstacles that could have been foreseen. Because unlike the crisis of 2015, which was created by the same people who now claim that they got us out of the memoranda, after they had put us in them first with their experiments for six months, all the crises that we were called upon to manage broke out far away from Greece. And yet we overcame them. We overcame them together. When other countries are still struggling to make up for the losses of those attacks, our Greece, our homeland not only gained the lost ground but made leaps and bounds. Two side-by-side pictures are enough: the Greece of 2023 is nothing like the Greece of 2019.
