Finally, two words about a strong Greece. I really regret that some people went to Brussels and asked the European Commission not to fund the Evros fence. I answer them: with or without European funds, the Evros fence will be completed; our Coast Guard will be strengthened. The arms programmes we are running will continue. Just as the exploration for our energy wealth will continue. This government, after ten and, years of inaction, was the first to do substantial exploration for natural gas southwest of Crete. And if there are serious indications that we have exploitable hydrocarbons, we will be the ones to go ahead and exploit them. Just as we have made Greece an energy hub, an important geopolitical player for the energy security of the Balkans.  All of this, friends, strengthens the geopolitical position of the country, makes us a strong player, a reliable player, a country with which everyone ultimately wants to talk, because they know how important we are for the security of the wider region.
