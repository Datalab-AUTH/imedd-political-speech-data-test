And all of this at a time when large, medium and small projects, Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayor, are progressing everywhere. The Metro in Athens, the largest project currently under construction in the country, the Metro in Thessaloniki. I will be in Thessaloniki next week, visiting the Metro, which will be delivered to the people of Thessaloniki in early 2024. As we had committed: both Metro and ancient, the most modern Metro in the country, but you see it around you, the country is basically turning into a big construction site. Patras-Pyrgos in the Peloponnese, the BOAK in Crete, the vertical axes of the Egnatia, the E65, which is so important for Thessaly, a road that would never have been completed, is becoming a reality as a result of the will of this Government.And this is the image of Greece that is changing, because Volos is changing, Magnesia is changing, Thessaly is changing. You remember, a few weeks ago we were here again to present 370 projects worth 4.3 billion in Larissa as part of our development plan for Thessaly of the future, for 2030. For the Thessaly you deserve; for our youth, new student halls of residence to house students in Volos. The court mansions, Mr. Mayor, in Volos, Karditsa and Trikala, the new bicycle path, the very important Museum of Argo which will start and will be built here in Volos, the renovation of the Municipal Theatre. We gave a solution to the issue of the municipal water supply and sewerage company of Volos, with debts that had been created by scandals of the past.And I know that there are two more issues that are very relevant to your city, which I am absolutely convinced that in a spirit of cooperation we will be able to deal with them: the issue of relocating the fire brigade from the city centre and the issue of re-drawing the land area of the harbour, so that the pending issue of the coastal park of Agios Konstantinos can finally be resolved.Volos is becoming a dynamic development city with a port which can become a new gateway for our city, to compete with the ports of Athens and Thessaloniki. A city which has such a dynamic history in both manufacturing and trade will once again find its rightful place on the development map of the country.
