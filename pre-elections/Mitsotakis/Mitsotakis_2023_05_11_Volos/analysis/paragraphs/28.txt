Two words about green Greece, which mirrors the energy independent Greece. In 2022, my friends, we paid seven billion euros for gas imports. Keep that number, seven billion euros. It is not only that it is expensive, it is that anyone can blackmail us. They can turn it on and off whenever they want, and we can then run around and not be able to meet our energy needs.That is why we are so insistent that we can and must achieve, by the end of the four years, 80% of our electricity generation from the sun, from the wind, from hydroelectricity. The Mesochora dam will be completed and will provide a significant help, with cheap hydroelectricity in our system.And of course, I want to stress how important all the energy upgrade programmes for households and businesses are. Today we opened the "Change Water Heater" program, with a tremendous response from citizens, why? Because these are all policies that ultimately reduce energy costs for households, businesses, farmers; we're going to have a lot more PV for farmers over the next four years. And of course, Mr. Regional Governor, we will complete the outstanding issues that we have with the waste management issues, the wastewater treatment centres, so that we really have a policy that protects the environment effectively.
