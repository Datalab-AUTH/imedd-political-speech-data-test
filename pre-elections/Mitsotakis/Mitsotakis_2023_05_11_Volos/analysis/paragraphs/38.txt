New Democrats, friends, on 21 May, yes, the citizens will finally choose the Prime Minister and the government they prefer. The stronger the strength of the former and the distance from the latter, the easier and more optimistic the next day will be. There is no room for frivolity in this election. Any mistake can annul our conquests and with them annul our tomorrow's claims. Mistakes, as you know, cannot be corrected once they are removed from the ballot box. Since every uncontested vote and every untimely so-called protest effectively leads to national weakness. The solution is another. You know it and you know it, and it is one: a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy. You know, the old divisions have faded in the light of experience. Progress and prosperity are blue in colour, but they are also the colour of truth and results. And this has been brought about by our Government, which has been able to and has expressed citizens beyond our party walls. And I am sure that many of them are among us today. They are people who voted for us for the first time in 2019. There may be people who will vote for us for the first time in this election in 2023; they are people who believe in responsible patriotism and creative modernization. That is why a self-reliant New Democracy will be an open, multi-powered New Democracy tomorrow. A party that will unite and not divide the Greek people.
