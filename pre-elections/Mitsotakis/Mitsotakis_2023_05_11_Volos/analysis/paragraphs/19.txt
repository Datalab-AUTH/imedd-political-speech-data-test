And that is why I want to share with you very soon my goals for Greece in 2027, which are encapsulated in this new programme of governance of New Democracy. Here you see only the summary of it, it is much more extensive, it is thoroughly costed. It will cost us 9 billion over four years, and all our proposals are set out in specific implementation timetables.And for me, the most important result of the relationship of trust that we have built over the years is precisely this: just as I told you what I would do four years ago and implemented it, so I can tell you with certainty that everything included in this programme can and will be implemented over the next four years.It is a visionary roadmap with five chapters. They describe the homeland we envision, the one described in as many words of its title. A productive, social, just, digital and green Greece. I always emphasise green, environmentally green, because Greece is blue and will be blue in the next elections and the map will be blue everywhere.
