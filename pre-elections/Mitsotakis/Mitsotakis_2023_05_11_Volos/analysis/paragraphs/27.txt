A fair Greece also means faster justice. We have made important steps in this direction, but we know that the administration of justice is still delayed. We will strengthen it with resources and personnel, we must achieve - within a four-year horizon - that the time it takes for judgments to be handed down is now close to the European average and that the Greek courts offer absolute legal security to anyone who wants to invest in our country, as well as a guarantee to every citizen that Justice is ultimately the refuge of weak citizens and that they will be able to find justice there.
