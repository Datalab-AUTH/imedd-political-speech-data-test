But there is another side of our shield and that is Greek diplomacy. The one that has achieved strategic defence agreements with France and the United States that have strengthened the country's diplomatic position. It is the one that extended our territorial waters to 12 miles in the Ionian Sea. It is the one that established maritime zones with Italy and Egypt, so that our national voice, the voice of our country, is now heard loudly everywhere, from the American Congress and Brussels to the Arab world.
