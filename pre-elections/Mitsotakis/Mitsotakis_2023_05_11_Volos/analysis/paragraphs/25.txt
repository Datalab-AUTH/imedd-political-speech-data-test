But, at the same time, to give an answer to the big problem that I keep encountering. Young children, young couples say to me, "we can't afford to buy a house, the rent is expensive, the very idea of owning a house is so far away that we can't imagine if we don't inherit a house from our parents how we're going to get out of rent".And we came up with the "My House" program and it's been hugely successful to date. Why? Young children, young couples can finally own a home and pay off a subsidized loan with a payment that would be much lower than the rent they would pay, only eventually the house will be theirs and they will own it. This is what housing policy with a social impact in practice means. And with many more interventions where we will need the cooperation of local government; social consideration. That's how much land the state has. On public land we will be able to build apartments, a part of which will be kept by developers, a part of which will be made available to young people. These are just some of the manifestations of our policy. We are immediately opening a new platform for young people who may have inherited from their parents an apartment that needs major repairs. Up to â‚¬30,000 for young people to be able to repair old apartments, to make them habitable again.
