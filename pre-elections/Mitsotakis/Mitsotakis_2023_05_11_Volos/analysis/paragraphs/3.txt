Friends, some people say that these elections are crucial. Wrong, they are the most crucial elections in recent years. Because they find us at a crossroads of choice.  Not between two parties that will rule for four years, but between two worlds that will determine the national course for a decade, either by continuing on the path of certainty and progress or by risking new adventures.We have learned well and truly that governance - we who have been tested in the throes of power this four years - is not an exercise in ideology, but in the successful management of circumstance. And think of how many crises we have gone through and overcome since 2019; in early 2020 we received and dealt with the migrant invasion in Evros and protected our borders. Then we had to deal with the worst pandemic of the last century, then a war on our continent, then a global price explosion. We constantly had to face national threats.
