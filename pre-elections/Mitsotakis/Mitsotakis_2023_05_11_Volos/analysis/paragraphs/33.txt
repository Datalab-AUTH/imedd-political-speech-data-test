The same applies to their central slogan. Look out, "Justice everywhere". "Justice everywhere" we read on all SYRIZA posters. Everywhere except, of course, for Mr. Tsipras' inner circle and his associates, starting with the 13-0 convict in the Special Court, Nikos Pappas. "Justice everywhere" does not apply there. Justice for SYRIZA is only good when it makes decisions with which SYRIZA agrees. But it is not worth talking too much about yesterday, and I will not do so between now and the elections, when the stakes of tomorrow open up before us. These are the stakes that concern me.
