And all this means that, ultimately, the average income is growing. In an economy that is growing. And it is growing much faster than the European average.Yes, in four years, look what we have achieved. We took over an economy that was growing at a quarter, look, a quarter of the European average. This is the economy that we took over. Today, the Greek economy is growing at twice the rate of the eurozone. This is the success of our economic policy. That is why the international rating agencies upgraded us 12 times, so that we reached investment grade. And this is a very important development, because it will allow the state, businesses and households to borrow on favourable terms. Investment grade, ladies and gentlemen, is not some neutral economic term that only concerns specialists. It is an engine of growth that increases the productivity and competitiveness of the country. In an environment of rising interest rates, it is important that we can borrow at the lowest possible borrowing costs.But beware, we will get the investment grade on one condition: that tomorrow we have a stable, reformist New Democracy government. And if that happens, yes, I guarantee you, we will get the investment grade before the end of the year.
