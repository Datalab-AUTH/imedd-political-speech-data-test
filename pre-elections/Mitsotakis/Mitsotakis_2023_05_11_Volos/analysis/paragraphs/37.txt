Don't forget, friends, in three days, on Sunday, we have elections in Turkey and the result of our ballot box will also be a message to the other side of the Aegean. Therefore, it must exude stability and solidity; at the same time, it must also declare our will: yes, that the Greeks in these difficult times want a strong and experienced hand at the helm of our country so that, as has been the case for four years now, the national ship can overcome turbulence and find calm waters, keeping its sails open in constant progress.The dilemma of the ballot box is therefore clear: do we go forward or do we go back? Do we want results or do we want to lie again? Do we want better wages and salaries or do we want taxes and cuts again? In short, do we want New Democracy with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis or Syriza with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras? We weigh, decide and vote.
