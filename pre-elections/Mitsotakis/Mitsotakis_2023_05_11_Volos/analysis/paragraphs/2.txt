You, friends, will give us this mandate. The mandate to change Greece once and for all, because some people who are here today, in Thessaly, a little further away in Larissa, are dreaming of power again, threatening us that "the second time will be different". Well, it will indeed be different, because everything is already different and it is certainly better than in the past. And let them come here from Volos to see that Magnesia, Greece, Thessaly, will say no a second time to disaster, giving with your vote a second strong mandate for progress.
