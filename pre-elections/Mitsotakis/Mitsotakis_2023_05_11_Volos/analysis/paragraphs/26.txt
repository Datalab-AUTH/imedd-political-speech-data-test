But I also want to talk a little bit about fair Greece, which is primarily aimed at the weakest. You know my sensitivity to people with disabilities. We were the ones who increased disability benefits, decoupled them from welfare benefits, and we are implementing the Personal Assistant, a flagship measure. In the first phase we opened the platform for the whole of Greece. 2,000 of our fellow citizens, people with severe disabilities, can now have a carer, a companion to accompany them in their personal and professional lives.This way, the state is becoming more social and more helpful, because we still have work to do in the public administration. I want you to know that I will never back down from one of my commitments: evaluation everywhere and for everyone. I repeat it: evaluation everywhere and for everyone, so that competent civil servants can be rewarded, can move up through the ranks more quickly, can have additional financial rewards.
