And on the other hand, we have heard positions from us, one can agree or disagree, but here there is a coherent programme with a beginning, a middle and an end. On the other hand, a chaos with proposals of supposed cooperation, from ultimately incompatible partners, with creepy views ranging from currency change to nationalisation of enterprises.Look, I really cannot follow this dangerous Babel of opposition that speaks in incomprehensible languages.

It is the one that will in practice prevent both ungovernability and paralysis from an incoherent partnership.
