And in the EFKA we proved that yes, when we want to, we can restructure troubled organisations. I am proud today to look pensioners in the eye and say to them: yes, your pension is finally coming out in three months at the latest and you don't have to wait two and three years to get your pension, for the state to do the obvious.But, we know, the tragedy in Tempe hurt us all and showed us that many things have to change. And it has made me even more determined to confront attitudes and logics that belong to the past and do not suit us as a country. That is why the steps we have taken must be taken in the second four years in leaps and bounds.
