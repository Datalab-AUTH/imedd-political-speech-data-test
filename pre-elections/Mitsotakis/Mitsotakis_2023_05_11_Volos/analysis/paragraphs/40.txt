To prevent the demolition of what has been conquered. To give perspective to what we can achieve. And this is the message that I ask you, today, to travel it to every city, every village, every district, every house in Thessaly, with you as messengers.And especially here, the people of Voliot, you have in your blood the power of regeneration, of new Hellenism, from the teachings of Anthimos Gazis. You have the vision and the fertile momentum of Regas Feraios from Velestino. You have the tradition of Magnesia in industry, in trade. But you also have the mythical "Argo", which will always symbolize the difficult journeys, but which know how to reach their destination.So from here, from Volos, we too set sail for a new exciting journey to the elections of May 21, with the air of victory, with our flags flying high, with our eyes on our hearts, for a Greece that moves forward as we want, as it deserves, steadily, boldly and always, always only forward, only upwards.Good race, for the great victory of New Democracy, of our party, for the great victory of Greece. I thank you from the bottom of my heart and with victory.
