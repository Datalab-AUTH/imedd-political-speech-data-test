We cannot have patients suffering in corridors, waiting five, six, eight months for operations. From Recovery Fund resources we will upgrade emergency departments in 80 hospitals and completely upgrade 156 health centres and recruit 10 over four years.000 nurses and doctors, to solve once and for all the issues of the gaps we have in the National Health System.I want to reduce the waiting times for surgery, the waiting times for appointments, the waiting times for emergency rooms, but at the same time we need to upgrade primary care. The Personal Doctor has already begun to take root as an institution, preventive examinations - a concept completely unknown in our country - are a key component of our health plan.For the women who are with us - I often talk about this issue, because I really want to demonstrate with an example how important it is - I want to tell you that 1,300,000 thousand women between 50 and 69 years of age have the opportunity to have a free mammogram, either in a public or a private health centre.130.000 have already made use of this free state provision. We have identified more than 7,000 women with early breast cancer that they did not know they had. They detected it through screening tests organised by the state itself and now have a very good prognosis for their health. Because it is much better and much cheaper for the National Health System to prevent diseases early than to run to hospitals to treat them late.
