We talk a lot about the imported price crisis. You see that things are gradually getting better in inflation as well. But when I am asked about inflation I say: look, inflation will come down at some point, but the wage increases and the tax cuts are permanent, they are here to stay, and so are the 300,000 jobs we have created. Just as permanent is the increase in the minimum wage from 650 to 780 euros; perhaps many of you do not remember, our commitment was to reach 730 euros. We went beyond that and went to EUR 780, because that is how we had to support the income of low-paid workers in the face of imported precision.
