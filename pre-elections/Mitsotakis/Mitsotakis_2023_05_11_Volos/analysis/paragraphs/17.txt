For our health workers who are with us, I know very well the fight they put up and the NHS held up during the pandemic. Yes, we doubled the number of intensive care units. Mind you, today we have 107,000 employees in the National Health Service, we had 100,000 when we came into things. Today we are spending 5.2 billion on the NHS, SYRIZA was spending 3.9 billion. But I know very well that we still have staff shortages. Yes, there are cots, there are long delays, in operations, to get an appointment. These are things that we need to fix.
