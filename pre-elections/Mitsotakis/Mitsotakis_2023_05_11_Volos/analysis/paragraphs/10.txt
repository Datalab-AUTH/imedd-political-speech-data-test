Allies of our great party, just as a developed economy cannot progress without cohesion in society - we have proved this in practice - so prosperity cannot come about without freedom and national sovereignty. That is why, in the same period, in this four-year period, the country has gone from being a centre for passing immigrants to a homeland with borders on land, air and sea; and after years of strengthening our Armed Forces. Active diplomacy has upgraded Greece's international standing. Tomorrow I will have the opportunity to leave here from Magnesia and go to the islands of the north-eastern Aegean, to visit Lesvos and there to see for myself that the refugee problem is now definitely a thing of the past. We have practically zeroed the flow of illegal immigrants; we have relieved our islands, we have abolished the "fortress" of Moria. It no longer exists; it is being replaced by a modern structure. National and European borders are guarded. We have succeeded at European level, for the first time, in getting the European Union to recognise that the focus of European immigration policy must be on guarding the external borders. And as much as this may upset some people, I will remind them: the Evros fence extends across the entire border.
