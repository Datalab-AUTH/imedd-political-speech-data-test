Young Democrats of Volos, colleagues from Magnesia and Thessaly, Onnedites and Onnedites, Dapites and Dapites, Mr.Regional Governor, Mr.Mayor, friends, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this impressive reception. You are raising high the flags of victory, the great victory that is coming on May 21, next Sunday; and many congratulations to our GOP for once again winning the student elections. And I am happy because I see here in Volos all generations of the party. The veterans of the party, the old colleagues, with whom we fought hard and were close to the party in good times and in difficult times.But I also see next to us many new faces, who are joining the great blue wave that is spreading today throughout the country and which will bring in exactly 10 days from now the great victory, the second governmental term of the New Democracy.
