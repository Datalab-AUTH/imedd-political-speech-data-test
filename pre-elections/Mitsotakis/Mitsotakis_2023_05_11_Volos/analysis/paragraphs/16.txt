For a country that is becoming, look, a transit centre for products, for energy.Our ports, let alone ports that have such a strategic position as the port of Volos, have in our minds a huge strategic importance for development.And on the other hand, I would like to talk a little about our government's work in critical areas of the welfare state such as education, health and the public sector, areas which are called upon to become priority axes for the second four-year term.Because I believe that we have had a number of successes over the past four years. But we have also had weaknesses. The economy has done well, there have been tax cuts, there have been tax increases. But I know very well, I have no illusions, in our country wages are still low and are being gnawed away by imported precision.
