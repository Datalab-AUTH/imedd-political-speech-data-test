When - note, there is a value to this - Mr Tsipras was asked yesterday in the debate, "What are you going to do with the F-35?", he did not answer. As he chewed his cud, what will he do about the contract to build three new Belharra frigates, the first of which will be delivered in 2025. And we will soon have new corvettes and new armoured vessels, alongside our reborn shipbuilding industry, our reborn defence industry. Look, for us, for the party of Constantine Karamanlis, national defense is the ultimate end in itself.And to come a little closer here again to your parts, soon the Marines of the 32nd Brigade, which is based here, will also acquire new amphibious vehicles. Yes, we are well aware that the men and women in uniform who wear the national emblem remain our great strength, and that is why the state is making sure to support them as much as it can by improving their pay and benefits.
