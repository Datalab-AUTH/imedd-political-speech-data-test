In 2019, when I first asked you to trust me, to trust us to govern the country, I stood up to you and promised you some very specific things. Lower taxes and more investment and jobs, income support and protection for the most vulnerable, a state that is friendly and digital at home, but reliable and proud abroad, with tidy finances, where benefits will always go hand in hand with the strengths of the economy, without the immigration scourge and with an armoured defence.That is what I committed to, friends, four years ago. And I ask you: have we delivered on all our election commitments? The answer is yes. We said and did them, despite great difficulties.
