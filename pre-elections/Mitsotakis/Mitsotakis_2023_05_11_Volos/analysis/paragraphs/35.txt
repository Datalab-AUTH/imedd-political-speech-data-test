You must have seen it yesterday for those of you who watched the debate. They've been calling for a debate for so long, and the debate happened. To show what? That only New Democracy has a coherent proposal for the next day.Mr Tsipras admitted implicitly but clearly that he is planning new taxes, Mr Androulakis wants to cut benefits. They all spoke in words and not in numbers at all. The journalists asked them other questions, and they answered other questions, which is why there was silence when I asked for our programmes to be costed by a third independent body, either the General Accounting Office of the State, the Bank of Greece or the Fiscal Council.
