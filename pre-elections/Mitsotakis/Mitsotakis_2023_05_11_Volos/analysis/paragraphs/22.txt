I remember Mr Tsipras telling us that he went to Brussels, remember, after the parody referendum and negotiated, he said, for 17 hours. And what did he bring us back? A third memorandum, which crushed the pensioners, crushed the middle class with additional taxes and cost us 100 billion.And I went to Brussels in July 2020, and I negotiated hard, not 17 hours, but 5 days. And what did I bring back? 31 billion euros for our country, through the Recovery Fund. Money, mind you, which not only has a developmental, but also a social footprint, because the social Greece of the next four years has two central priorities: health and education.
