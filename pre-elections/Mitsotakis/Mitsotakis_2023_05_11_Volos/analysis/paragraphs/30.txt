Friends, people of Voliot, I have spoken briefly about our programme, insisting that I prefer to compare with our opponents rather than to clash. Yes, to compare what they and we have done in two different but consecutive four-year terms: 29 of their taxes, 17 pension cuts, against our 50 tax cuts, pension increases, pay increases.But let us remember that SYRIZA must also be judged for its stance in opposition. For those of us who have been in parliament during this four-year period, we remember very well that Syriza said "no" to everything and "yes" to nothing. No to the defence budget, no to tax cuts and new increases, no even to the rights of people with disabilities.
