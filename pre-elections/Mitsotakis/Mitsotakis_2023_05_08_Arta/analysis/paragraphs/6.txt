The backs of citizens have today been relieved of a burden of 7 billion. Fifty taxes and contributions have been reduced. Citizens are paying lower ENVIA, even lower than they had estimated. The tax-free rate was increased, the first rate went from 22% to 9%. The solidarity levy has been abolished. In fact, the parental benefit tax was abolished as well. And you know very well how important it is now that a parent passes on property to his or her children free of charge.
