So all of this is a fact. It is data that freed the country from the surveillance that we were put under in 2018. They allowed us to repay the loans to the IMF two years earlier than we had planned and today we are half a step away from investment grade. I often talk about investment grade. Will you tell me what concerns you here in Arta and in Epirus? Is it some technical figure that only concerns bankers and economists?  I say to you 'no'. It is not an abstract concept. It is a practical necessity for cheaper money. The moment we get investment grade, everyone's borrowing rates will fall, government, business and households. That's why the investment grade is so important.
