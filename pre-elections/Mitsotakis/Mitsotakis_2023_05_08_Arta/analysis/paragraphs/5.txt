But we have also been consistent with our national obligations. We have protected our borders, which are also European borders. We have activated our diplomacy. We have strengthened our defence.But that is not all. At the same time, we have not wavered for a moment from the commitments we made when you put your trust in us in July 2019. You all remember the clear objectives we set then: lower taxes and more investment and new jobs; income support with a particular focus on the primary sector and our farmers. A more friendly and digital state, a strong Armed Forces and a country with prestige and a voice on the international stage.So I ask you, after four years, what has been the result of this effort? I think the answer can only be one: yes, with your help we have put into practice what we said.
