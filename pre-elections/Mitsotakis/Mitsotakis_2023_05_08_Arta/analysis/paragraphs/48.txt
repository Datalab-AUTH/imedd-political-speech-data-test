Look, I'll tell you as clearly as I can. In a fragile international environment, with an unpredictable neighbor next to us who may continue to be unpredictable after the elections - see what is happening in Turkey today - Greece wants a clear horizon in its course and it wants a clear solution in its leadership. It needs neither experiments nor adventurous conciliations that lead to shipwrecks.
