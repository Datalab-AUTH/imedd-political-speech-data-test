And we will continue. Yes, we will extend the fence on the Evros, as I said, with European or national funds. And let those who corrupted the country by going to Brussels and asking the European Commission not to fund the fence, putting their own personal obsessions above the national interests of the country, finally apologise. Shame on them.And of course, we will continue - always with an emphasis on budgetary discipline - with our arms programmes. I will talk about two big ones: our new corvettes, which will be built here in Greece, and the F-35, the most modern aircraft in the world today, which will join the Air Force in 2027.
