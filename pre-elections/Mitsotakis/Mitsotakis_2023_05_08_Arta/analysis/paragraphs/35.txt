A reference to fair Greece. And fair Greece in my mind, apart from speeding up justice, is mainly addressed to the weakest. The minimum guaranteed income is increased by 8%. The "Personal Assistant" for 2,000 people with disabilities is extended throughout our country; our state becomes more helpful. And on that I will not back down, not at all. Everyone is evaluated, the good are rewarded and the weak are cured.
