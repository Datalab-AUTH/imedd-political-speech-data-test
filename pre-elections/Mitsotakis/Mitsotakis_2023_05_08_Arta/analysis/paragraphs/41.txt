Today he is doing something even more unacceptable: he is even winking at the followers of Kasidiaris, refusing to resist the return of fascism through straw men.I want to dwell a little here. We made a decision, a difficult one. We passed a law, we corrected the law that we had voted for and finally our strategy was vindicated. We kept the fascists and murderers of Golden Dawn out of the Parliament, from being able to run for election. Syriza abstained. It also abstained from this obligation - especially on this issue - to build a united national front. So, unfortunately, it is a national democratic exception, it is a party sunk in the mire, it is sunk in the black colours of a non-existent world that it advertises.
