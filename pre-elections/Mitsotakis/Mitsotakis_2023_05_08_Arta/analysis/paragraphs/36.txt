I believe very much, my dear Alekos, in protecting the environment. You know very well, after all, how important this concept of sustainable development, of caring for the environment, the "Apatity Mountains", is here in Epirus. Yes, there will be no wind turbines from certain heights and above. We will protect our high mountains; we need wind turbines elsewhere, just as we need photovoltaics. We can get to 80% solar and wind power generation by 2027. But we know where to put them. We know how to protect our forests, especially many of the important forests on the continent. The reforestation programme, the waste management plants, the outstanding issues we still have with the sewage treatment centres, the biological treatment plants. These are all outstanding issues that will be closed in the next four years.
