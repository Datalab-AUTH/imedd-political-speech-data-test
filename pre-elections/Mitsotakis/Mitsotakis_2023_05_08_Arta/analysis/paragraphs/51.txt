Citizens choose, judge and compare. And they are now finding that progress is ultimately the colour blue, but it also has another colour: the colour of truth and results. That is what citizens are ultimately interested in. And this is what our government expressed, which was able to unite citizens who did not necessarily belong to our traditional hard ideological core in this great current of responsible patriotism and creative modernization.In 2019, we laid a foundation for the great majority wave that built the first floors of the Greece we want. That wave is rising again. And we must build to complete our house, our common house, the Greece we envision, with you, with the executives of New Democracy and thousands of fellow citizens around us who, without political blinders, are asking today for a better today for themselves, but above all for a better tomorrow for our children.The key to opening this road of hope is the vote on May 21. I invite you to make the message so strong that it will cover the whole of Greece.The victory will crown Arta and Epirus and from here it will spread throughout the territory. Fly the flags high. Our hearts open, Greece moving forward as it should, steadily, boldly, forward.Be well, let us go for the great victory, from here, from Arta, from Epirus, with all of Greece blue. Be well.
