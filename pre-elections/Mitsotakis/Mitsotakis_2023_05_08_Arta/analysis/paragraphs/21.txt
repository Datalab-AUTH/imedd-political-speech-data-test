I went and visited a little while ago the Consolationist, this amazing, truly amazing church. The studies are ready, but a significant intervention will be needed in order to preserve and enhance this unique monument in the country, I stress, the restoration of the Town Hall, many things that can and should be done here in Arta, in cooperation with the local government. At the same time, however, with initiatives with nationwide application and local influence.
