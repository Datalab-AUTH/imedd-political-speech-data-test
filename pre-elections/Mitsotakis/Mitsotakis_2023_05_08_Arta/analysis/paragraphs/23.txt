Take an example: health. The National Health System stood upright during the coronavirus years. Major interventions were made. A big "thank you" to our health workers, doctors, nurses, administrative, support and paramedical staff; we doubled the Intensive Care Units in less than two years. In Epirus alone we added almost 1,000 health professionals. We have made interventions, we have strengthened our hospitals and with the support of the Region. We are renovating health centres and have increased salaries by 10% in the National Health System. That is where we started the increases for civil servants.But let us face the truth. Health has been a major patient in the country for decades, just as the front of education is also an open front, where major changes have been made.
