It will be the completion of a cycle of progress which has gone through, I would say, forty waves. The President of the Parliament, the colleagues who served our parliamentary majority know well how many difficulties we have had to deal with in this four-year period, from the migratory invasions in Evros at the beginning of 2020, more than two years of pandemic, an unprecedented energy crisis from the war in Ukraine, a global "storm" of precision that is still ongoing and, at the same time, the constant challenges of Turkey in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean.And yet, in the face of all these separate difficulties - any one of them, not four combined, would be enough to break a government - we have raised mounds and kept society standing and united.
