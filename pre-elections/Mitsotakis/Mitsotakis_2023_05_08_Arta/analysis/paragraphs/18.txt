The footprint must continue here in your country, in Epirus. I was looking at the figures just before I came, we have an explosion of investment projects in all sectors, with many more jobs.Your exports alone have approached 500 million - the lion's share of course in the region's sought-after foodstuffs - but also with a growth dynamic in sectors such as high technology. Who would have thought that in Ioannina we would have a concentration of high-tech companies.
