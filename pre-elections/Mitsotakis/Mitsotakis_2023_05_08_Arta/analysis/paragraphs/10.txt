"Sweep it all", we'll sweep it all. And of course, since we are talking about the continuation of the work that we have already started, let us send a message from here, from Arta, from Epirus, a message that can be heard on the edge of our homeland, in Evros. From Alexandroupoli to Ormenio, but also to Brussels: the Evros fence will be extended and will cover the entire length of our country's land border. And let those who think that our country may be vulnerable hear the message well. The answer that we have given - I want to stress this - in record time and overcoming many difficulties, with a series of important transnational agreements, the answer has a number and a name: 24 new Rafal fighters, 84 upgraded F-16s, new helicopters, new frigates already being built. The first will be delivered before the end of 2025. New armour.
