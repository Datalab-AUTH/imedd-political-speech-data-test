For the young guys who are with us, I know how stressful it is to get a house. And how they are squeezed - the problem here is perhaps not so acute - in the big cities by very expensive rents.The "My House" programme has made a big impact and has been very well received. Why? Because quite simply a young couple can find an apartment, buy it with a loan and pay a much lower instalment than they would pay for a similar house if they wanted to rent it. Except that the house will eventually stay with them. Twenty thousand young people - I am doubling the resources available for the programme - will be able to make use of this programme. And of course we have many other initiatives.I want to generally release the real estate of the State, that it should go to the local government, whether we are talking about camps, whether we are talking about other places, whether we are talking about social rent. What is this? The state comes in and gives a developer a plot of land that is inactive. They say to him, "build some apartments here, you keep half of them, but we will keep the other half so that we can give them at low rent to those who really need them." That is the kind of policy you can expect from us in the second four years.
