And I pledge today from Arta that with the stable government of the New Democracy that will emerge after the elections, the investment grade will also happen. We will have it before the end of 2023, with one condition: a strong government of New Democracy, a great victory for New Democracy in the upcoming elections, because this national path forward can and must continue.
