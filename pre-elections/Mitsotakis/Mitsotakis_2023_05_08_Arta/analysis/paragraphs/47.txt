But we have before us a ballot box with simple proportional representation. And in that ballot box these desperate attitudes can be very dangerous. All the more so when the landscape is also blurred by discussions about certain partnerships where, however, one partner does not accept the other. All the people here will vote for Prime Minister Mitsotakis or Prime Minister Tsipras and someone comes along and says "don't worry, I know who the Prime Minister will be, it's an unknown X, he will be chosen by the third party, the loser of the ballot box". In a word, a mill.
