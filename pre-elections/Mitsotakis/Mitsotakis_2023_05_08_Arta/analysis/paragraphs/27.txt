The foundation on which we will build the Greece of the future is a productive Greece. It is the Greece that can eventually deliver better wages for all and for all. I know very well that wages in our country are still low. Let us have no illusions. We are still carrying the burden of a decade-long crisis.My first priority, just as I stood before you in 2019 and told you that I would cut taxes and contributions, so I stand before you today and tell you: wages in the private and public sector will be increased by 25%. The average salary will be able to go up to 1,500 euros. The minimum wage can go to EUR 950.
