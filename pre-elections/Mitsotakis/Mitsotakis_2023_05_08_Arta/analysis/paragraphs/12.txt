And since I have talked about the Armed Forces, let us never forget our uniformed personnel. Those who proudly wear the national emblem on their chests. We are grateful to them, but we also support them; because, yes, contrary to what others may say, for us defence is an end in itself. The ultimate end in itself is the defence of national sovereignty.This party, that of Constantine Karamanlis, was the party that always made the big choices and always placed itself on the right side of history. We have the same duty to do so now.
