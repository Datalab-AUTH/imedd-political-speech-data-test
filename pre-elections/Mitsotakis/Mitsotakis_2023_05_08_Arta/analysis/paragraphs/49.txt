That is why the ballot on 21 May is so decisive. It will prevent both ungovernability and permanent paralysis. And it will give the country a clear compass for the future. I will say it again, almost simultaneously with our elections there are elections in Turkey. The result of our ballot box will also be a message to the other side of the Aegean. This result must be one of stability and seriousness. It should also be proof that the Greeks want a strong and experienced hand at the helm of their country. As has been the case for four years now, the national boat should be able to weather the storm and always find calm waters.The dilemma, therefore, which will be posed 13 days from now is very clear: do we go forward or do we turn back? Do we want tangible results or do we want a return to lies? Do we want better wages and salaries or do we want taxes and cuts again? Do we want borders secure or open to every threat?In short, do we choose a New Democracy government and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis or a Syriza government and Prime Minister Tsipras? We weigh, decide and vote.Against the chaos of the rest of the political scene, the only meaningful proposal for governance is ours. On 21 May, Greeks will finally choose who they prefer for Prime Minister and which party they prefer for government. And the stronger the strength of the former and the greater the distance from the latter, the easier the road to a more optimistic next day will then be.
