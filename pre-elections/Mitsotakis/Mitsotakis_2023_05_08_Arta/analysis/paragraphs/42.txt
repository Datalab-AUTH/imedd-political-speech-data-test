I will say again, if you see the SYRIZA advertisements again, you will say "well, is this really the Greece of today, is this really the Greece we are experiencing today?" A party that has rediscovered a money tree, with which it easily cuts false promises that exceed 80 billion. But it does not tell us whether these will be printed cards of no value, 'Executioners', like the ones that its candidate partner, Mr Varoufakis, is planning again.We all grew up playing Monopoly. It reminds me of those coupons, the fake ones. Money in place of the citizens' real euros. A patchwork of supposed measures that can only lead to two possibilities: either a new tax raid or a new memorandum and a new European supervision.
