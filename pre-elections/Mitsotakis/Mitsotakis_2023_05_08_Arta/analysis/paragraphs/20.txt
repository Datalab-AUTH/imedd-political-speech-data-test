I will not repeat them today, we had discussed them in detail when we were in Epirus, the important irrigation projects: the dam in Kompoti, the large land reclamation projects in the plain of Arta, the extension of natural gas in Ioannina, in Preveza, in Igoumenitsa, the industrial park, which we discussed again with the Regional Governor.Important projects, Mayor, which must be carried out here in your city, the restoration of Imaret, the proper utilisation - and we are always ready here to discuss all possible options - of the "Xenia" in Arta, the important interventions - this site must be utilised, it is unique. I am here to help, I tell you to listen.
