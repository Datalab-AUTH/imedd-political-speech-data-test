I am following with great interest this debate that is taking place in the opposition, among the co-owners of the centre-left block of flats: "Who owns Andrew?". He belongs to PASOK, he belongs to SYRIZA, he belongs to both.I have one thing to say to you: he certainly does not belong to New Democracy, and we are not interested in appropriating the legacy of Andreas Papandreou, just as we are not interested in returning to 1981. We are interested in talking about 2023. Let us, Mr President, you who love history as much as I do, let us leave history to the historians. Let us talk about Greece in 2023 and let us leave Mr Tsipras to go to Lamia today and speak in front of the statue of Aris Velouchiotis. We will not take Greece back to false divisions that do not concern today's society. And they certainly do not concern the young people who are with us today.
