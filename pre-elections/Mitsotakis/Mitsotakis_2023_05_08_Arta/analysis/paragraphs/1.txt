Young Democrats of Arta, citizens from every corner of our beautiful Epiros, which I love so much and visit on every occasion, Mr. Regional Governor, Mr. Mayor, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm, this overwhelming welcome. Thank you for your impressive presence. You give me courage and strength in the great struggle that we are fighting.Less than two weeks - 13 days, in fact - separate us from May 21. From the Sunday when we will close the road to a second time to disaster. With our vote we will give a second strong mandate for progress, for a country that walks proudly, firmly, boldly and only forwards. I understand when the elections are approaching when my voice starts to turn off, but that will not prevent us from continuing to turn Greece around, to present our programme, to claim the vote of the citizens for a great victory on May 21.And I would say that especially here in Arta, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Regional Governor, the decision of the people of Arta has a double meaning. I remember that in the 2019 elections we lost the primary, here in Arta, by a few hundred votes. The message you will send here will be heard throughout Greece, we will be first and by far in Arta.
