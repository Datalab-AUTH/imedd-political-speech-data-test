Friends, I talk as much as possible about my plan for the future, not the past, and I certainly don't dwell too much on what the opposition says. I always, wherever I go, make sure that I have our paper with me with our plan for the next four years. We don't hide it, we show it, we advertise it. We are not ashamed of it; it is costed, it is thought out. It is EUR 9 billion of measures over a four-year horizon. It is all set in specific timetables. We are talking about a Greece that is productive, social, fair, digital, green - and I always emphasise this: environmentally green because it will be blue in terms of the colour of the electoral map - and strong.In 2019, we signed a truth agreement together. I kept it. Now we will renew this Truth Contract, because I can commit myself today to doing what I am talking to you about, precisely because, despite the difficulties, I have done what I committed to in 2019.
