In the public sector, already now - because we like to prepare for the next day - we have already budgeted 500 million additional expenditure for the special payroll. Yesterday I specified the increases in family allowances, because we want to support families with children. The family allowance for a family of civil servants with two children will go from EUR 70 to EUR 120. And with three children, from 120 to 170. And for those with four, from 170 to 220.And annual pensions will continue to rise, I estimate at around 4%. As will the tax cuts. Targeted employer contributions will be reduced, in the first instance by another point. The tax-free allowance is increased by an additional EUR 1,000 for each child. We want to support families with children.
