But in this area too, much remains to be done. Look at our state, the state is a bit like "Janus". It's a bit two-faced. On the one hand, we have gov.gr, a revolution that I pledged to make happen and, yes, we have made it happen. One billion electronic transactions. No more waiting in queues for meaningless transactions with the Greek state. We have made huge strides in Civil Protection. "112" exists, it works, it saves lives. I was reading a report that in the United Kingdom - the United Kingdom, a serious country, G7 - they are now starting to experiment with '112'. We have put it into practice within six months of being elected; this state, which we often and rightly criticise, has organised - let me remind you - an exemplary vaccination campaign. And it has finally built an EFKA that pays out pensions on time, not after two years, but after two months.But the work is not finished. We still have many sad instances of delays, irresponsibility, "ochodermicism". They often lead to tragedies such as the one we have recently experienced.We have a duty and I am even more determined in my second four years to eliminate the bad aspects of public administration. Let the good face of the public service become the norm. That is why overcoming these gaps, the shortcomings that have been identified, are becoming the specific objectives of the new government's mandate.
