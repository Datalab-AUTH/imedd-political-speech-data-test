And all this alongside our revitalised shipbuilding and defence industry. Yesterday I had a very interesting event on the economy and I went and spoke at the Elefsina shipyards. It is really very moving when we see workers who for many years have considered their jobs precarious, working full-time, with good wages, with a smile on their faces, with five ships that are currently in the Elefsina shipyards for repairs and many more, hundreds of jobs, about to be launched next year. So I understand the importance of investment, the importance of creating new jobs everywhere, all over the country.
