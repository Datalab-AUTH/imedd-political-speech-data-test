For education, 4,000 additional teacher recruitments this year, to add to the 25,000. As I said, digital interactive whiteboards everywhere. Many more experimental and model schools. We've doubled them, we want to take a similar step again.I'm pleased every time I see how responsive local communities are to the Model and Experimental schools we're creating. You know, for us, excellence is not a respectable thing. And we want universities with libraries, not sledgehammers.We want kids to know that if they work hard they can get ahead, get into a good university. We have solved the issues of the professional rights of the Faculty of Agriculture here in Arta, and we have other outstanding issues with professional rights that we need to solve in the next four years.We have a lot of young people here. I know how difficult the housing issue is, especially when you have to move from one city to another. We have increased by 50% the rent allowance for our students. We doubled it in cases where children want to live together. And we will build 8,500 new dormitories for 8,500 students in five different cities across the country.
