In this election, therefore, there is no room for frivolity. Every mistake means danger, a mortal danger for our achievements so far. It means a brake on our future claims. It is also a mistake that cannot be corrected later; there are no "cutters". We all pay the consequences; every uncontested vote or invalid so-called protest ultimately leads only to national weakness. The solution is different, you know it, and it is one: a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy.We have lived it, we have lived it in 2019, we have lived it since 2016, when you entrusted me with the great responsibility of leading our party. Many of the old divisions have faded; together we have lived through four years of endless trials. Then a four-year period that turned difficulties into opportunities and turned them into successes. So we can compare and judge: four years of Tsipras and Syriza, four years of Mitsotakis and New Democracy.
