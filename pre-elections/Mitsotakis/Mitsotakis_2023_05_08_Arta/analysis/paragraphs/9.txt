But, friends, there is no economy without freedom. And obviously there is no social prosperity without national sovereignty. I am particularly proud that in the midst of great difficulties, in the space of four years, Greece has gone from being a "scattered place" to a homeland with borders on land, air and sea; that it has almost zeroed the flow of migrants; that it has relieved our border islands - which I will be visiting later this week. We are talking about a completely different picture in Lesvos, in Chios, in Samos, in Kos. In place of the unacceptable structures - the Moria warehouses - we have established humane accommodation facilities.
