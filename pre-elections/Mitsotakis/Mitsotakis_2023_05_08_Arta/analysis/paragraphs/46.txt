So what can I say, in its agony, SYRIZA even took on the Supreme Court, which does not approve formations that do not meet the requirements to run in the elections. But then he says, it's all his fault because of the polls. Now it's the polls' fault. I heard today "don't believe them", he says, "because 5 out of 7 don't answer because they are afraid of having their phones tapped".I say: I don't need to do any polls, come here in Arta, in Tsipras' home town, you did the best poll. Come and compare how many people we had and how many people Mr Tsipras had when he came and spoke here. This is the live poll of Arta and Epirus to which I attach much more importance.
