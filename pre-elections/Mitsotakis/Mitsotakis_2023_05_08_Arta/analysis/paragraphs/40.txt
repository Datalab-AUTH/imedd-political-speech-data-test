I would like to say a few words, as we approach the elections - and the dilemmas are now crystallising - about what we see before us. Facing this coherent proposal that I have talked to you about and that I want to talk about between now and the elections, we have an opposition, a Syriza, that has certainly shown us what it can do as a government. It has saddled us with an unnecessary memorandum. They come along and have the audacity to say, look, we, he says, bankrupted the country in 2015; when they led us to the brink. They had a referendum. They did the infamous "fucking coup". They agreed to a third memorandum. If it wasn't for New Democracy holding the country up and standing back, putting the country's interests above party interests, I don't know where we would be today.They came next, put 29 taxes on you, cut pensions 17 times, turned the country into a center for transient immigrants and exiled it to the international fringe. That's what Syriza did as a government, that's its work.What did it do as an opposition? We who were in Parliament remember them. And sometimes, indeed, we were surprised by his attitude: "no" to tax cuts. "No" to increases. 'No' to armaments. 'No' to defence agreements. 'No' to the fence. "No" even to the rights of our fellow citizens with disabilities.
