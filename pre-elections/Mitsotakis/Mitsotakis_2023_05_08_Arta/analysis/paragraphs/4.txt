We spent more than â‚¬55 billion on the coronavirus and on the energy crisis. We have supported workers, we have supported businesses, we have supported jobs. This morning I visited, among other places, Parga, which was booming and bubbling with life. And I was thinking that all those shops that are now operating on the beach and ready to welcome the tourists of this tourist season would not be operating today if it were not for the support we gave to all the small and medium-sized enterprises and workers during the difficult years of the coronavirus.
