Friends and friends, against those who choose through their advertisements to present a Greece that is grey and black as black. Since I am speaking in a rural area, you may have seen a SYRIZA commercial with a poor guy, an actor, not a real farmer, who has a truck with artichokes. They even painted the artichokes black to show a supposed blackness, which doesn't exist. Because wherever I go, despite the difficulties, I see one thing: Greece of 2023 is nothing like Greece of 2019. It certainly doesn't resemble the Greece of 2015, the closed banks, the bank closures, the fixation, the pension cuts.
