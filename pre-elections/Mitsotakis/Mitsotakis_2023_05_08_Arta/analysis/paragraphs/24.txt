We were the ones who came in and for the first time made permanent appointments of teachers, 25,000 substitutes who went from city to city, from island to island, without any job stability, finally have a permanent position and can serve education with the stability that the very profession of a teacher requires.We increased the number of Standard and Experimental schools, and we have already started a program of enormous importance. It is financed, mind you, by the Recovery Fund. You often hear about the Recovery Fund and you say, "Now what is this money? Is it really about us?" Within the next year, we will have 36,000 interactive teaching boards in every public school classroom from Grade 5 to Grade 3.
