Great emphasis on policing. Policing everywhere. Watch now how the digital state comes in and helps policing: if we have more digital processes and we don't need police officers in the police stations dealing with bureaucratic matters, these police officers can go out on the streets, in the neighbourhoods, in the countryside, where they need to be. Five thousand police officers in total will be released from such duties so that they can be deployed where they are really very useful: in the security of the citizen.
