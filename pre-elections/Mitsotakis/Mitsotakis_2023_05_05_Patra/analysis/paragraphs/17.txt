Fellow competitors, members of our great party, nothing in Greece of 2023 resembles the image of Greece of 2019. Not only in the field of taxes, wages and labour, but also in other critical areas, security, national defence and foreign policy. The "scorpion country" in which some people did not distinguish borders at sea and wanted them wide open on land no longer exists. It belongs to another era.
