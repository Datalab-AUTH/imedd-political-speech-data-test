And when the country is proud of its major projects, when Athens is proud of the Metro, when Thessaloniki is proud of its own project that is being completed, when the north is proud of the Egnatia axes, when the whole country is proud of irrigation projects, when you are proud of the 14 regional airports, you have every reason to be proud.I told you in 2019 that I would move heaven and earth - I used those exact words - to finally put into practice the great development issue for Ilia and Achaia, the Patras-Pyrgos road. Well, the road is being built, it is being built, it is no longer a model, it is no longer a project in the minds of some people. It was a personal bet of mine.Today I visited the construction site near Patras. I was pleased because there are parts of the road that are progressing faster than the planned timetable we had set. The road will be ready in early 2025. Together with your support, I will be the Prime Minister who will officially inaugurate it.
