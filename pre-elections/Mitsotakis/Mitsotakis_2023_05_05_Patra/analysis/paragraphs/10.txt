So let's go back to what I had four years ago and what we did. We eliminated fifty taxes. We cut taxes. I told you that I was going to reduce the ENVIA. How much? 30%. And I reduced it how much? 35%. For all owners. Import tax rate. Where did we get it? At 22%. Where is it today? At 9%.No one, except the very rich, pays parental benefit tax anymore. You can freely pass on property to your children and grandchildren. No one pays solidarity tax, and contributions have been reduced by four points.
