On our Evros, the fence is being extended and illegal migrant flows have almost been reduced to zero. Our islands have been relieved of the disgrace of Moria. In the Aegean, our Coast Guard saves lives every day from the networks of traffickers. And in our cities, including Patras, we don't have - as we once did - migrants being "basking" and then disappearing.
