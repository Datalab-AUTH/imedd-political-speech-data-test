Let us now talk a little bit about education. In addition to interactive whiteboards, we will exceed 150 Model Schools. Do you remember how much Standard and Experimental were fought by some people? Now they recognize their great value and we are faced with the happy situation of having many more applications than we can accommodate; full-day primary schools everywhere, with hours until the afternoon to relieve working mothers. Upgrading vocational education, better salaries for teachers, better housing for students. We will build 8,500 places in student halls of residence.
