When I spoke again here, in Patras, four years ago, let us remember together what I had committed to. Less taxes and more investment and new jobs. I made a commitment to you for a country with impregnable borders, with dynamic growth, with better incomes. A country that would take care of the most vulnerable, but also a country that would get off the sidelines and elevate its place in the diplomatic arena.
