The steps taken in education. We still have a lot to do. I will talk to you about them later. But, yes, we were the ones who first appointed 25,000 permanent teachers to our schools. And it's a great joy for me when I go and meet substitutes who have become permanent and they say, "Finally, you've relieved us of that stress of having to move from city to city not knowing if we're going to have a stable job next year." Thousands of such hires have been made here in your own District.
