Young Democrats of Patras, allies from Achaia, from all over Western Greece, thank you for this impressive welcome. I will again be the Prime Minister with your strong mandate on 21 May.A big hand for our amazing youth, the ONNEDites. And good luck in the student elections. Again the GOP will be in the lead, because it always shows the way forward, the way of progress, progress, prosperity.
