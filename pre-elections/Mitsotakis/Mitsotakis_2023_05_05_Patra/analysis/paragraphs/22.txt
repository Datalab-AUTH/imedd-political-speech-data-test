But we go on to win the other bets we have committed to. At last, the water supply of the city and the irrigation of the Region from the Piraeus-Parapiro dam. With all the irrigation and water supply networks. The railway connection to Rio and the port with a 5.2 km underground connection within the urban fabric. The strengthening of your dynamic university. The upgrading of the port so that Patras can once again become the western gateway of the country. The redevelopment of the ski resort of Kalavryta, of Ladopoulos.And of course, I am not forgetting - because we have friends here and from Agrinio - Aitoloakarnania, Mr. Mayor, the connection of Agrinio with the Ionian Highway, the ecological upgrading of the lagoon of Messolonghi.
