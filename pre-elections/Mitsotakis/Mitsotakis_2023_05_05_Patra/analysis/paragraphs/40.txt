The second objective, my personal objective: decent public health care. I know that the National Health System was tested during the pandemic years, but it is my commitment at the end of the four years to have a different National Health System.We will upgrade, with money from the Recovery Fund, 156 health centres. We will have new emergency departments in 80 hospitals. We will put an end - and we can do it, at last - to cots and halve the time it takes to serve patients. I do not accept, in Greece in 2023, that you have to wait months and months for a scheduled operation; we will have new hospitals. At least four in number, in Komotini, in Sparta, a new paediatric and oncological hospital in Thessaloniki, remote telemedicine units. But we will have one more thing: we will expand the institution of the Personal Doctor for all and for all. Already many of you have registered, it is a successful institution. But most importantly, friends, we will close the loose ends regarding the staff. We will recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors over the next four years.I will repeat here my commitment - I said it today in Ilia, when I was in Amaliada and Pyrgos - that no health facility will be closed, all of them will be modernised, all of them will have their role. It does not matter whether it is a small hospital or a larger hospital; we will close the outstanding staffing issues. And you will know that health will finally be transformed from a major patient into a protagonist of the social policy of the New Democracy. This is my personal commitment, it is my personal bet, and you can trust me that I know how to make it happen.
