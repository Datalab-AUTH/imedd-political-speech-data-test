I am proud of our social policy. I am proud that we have dealt with a number of very difficult social issues that supposedly progressive governments of the past had left completely on the sidelines.Because New Democracy, friends, is the great popular party of social justice, which wants to give opportunities to everyone, primarily to the weakest.
