Because indeed, friends, I have said it many times and I mean it, I will say it again here in Patras: the next elections will be the most crucial elections of the post-communist era. They will decide whether we will go forward or turn back, whether we will risk new adventures of ungovernability or whether we will continue on the path of security and prosperity, as we have been going these four years, with a captain and crew on board the national ship who have shown that they can weather great storms, such as those we have gone through and overcome together.
