Greeks are united again, as they were in 2019, in a wide river. It is the wave of responsible patriotism and creative modernization that was born in 2019 and is swelling again, rallying all citizens, all those who, without party blinkers, claim a better today for themselves and certainly a better tomorrow for their children. And this great current of progress I invite you tonight to make it grow, to flood and blossom in every corner of the country, with you, the members of New Democracy, as protagonists. After all, our Secretary of the Political Committee, Pavlos Marinakis, is also from Patras, and every patriot who claims what we claim, Greece, the Greeks first in Europe, will be next to us. Carry this message everywhere, town by town, village by village, neighbourhood by neighbourhood.
