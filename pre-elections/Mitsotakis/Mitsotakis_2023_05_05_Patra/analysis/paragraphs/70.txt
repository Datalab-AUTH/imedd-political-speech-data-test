It is good to measure our boot and not our shadow, as the wise Greek people say. Above all, however, we should all be at the height that circumstances demand. I would like to ask you one thing as we approach the peak of the election period. Our country is not asking us to reopen the wounds of the civil war every now and then, nor to argue about the surrender of past leaders.
