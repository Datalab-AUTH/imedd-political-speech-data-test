Constantine and Helen will be celebrated by our democracy, with our country proudly running the road of progress at a faster speed, more productive, more social, more just. Let us fly the flags of progress. There are many of us and more of us every day. The future cannot wait. On 22 May we will bring victory to Patras, to Achaia. Walking as we have decided, steadily, boldly and always forward.We are going for victory. Long live New Democracy. Thank you very much.
