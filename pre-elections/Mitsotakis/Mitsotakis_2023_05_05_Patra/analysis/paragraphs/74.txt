So in this ballot box, and there is only one ballot box - I do not hear what will happen in the second ballot box, I can only see one ballot box in front of me, on 21 May - there is no room for uncontested votes and empty messages of so-called protest. No mistake can be corrected afterwards. On the contrary, a resounding message from this ballot box will pave the way for the perspective that the country is looking for: a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy.
