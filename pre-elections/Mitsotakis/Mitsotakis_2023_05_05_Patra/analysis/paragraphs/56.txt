I will talk a little bit, very little about the opposition, but I want to say a few things as we are already in the middle of the election period. We have a Syriza that, after failing as a government, has also failed as an opposition. It is also failing now as a 'serious force'. It is proving that it remains incorrigible, miserable like its own reality and, unfortunately, as dark as its own advertising messages.
