The first objective, non-negotiable for me and trust me that we can achieve it: we will raise wages by 25% within four years. The average wage will go to 1,500 euros and the minimum wage will go to 950 euros; we will finally have a new wage scale for the public sector and we will have additional tax reductions. We will increase the tax-free allowance by EUR 1,000 for each child.
