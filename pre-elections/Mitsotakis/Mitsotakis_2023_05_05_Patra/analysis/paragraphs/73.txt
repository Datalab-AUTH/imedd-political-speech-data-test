Precisely for all of the above, I insist that the country needs today more than ever a clear horizon on the path and a clear solution in leadership. Just as clear is the question we are called upon to answer on 21 May: are we moving forward or turning back? Do we continue with relief and better wages or do we fall back into taxes and cuts? Do we want a country that is armoured and secure or a country that is weak against every threat? With a voice proud and strong abroad or with awkward visitors to foreign leaders? In other words, all these dilemmas are finally united into one: do we want New Democracy and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis or Syriza and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras? So simple but so serious.
