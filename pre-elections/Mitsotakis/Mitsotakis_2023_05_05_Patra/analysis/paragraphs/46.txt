And of course, the new major reform of the state. It is not enough for the state to be digital, we need to change the internal processes. For the first time we had a nationwide ASEP competition. More than 70,000 gave, were tested. Those who enter the civil service will be made permanent after a two-year test, but they will all be constantly evaluated. I am not backing down one step on the need to have evaluation everywhere.At the end of the four years, this big step they have taken with gov.gr will be completed. The whole public sector will be 100% digital. But it has to be efficient. Digital transactions alone are not enough. We need professional behaviours as well.
