I go on tours, many people say to me, "President, we see what Tsipras is showing us and our hearts go out to him." That is not the reality of today. He has painted everything black.  Even the artichokes are black.But don't get your heart caught up in the false blackness. You will send them the bill and the answer at the ballot box on May 21. Because this is not the Greece of 2023. But it did the same thing when it closed the banks, when it saddled us with a third unnecessary memorandum, when it imposed 29 taxes and 17 cuts, when it crushed the pensioners with the Katrougalos law.
