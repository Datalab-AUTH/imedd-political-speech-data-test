By 2027, 80% of our electricity needs will be produced from Renewable Energy Sources. They are cheap, they are clean. No one can blackmail us and shut off our gas and hold us hostage.Of course, these programs are not just for the big producers, they are for you too. You saw the response that there was to all the conservation programs. From the "Change Water Heater" - and a water heater is a Renewable Energy Source - to the "Roof Photovoltaics", to the small photovoltaics for farmers and Energy Communities, so that the farming community can reduce their production costs.
