I took on a duty in 2019 to support our Armed Forces, because I am well aware that defending our national sovereign rights and national sovereignty is non-negotiable for our party. You can already see the results: 24 new Rafale, 84 upgraded F-16s for the Air Force, new frigates - the first two are already being built - and modern armoured vehicles. But above all, we rely on the capabilities of those who bear the national emblem and whom the country strengthens as much as it can, both morally and financially.
