We will phase out the business tax. We will reduce by at least 30% the presumption of subsistence, an unfair tax that comes from the past. We will reduce employer contributions by at least one point.You will tell me, how can we achieve this? We can achieve this because the precondition for this policy is that we have growth much higher than in Europe, more investment. And, yes, unemployment at the end of 2027 - mark my words - will be below 8%. It will finally approach the European average.
