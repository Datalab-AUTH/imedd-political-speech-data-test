Friends, Mr. Regional Governor, dear fellow candidates, we are together again after a short time. In the meantime, however, I see that the crowd has grown and the pulse has increased, so that your presence here today turns my optimism into confidence. Yes, on 21 May this spring brings a new victory, a new four-year term for a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy.So, on the occasion of this slogan, I will address all the people of Patras and Patrina, come and let us make the big bet together that this time Achaia will be blue.
