I've been hearing lately that Mr Tsipras says he cares a lot about pensioners. Yes, now he's remembered. After having smashed the pensioners with the Katrougal law, he is now coming and saying that it is the fault of the Katrougal personal difference that some people did not get a raise now and that he will abolish it in the future, he says. Which he himself did.
