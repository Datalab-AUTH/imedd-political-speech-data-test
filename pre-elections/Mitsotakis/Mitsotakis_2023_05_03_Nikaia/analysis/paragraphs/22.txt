And we will do the cash, of course, on the evening of May 21, and I am absolutely sure that on that evening we will know, regardless of the "hibernation" of the simple proportional representation, on the evening of May 21 - and regardless of what happens afterwards - we will know who will govern Greece for the next four years. And that will be New Democracy, our great party. Be well, thank you very much, good strength, good fight.
