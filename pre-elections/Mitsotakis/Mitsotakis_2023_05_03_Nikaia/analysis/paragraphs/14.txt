And that's the future we're talking about. This is the future we want to talk about in the 18 days until the elections, so that people can compare, in the end, not only what we have achieved. We will be judged on our work for four years. Syriza was judged on its own work in the last four years. Moreover, it does not seem to have changed its mind at all. The same things it said in '15 are the same things it is saying now. The same company and perhaps worse, because you see, the many companies with Mr Varoufakis have given various people ideas about how they can perceive progressive governance. Because if I understand it correctly, progressive governance as Syriza understands it, in partnership with PASOK and with Mr Varoufakis' party, simply means that someone may come along at some point and say to you: "I'm sorry, the banks have closed and your euros have become 'Executioners'".
