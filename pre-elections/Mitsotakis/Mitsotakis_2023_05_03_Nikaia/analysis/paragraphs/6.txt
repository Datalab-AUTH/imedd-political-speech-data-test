And with the same fervour, with the same enthusiasm I want to continue, friends, because we have many plans for Greece for the next four years, how to increase our wages, how to have better health care. How we will continue to shield Greece. And I think that has a special importance here in Nice, in the refugee Nice. You know very well that this government has defended the national sovereignty of the country and protected its sovereign rights. It guarded the borders. And it sent the message of a strong Greece, which will always face all crises from a position of confidence, with good and strong alliances. This is how we understand our country's role in the wider region.
