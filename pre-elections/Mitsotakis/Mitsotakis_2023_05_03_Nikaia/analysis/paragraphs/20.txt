I'm not telling you, because quite simply the basics that I had committed to do, I did. I told you that I would cut taxes, I did. I told you that I would reduce contributions, I have reduced them. I told you that I would create jobs, I have created jobs. I told you that I would raise the minimum wage, I did. I told you that I would protect the borders, I protected them. I told you that I would invest in the Armed Forces and I invested.Can others say the same?  They cannot.So, because we have to keep a firm grip on the wheel, give me the strength to lead the country more boldly, more forward, more upwards. I need that strength. I need it especially here, from Piraeus II, from Nice.
