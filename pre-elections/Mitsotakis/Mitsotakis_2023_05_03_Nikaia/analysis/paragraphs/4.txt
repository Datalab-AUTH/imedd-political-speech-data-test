What I do is for you to judge. One thing you should know is that we have given local government the most financial tools it has ever had at its disposal to implement critical projects that ultimately improve your quality of life. So we have done our duty, as we have supported social structures, we have supported health structures, we have built the Health Centre in Keratsini, which is a model Health Centre for how we perceive public health in our country in the next day. We have strengthened the policing departments, because I know that this is an issue that concerns you very much. We have, in other words, bent over backwards to the problems of your own regions.
