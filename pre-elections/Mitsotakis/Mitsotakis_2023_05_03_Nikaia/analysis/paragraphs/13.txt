I want to tell them that the Greece of 2023 is not the Greece of 2012, it is not the Greece of 2015, it is not the black Greece that is presented in the TV spots of SYRIZA. It is a country that is well on its feet. It is a country that is optimistic. It is a country that is bright. It is a country that can look to the future with greater confidence, with greater optimism, with greater self-confidence.
