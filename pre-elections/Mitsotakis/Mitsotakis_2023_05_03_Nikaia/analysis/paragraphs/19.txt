So these are some of the specific commitments we have made. And of course, in elections all parties are judged on their credibility. Do they believe us or will they believe those who have never put into practice what they promised? I believe that the people will believe us, ladies and gentlemen, simply because we have done what we said we would do, and I have not sought, mind you, any alibi. I did not hide behind judgments. I could have said to you, "I had a pandemic, I had Turkey, I had a refugee crisis, I had Ukraine, I had war, I had a lot of things, so I am sorry I was late.
