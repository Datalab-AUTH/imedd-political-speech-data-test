So we are making a commitment to pensioners that your pensions will continue to grow every year. And pensions will increase in line with the growth rate of the economy, the faster the economy grows. And for those who have fallen victim to the personal differential and have not seen increases in pensions, I want you to know that, especially for low-income pensioners, we will continue to support you until the personal differential is finally erased as pensions increase.
