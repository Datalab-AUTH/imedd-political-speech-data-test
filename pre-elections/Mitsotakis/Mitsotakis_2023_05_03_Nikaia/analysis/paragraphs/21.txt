I am sure that the results of the elections will surprise many people. All those people who have been cultivating various scenarios from now on, now they don't like, he says, the polls. I hear the latest theory of Syriza is that they don't like the polls, they don't like the polls, they don't correspond to reality because they say people don't dare to answer the pollsters, we say they don't need any polls. Come and see how many people we get at our rallies and how many people Syriza gets so that you can take the real measurement of what is happening in society.
