And this course, friends, this course of progress, this course of progress, this course of progress must under no circumstances be interrupted in the next elections. And this is the great stake that we all have to win. We have achieved a lot in these four years. We have gone through great difficulties: from the pandemic, the refugee crisis, the crisis with Turkey, the war in Ukraine, the imported boom in price. But we have kept the country firmly on the path of progress. And that is precisely what this election is all about. Whether we will keep moving forward or whether we will roll back.
