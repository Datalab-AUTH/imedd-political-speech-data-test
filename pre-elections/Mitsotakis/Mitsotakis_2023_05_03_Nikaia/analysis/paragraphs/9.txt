Friends, but because I am here in Nice, an area with very strong political symbolism, I cannot help but comment on recent developments. And I am referring specifically to the decision of the Supreme Court Chamber to ban the Golden Dawn killers from contesting the national elections.We have raised a mound of democracy. The regulation that we passed in Parliament has been tested in practice and has had the expected results. And I am proud today, as a democratic, progressive citizen, that it was the New Democracy party that took the lead and won the battle. It was a battle for democracy that we won today.
