I come, friends, from a very nice visit I made to the shipyards of Perama and I am referring specifically to our shipbuilding zone, because it marks the commitment we have given all these last four years to job creation. I have seen shipyards that are bustling with life, more than 10,000 people working in Perama, the shipyards of Elefsina have been saved by this Government from certain closure, 700 jobs have been saved, another 1,300 will be created, and that, my friends, is how we understand progressive social policy in practice. And I mention this because you know many people claim and wear the mantle of progressive, but I wonder if there is a more progressive policy than one that creates jobs with good wages and lifts people out of unemployment. And I refer specifically to this parameter, because only New Democracy has proven over time that it can bring growth, bring investment and bring more and better paid jobs.
