But I wonder, how do those who were absent from this battle that we all had to fight together feel today? SYRIZA never voted for the legislation in Parliament, on which the arguments of the Supreme Court Chamber were based. It refused to submit a memorandum to the Supreme Court, arguing the obvious, that essentially behind the party that was contesting the elections is a criminal organisation that has been convicted of using criminal violence. He was able, listen to this, because there was a last big effort to have SYRIZA file a memo together with New Democracy and together with PASOK.Think how strong our position would be if the three major parties came to court together and asserted the obvious. And yet, the supposedly progressive and left-wing Syriza chose to stand against this front of common sense and democracy that we put up. Together with Mr Varoufakis, who, Mr Varoufakis told us: "the party of Kasidiaris must not be excluded from the Parliament".
