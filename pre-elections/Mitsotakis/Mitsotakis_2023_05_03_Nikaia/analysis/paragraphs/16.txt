A Greece of social cohesion that in the next four years will put the first emphasis on public health, because I know how much you and we are concerned about this issue and I want all Greeks and all Greek women to know that everyone must have equal access to quality public health, from the preventive examinations that we are now starting for women for breast cancer, to the Personal Doctor.Think about it, for the first time the state came in and went to women from 50 to 69 years old, sent them a message and said, "you can have a free breast cancer screening." 130,000 women have already taken advantage of this program, 7,000 cases of breast cancer have been identified. These were women who didn't know they had breast cancer and now that they know, they have a much increased chance of getting well. So we envision a comprehensive public health approach, starting with screening, going to the Personal Physician-and I know many of you have already signed up and are using the Personal Physician.It will go to quality health centres, such as the one we have opened and which is already operating in Keratsini, and then we will have good, quality hospitals, where you will not be delayed to have an operation, you will not be inconvenienced in the emergency departments, you will not have to pay a fee to have an operation more quickly.This is our approach, our vision for the public health of the future, for a Greece that takes care of all, especially our weaker citizens, our older citizens, our pensioners.
