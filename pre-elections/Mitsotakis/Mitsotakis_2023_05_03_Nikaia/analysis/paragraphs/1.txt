Thank you for the very warm welcome in Nikaia, in Piraeus. From here we send the message of the great victory in the elections of 21 May. The message that the country must continue to move forward with stability and security, with prosperity and with confidence in the future. A better future, which can only be guaranteed by our great party, New Democracy.I think that all of us together today can make a bet, which I know we are in a position to win. To bring New Democracy first in Piraeus and especially first here in Nikaia.
