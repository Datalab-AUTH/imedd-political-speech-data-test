And, of course, I am happy because I am in a square here, which is also identified with the way we perceive major infrastructure projects in our country. Here, the Metro, which we had the opportunity to inaugurate, brought Nikaia out of its isolation and connected it to the centre of Athens. I would like to tell you that similar major projects are being launched throughout the country. Thessaloniki will very soon have its own ultra-modern Metro, and here in Athens the Metro will be extended further westwards, and we will have a new line connecting one end of the city with the other. Because this ultimately means growth and prosperity, many major projects that improve the daily lives of citizens. Large, medium and small, of course, because don't forget that here the municipalities in your region have received more than 100 million resources to be used.
