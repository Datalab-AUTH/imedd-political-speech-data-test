Today I visited a school in Piraeus and saw the first interactive whiteboards which are being installed in every Greek public school classroom from the 5th grade to the 3rd grade. Money from the Recovery Fund. A true revolution in education. You should see the smiles of the children and the smiles of the teachers and the teachers.In fact, a teacher came to see me at school and said: "fortunately, the New Democracy government had to come in so that I could be permanently appointed in education". We made 25,000 appointments, and all these teachers who were going from island to island, substitutes with complete job insecurity, now know that they have a stable position so that they can serve their profession.
