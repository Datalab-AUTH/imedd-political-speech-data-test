Friends, I want you to know one thing: we will win this election and we will win it by a wide margin.We have with us many old fighters who have fought many elections and who know very well that elections are decided until the last day. So I would ask you that there should be no complacency. We are doing well, we can do even better and we will do better.So let us go and give it all on Sunday night. In addition to the great victory of Olympiacos in basketball, Constantine and Helen, we will also celebrate the victory of New Democracy and the victory of our party, the victory of Greece.Be well. Thank you very much for this impressive reception. Good strength and a good race. Be well. Thank you very much.
