We have supported the defenders of labour. A friend said to me, "Tell me what you're going to do with the Katrougal personal difference". I said to him, "Send the bill for the Katrougalos law to Mr Tsipras and Mr Katrougalos.We are the ones who raised pensions for the first time, and I pledge here, from Piraeus, for those pensioners who did not see an increase because of the personal difference, we will continue to support you until the personal difference is finally erased.
