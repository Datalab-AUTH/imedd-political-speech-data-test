We are the only party which, today, has a well thought-out and costed programme and essentially, friends, let's not kid ourselves, we are the only serious proposal for the next day's governance of the country.Because here you vote for New Democracy and you know: you vote for New Democracy, you have Prime Minister Mitsotakis. On the other hand, a landscape in a fog. The country does not need uncertainty today, nor does it need instability, nor does it need experimentation and allied governments where one is always looking at how to undermine the other, instead of working for the good and prosperity of the country.
