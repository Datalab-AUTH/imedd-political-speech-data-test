You see that I have avoided saying anything about the opposition and its leader personally. A gentleman said it very nicely: 'we don't need to say anything. We know him well, we have tested him, we don't believe any of the lies he tells us".I prefer every minute of the time I have to talk about the future, to talk about our plans for a Greece that is really strong. To talk about how we are going to improve your incomes, how we are going to reduce taxes even more, how we are going to support pensioners. That's what you expect to hear from us.
