And of course, friends, I would also like to say a few words about the difficult geopolitical environment in which we find ourselves today, and why the elections that are coming up are of enormous importance not only for the economy, for health, for education, for pensions, but also of enormous importance for what will happen on the foreign policy front.I personally know very well how difficult it has been to manage Turkey over these four years. But we are the ones who kept the country strong, who invested in the Armed Forces, who built alliances from the Gulf to the Far East and from Europe to Congress. Yes, it was a great honor that I was able to speak in the United States Congress and that the voice of Greece was heard in the capital of the superpower.
