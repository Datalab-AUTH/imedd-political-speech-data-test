Piraeus sends a message of victory and on Sunday we will celebrate the great victory of New Democracy and the victory of Olympiacos in the basketball Final Four.I am very touched by you, friends. It is truly spectacular to receive you today in Piraeus. Just four days before the elections, we are sending the same message from every corner of Greece: Greece will be blue, Piraeus will be blue, Piraeus II will be blue, Piraeus V will be blue, not only Piraeus I.To send together the message of continuing the great effort that we all started together, friends, in July 2019, when we signed the truth agreement, which we have fully respected.
