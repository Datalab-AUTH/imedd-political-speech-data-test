So I would like to ask you, friends, to continue to encourage this great effort that we have started, this blue wave that is now swelling across the country, to continue to encourage it until the last day of the elections.There are five days left until the elections, we will have to do a good finish, we are good marathon runners but we are also good sprinters. Because I want there to be no doubt on the evening of May 21 about the will of the Greek people, about who they will put the responsibility for governing on: on New Democracy, our great party.
