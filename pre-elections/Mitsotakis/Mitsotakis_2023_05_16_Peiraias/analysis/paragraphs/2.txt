Today, despite the difficulties, Greece is a better country. And yes, Piraeus is also a much better city, with a functioning Metro, with important development projects.I visited the Piraeus Tower a while ago and perhaps this is the best picture of Greece that is changing. It had been a 'carcass' for twenty years, it is being transformed into a modern building with 300 employees, with new jobs, with better wages. And as the whole of Piraeus changes, so does our country.
