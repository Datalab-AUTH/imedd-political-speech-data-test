One message I want to convey to you today, here in Piraeus, is that this effort must continue. And it will only continue with a strong New Democracy, the winner of the elections on Sunday.Because indeed, friends, we have gone through "forty waves" during these four years. You know better than anyone how many difficulties we have had to deal with.
