But I am proud that in all the difficulties the state has stood by society and by the most vulnerable.You can see here today, in Piraeus, a market that has been reinvigorated. All this is happening because in the years of the pandemic we supported workers and businesses. In the years of the energy crisis we supported the electricity bills and we have always stood by our most vulnerable fellow citizens.Do you know why? Because we are the great people's party of the country. The party that does not talk about progress in theory, but speaks in practice.
