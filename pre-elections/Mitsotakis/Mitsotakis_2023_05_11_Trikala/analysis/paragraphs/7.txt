We did our duty. We have protected society and put the country on a stable path of development. This growth trajectory must continue at all costs. It is the one that will ultimately bring us better wages and better incomes for all. If I had committed to one thing during the election campaign in 2019, that I would cut taxes and I did it, today I look you in the eye and I am committed to one thing, and that is that I will increase wages for the public and private sector, we will reduce unemployment even further, we will bring it down below 10% and we will continue with the major development projects that are changing the face of Greece.
