What I want to tell you, friends, is that we have a plan for Greece for the next four years. We want to continue to build on the foundations that we have already built. For a Greece that is productive, social, just, strong, with an emphasis on our social face, with an emphasis on our good schools, our good universities. You know, I am very surprised how all the opposition parties are opposed to the important reforms that we are making in education.Yesterday, few of you may know, we had a nationwide competition, what we call the internal PISA. We went to 600 schools and did a sample test in the sixth grade and third grade to see what the level of language and math knowledge of our children is, to see what we need to improve.
