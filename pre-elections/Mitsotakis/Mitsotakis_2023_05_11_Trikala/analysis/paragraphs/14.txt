So I want you, my friends, to give us the opportunity, to give me the opportunity to complete this important project that we have started with our partners.I often compare the Greece that we want to create with a half-built house. We have laid the foundations and we have started to build the floors. But the house is not ready yet. We have a lot of work to do to really get closer to Europe and to feel that we are Europe in everything.
