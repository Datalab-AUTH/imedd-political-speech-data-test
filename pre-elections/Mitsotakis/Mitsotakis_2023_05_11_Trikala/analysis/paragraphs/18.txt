The country needs a stable government today. We have elections in Turkey in two days from now and probably second elections. Turkish revisionism will not disappear. It will be with us in the years to come and the Greek citizens should think, yes, who should be sitting in the Maximus building to manage an aggressive Turkey, which has proven that it can secure the country, build alliances, strengthen the armed forces, make Greece an energy hub in the Balkans. A country that matters.
