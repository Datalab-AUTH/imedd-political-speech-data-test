So, these, friends, are the dilemmas of the elections and the dilemmas that we will have to clarify in the next 10 days. As you can see, I have stopped being completely concerned with what is happening in the opposition. We know them, we know them well. We know who they are, their lies are no longer listened to; when they come here and they give you a programme that exceeds 80 billion euros and they themselves know that they cannot implement it. I challenged them yesterday, I said one simple thing to them: "look, we don't have time to do it now, but because we will probably have a second election, if you dare to take your programme and send it with ours either to the GNI or to the Bank of Greece, so that they can cost the programmes and we can finally see who is telling the truth".
