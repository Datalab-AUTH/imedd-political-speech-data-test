Thank you for this spectacular reception. Trikala sends a message of victory. We will be victorious ten days from now. And the goal, dear President, dear Kostas, dear Mayor, that I am setting here in Trikala is very high. We will not only be above the national average, we will be above the percentage we got in the 2019 elections.
