Three days ago we had a very beautiful event at the Zappeion Hall. I spoke together with Antonis Samaras and Kostas Karamanlis about the European legacy of New Democracy. We remembered that we are the party that put Greece in Europe, against great opposition at the time. The older people remember it, the younger people hear it and learn that everyone was demonstrating at the time from the opposition, shouting 'EEC and NATO the same union'. And yet, Constantine Karamanlis took the country and put it in Europe, in the safe anchorage.We kept Greece in Europe in 2015 and our party will be the one that will make Greece a real European country. So that we can be proud of everything and no longer be the tail-enders and beggars of Europe.
