Many of you had the opportunity, I imagine, yesterday, to watch the debate, the debate, which some of you remember saying that we were not going to a debate. So here we are, we went to a debate and we will go again to another debate if we have to.
But what did the debate show, friends? What did I learn from that experience, three hours of talking to the political leaders? That there is essentially one credible political proposal for governing the country today: the proposal of the New Democracy.On the other hand, there is a progressive shambles. They all agree on only one thing: that they do not want New Democracy to govern and Mitsotakis to be Prime Minister. The Greek people will not indulge them.
