It's up to all of you, because as the President said, yes, you see we have a very good current, we will be victorious, but don't forget on Sunday morning, May 21, when the polls open, the polls are empty. And by the end of the day they must be filled and they must be filled with many New Democracy ballots, so that by the evening of that day one thing is certain: that the Greek people will have sent a clear message that the next government will be the government of New Democracy. So that we can continue, friends, this important effort that we started four years ago, in the midst of so many difficulties. I do not need to mention them to you. We have managed too many crises, we have kept the country safe, we have protected our borders, we have repelled all the attacks on our national sovereignty. We built alliances; our voice is heard today, from the United States Congress to Brussels. Powerful. But at the same time, I also put into practice all my central campaign commitments.
