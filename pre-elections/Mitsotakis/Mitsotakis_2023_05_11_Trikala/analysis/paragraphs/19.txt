These elections are also of geopolitical interest. They are not only of interest for the economy, for education, for health. I am sure that when the polls close, we will be able to celebrate a great victory, which will be a victory not only for New Democracy, but also for our country, for a prosperous, strong Greece that looks ahead and only ahead. So, in conclusion, I would like to ask you, in these 10 days that are left, that we all fight the fight without taking anything for granted; that we go and find the last contestable vote, in the last village, in the last workplace, in your friends. You all know, I am sure, some of our fellow citizens who have not yet decided what to vote for.
