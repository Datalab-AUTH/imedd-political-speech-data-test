We have to fight this battle, to convince them that today the dilemma is: not to have a second time in disaster, but a second chance for the country's prosperity with a stable government of New Democracy, which will continue its work for a better, a stronger, a fairer Greece.When I return, Mayor and my dear Regional Governor, here in Thessaly, in Trikala, we can plan together a second four-year period of prosperity and go to implement it.So let us all go together, strong, bold, forward for a great victory. Thank you very much for this spectacular reception.Good race, good strength and with victory. Be well. Thank you very much.
