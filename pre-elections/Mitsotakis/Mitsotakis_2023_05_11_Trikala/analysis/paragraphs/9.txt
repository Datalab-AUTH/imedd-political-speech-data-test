These are all important projects. Add to that the resources of the Recovery Fund. Mr Tsipras was telling us: 'that he went and negotiated for 17 hours'.  And what did he bring us back?  A third memorandum.  I went and negotiated for 5 days and I brought back 31 billion euros from the Recovery Fund.It is money that you see in the urban renewal projects that are taking place, it is money that you will see in the major irrigation projects, major investments, the Mesochora dam will finally be completed and will add significant renewable energy generation capacity.
