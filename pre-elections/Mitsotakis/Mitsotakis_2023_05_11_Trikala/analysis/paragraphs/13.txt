We have shown the future of the National Health System, which for me is a big bet. How to reduce waiting times in our hospitals, how to recruit 10,000 nurses and doctors in the next four years. How we will invest and rebuild 160 health centres, so important to the region. How we will build the Emergency Departments. How the institution of the personal physician, so that you have someone who can monitor your health before you get to the hospital, can be done and take root. How to continue preventive screening. Women who are with us know that they got a message from the state for the first time, which came and found them and told them: "go get a screening mammogram because you may have breast cancer and not know it." And over 7,000 women were detected early breast cancer that way and will be cured. That's public health in action, with an emphasis on outcomes, not words.
