The first section of the northern axis of the E65 linking Trikala and Kalambaka will be delivered before the end of the year. It is a road that brings Trikala out of isolation. The second section, the southern part which is so important for the whole of Thessaly, will be delivered in the first three months of 2024 and the whole road will be completed by the end of 2025. I made a commitment here in Trikala during the pre-election campaign that the E65 would become a reality, and only we know how many struggles we have put in so that we can untie it and so that western Thessaly can finally come out of its isolation and unfold its development potential. From 378 million from the MIP and NSRF to 554 million available for the whole of Thessaly in the next programming period.
