Friends, I came here today to shake your hand, I could not, there was no way I could complete my election campaign without passing through Thessaly again and without coming especially here in Trikala, where such great things are happening. A city that is a leading player in the development of the country, with a worthy Mayor, with a worthy Regional Governor supporting it, proving that when there is excellent cooperation between local government and central government, we can improve the lives of citizens. To make them better and that, in the end, is the stake of the next day.Was the Mayor right when he said that today the dilemma of the elections is very simple: are we going to move forward on a path of prosperity, on a path of national uplift, on a path of national pride, or are we going to go back to an era of high taxes, of unstable foreign policy, of internal and external insecurity? And Trikala has already voted today. We are going steadily, boldly, forward.
