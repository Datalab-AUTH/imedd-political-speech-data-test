A lot has happened in these four years. All of us have faced unprecedented crises, but we have also faced critical stakes, which we have won and emerged victorious again.Your love gives me strength, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Four years ago, united and strong, we laid the foundations of a new country.With the help of the Greek people, we will continue the important work we have begun. And the day after tomorrow, on the day after tomorrow, on the day of Constantine and Helen, we will continue to build the new Greece. We renew our appointment with the future.
