My friends, the country needs today more than ever before confidence and perspective and that is why the unifying current that brought Greece forward four years ago is growing day by day and expanding. They are all free citizens, far from party blinkers.They are asking for what? Stability and a more optimistic future. That is why they are rallying around the broad progressive front expressed today by our New Democracy, our great party, which has proven that it can renew itself and spread itself, which has proven that it can move forward in a common stride with those who say "no" to adventurism and "yes" to responsible patriotism and creative modernisation. And alongside friends whose mistakes may have upset them, but we have never betrayed them, because we have been consistent in what we said we would do.
