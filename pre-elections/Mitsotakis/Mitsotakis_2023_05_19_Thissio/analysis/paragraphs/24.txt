"Long live New Democracy" can be heard today from here, from Thiseio, all over Greece. But there is one more contributor to this chaos... It was the GDR that always fought for open universities, of knowledge and not of violence. To end the Molotov cocktails, the masked men and to return the public university to those who really belong to it: the students, the professors.I return to the other protagonist of the day, co-conspirator of the chaos that Mr Tsipras envisions: Mr Androulakis.What does it mean to not be the Prime Minister that the citizens vote for? Let him come and tell us here. Let him listen to the voice of the Greek people. The citizens do not only vote for a party, they also vote for a Prime Minister, and I am sorry, but the friends of PASOK - I respect them, I honour them, together we resisted populism - are therefore not keeping an equal distance from the disaster and from the prospect. They must stand by us in this common progress.To be honest, I have said it before, the voters of PASOK, and of other parties, certainly feel that they are living better now than in 2019. They may not vote for us, we will consider the glass half full, they see it half empty, but they do not see it empty and shattered, as Syriza says.So they will not risk what they have conquered. And they will certainly not become the crutch of the one who until yesterday was their rival.
