On Sunday we weigh, decide and vote. And the responsibility falls heavily on the shoulders of every citizen. Voting is a choice, not an evasion. It leaves no room for frivolity, nor for experiments.After all, here, under the Holy Rock, the words of Pericles always apply: 'when the city prospers, it benefits each citizen more than when each individual prospers. While when the city has gone downhill, he who prospers privately, if the country is destroyed, will suffer the same fate"; therefore we must march united in this constant struggle for prosperity. We are together in the dangers. As we are together in the future of hope, of optimism, that we can build a new Greece better, for a better life for all Greek women, for all Greeks. The country that we want and that each and every one of us deserves. And this is the message that I ask you, the soul of the party, to carry to every district, to every home, until the last moment.Don't forget that on Sunday morning all the polling stations will be empty. By the evening they must be filled with millions of New Democracy ballots. Blue will embrace the whole country, from the Othonians to Kastelorizo, from Evros to Gavdos.Go ahead, keep our flags, our eyes and our hearts high. We start from the Acropolis.  The symbol of Athens. For a self-reliant Greece and a self-reliant New Democracy.On 21 May we vote, on 22 May we continue. We move steadily, boldly and only forward. We are going together for the great victory.Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this amazing gathering, for your love. Let us go together to win. Let us go together to lift Greece up. Be well. Thank you. And with victory.
