And perhaps most importantly, Turkey is about to have second elections. The result of our ballot box will also travel to the other side of the Aegean. Think twice, today, May 19, the day of commemoration of the genocide of our Pontian brothers and sisters.And let us agree here that the message of the ballot box must, above all, be a message of stable and strong leadership, a signal that the country will have an experienced and strong hand at the helm.Friends, as we come to the end of this very beautiful election period, finally, you know, this is the dilemma you have before you: who do you want as Prime Minister of the country. That is what the citizens will answer; but we will also answer something else: whether we want stability or lasting uncertainty. Whether we want relief and increases or tax raids and cuts, a return to the Katrougalos era; whether we keep the country safe or make it weak in the face of every threat. In other words, do we ultimately want New Democracy to continue its work, yes or no?
