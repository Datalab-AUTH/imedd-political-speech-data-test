Because today, in our last pre-election meeting, I want to talk a little more about the crucial battle that we are facing: facing constant uncertainty, facing the most ruthless opponents, who disagree with each other but together are betting on the "landmine" of proportional representation. A trap of ungovernability that must be cancelled by our vote before it becomes a national weakness and collective paralysis.I see Mr Tsipras raising his finger, while he has failed both as a government and as an opposition, first by burdening the country with an unnecessary third memorandum. Mr President, Mr Antonis Samaras, we knew how close we had brought the country to completing the evaluation. We did not need the third memorandum. It was unnecessary, the result of the tragic negotiation that took place in the first half of 2015, and of course, then as the opposition when we said "no" to armaments, "no" to the fence, "no" to increases, "no" to the rights of our fellow citizens with disabilities. He even said 'no' to the exclusion of the Golden Dawn cutthroat. Now we know why he did it: because he is the only political leader who unabashedly 'turns a blind eye' to the Golden Dawn vote.
