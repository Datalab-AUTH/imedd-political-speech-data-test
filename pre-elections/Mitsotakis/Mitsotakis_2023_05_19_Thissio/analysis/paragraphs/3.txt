I was happy, as I was coming and crossing this huge crowd, to see old fighters and new friends of the party around me.I know the capital well, as a member of the Parliament of Athens for 20 years now. I can assure you that this blue river is indeed unprecedented for our city. And this overwhelming presence is not only incomparably greater, it is also incomparably more dynamic than the one in 2019.I remember very well, friends, this gathering four years ago, when I stood on the very same platform under the shadow of the Acropolis. I did not promise you miracles then, but a lot of work and concrete actions.
