And, of course, I cannot fail to say a word, Mr. Mayor, about the other big project that is going on here a little further away - and that was a commitment we made. Yes, Panathinaikos will finally get the stadium it deserves.  With significant funding from the state, with support from the region, with support from the municipality. The bulldozers are already in place and this is a major project, not only for Panathinaikos, but a major redevelopment project for the whole city of Athens.
