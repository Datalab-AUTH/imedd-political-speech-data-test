A word about our pensioners, because I know how much you were hurt by the Katrougalos law and how much anger you felt from those who promised you that they would tear up the memoranda "with a law and an article" and then came and smashed you. They levelled your pensions and now they have the audacity to say, 'but we', he says, 'we were giving you the 13th pension and then', he says, 'Mitsotakis came and cut it off'. The answer is that we gave pensioners a raise for the first time in 12 years, 8%. We are the ones who are coming to correct, even partially, the personal difference of Katrougalos. I pledge that I will continue to support pensioners with a personal difference until it is erased.
