I have never hidden, friends. Never. And whenever mistakes were made, I went before the Greek people, acknowledged my responsibility and said that it was my duty to correct the mistakes that were made. I am not infallible, nor have I promised miracles. But the Greece of 2023 is nothing like the Greece of 2019 and that is something that should make us all very proud. And with a voice, of course, which is heard abroad. From the Middle East to Brussels, from the Far East to the United States Congress, the voice of Greece is heard. And that has a special significance. Because, tomorrow, you know, our great neighbour has elections. I'm not going to make any predictions about the election results and I say in advance that I'm prepared to work with whomever the Turkish people choose. But we know what we have been through these 3.5 years and we know what we had to do to keep the country strong. How we shielded our borders, how we invested in our armed forces, how we built alliances, how we strengthened the economy. So these elections are not just about the economy, health care, the welfare state, they are also about foreign policy. Our world is not going to get easier all of a sudden. There is instability everywhere, you see it. It matters who sits in the next day in the Maximus building and for the defence of national positions. So all this, I am sure that the citizens will think about it very carefully.
