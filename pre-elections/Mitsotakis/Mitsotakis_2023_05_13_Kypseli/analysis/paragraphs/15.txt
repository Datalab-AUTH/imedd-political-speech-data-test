This means, to put it simply, politics in practice. We emphasise the result. We are proud of our values. I want to say a big thank you to all the old fighters of the New Democracy. A special thank you to those who have never abandoned us and who have kept the party standing in very difficult times. But I also want to say a big welcome to our new friends. To those who have stood with us since 2019, who have created this great current of victory of progressive patriotism, of creative modernisation, this current of victory, which is bubbling up again in these elections. Have no doubt that there will be fellow citizens who will vote for us for the first time in these elections. Because they have seen, judged, compared and decided that they deserve a government that is effective, that whenever mistakes are made, does not hesitate to acknowledge them.
