We are now launching a new, special "Savings for Young People", up to 30,000 euros. You have an old apartment which is not habitable. You pass it on to your children for the first time without tax, because we have abolished the tax on parental benefits. And a young child can get up to 30,000 euros of help to rebuild the apartment, make it habitable and get out of rent and into their own home.
