I don't like to talk about things that I know I cannot deliver tomorrow, unlike some others who promise you programmes that cost more than 80 billion. But, watch out, when we challenge them and say, "Guys, let's not argue about our programs, there's one way to see who's telling the truth, let's all come together and have a third party, independent, cost them. Don't you want the GAO? The Bank of Greece. You don't want the Bank of Greece? The Economic Council of the Parliament." Silence. Because they know very well that they are telling you things that cannot become reality and they don't care, of course, because they know deep down that they are not going to win the elections.
