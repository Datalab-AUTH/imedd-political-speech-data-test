We have eight days. I want to ask you not to be complacent for a moment. Yes, the current is strong, I can see it everywhere. Everywhere I go, friends, we are having much larger gatherings than we did in 2019. I also see our opponents-I can't help but comment on that. We're here right now on one of the biggest pedestrian streets in Athens - the mayor will complain a little bit because we're going to mess up his lawn but that's okay, we'll fix that - with a lot of people. Everywhere he goes, he went to Alexandroupolis, he chose the smallest pedestrian street and still couldn't fill it up. And wherever he goes, his rallies start an hour and a half late, before it gets dark and it becomes clear that he can't actually get anyone to his rallies. But, anyway, that gives us a sense of the mood, of how we're heading into the election, but the election is decided when the last ballot is counted. I won't tire of saying it: when the ballot box is opened, it's empty. It is empty. At the end of the day, it should be filled with many New Democracy ballots. That's your job, our job and the job of our excellent candidates here in Athens, where we really have a very, very good ballot paper. Let us not be complacent until the last moment, let us go after the last vote, so that on Sunday night there is no doubt. Regardless of the electoral laws, regardless of simple proportional representation, on the evening of 21 May we will know who will govern Greece for the next four years, and that will be New Democracy, our great party. Thank you very much. Together we will fight the fight to the last moment and with victory. Here we are again, big winners. Be well. Thank you very much.
