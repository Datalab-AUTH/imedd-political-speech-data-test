But it's not the only project that will change the look of the area. I want to talk to you about our new vision for the new Archaeological Museum. I imagine you've already seen how the architectural competition has been completed. We are talking about a real jewel. The studies are starting immediately. When the Archaeological Museum is completed, as we envision it, it will provide a huge boost to development throughout the city centre. Again, Kypseli - and not only - will benefit from an Athens that is changing, that is becoming more friendly for its inhabitants and of course much more pleasant for its visitors.
