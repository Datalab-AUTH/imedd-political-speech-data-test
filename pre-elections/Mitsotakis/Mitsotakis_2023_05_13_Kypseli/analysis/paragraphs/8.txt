These are just a few examples of what will happen in the next four years and can happen under one condition: that New Democracy continues to hold the helm of the country. To emphasise the major priorities of the second four-year term. First and foremost, how to raise wages and improve incomes. We were the ones - look - who took the minimum wage from 650 euros and brought it up to 780 euros. You will say to me, "Is that enough?". I will be the first to tell you that it is not enough, because I know that today in our country wages are still low. The minimum wage can go to EUR 950 and the average wage to EUR 1 500. On inflation, I will just say one word to you. I know how big the problem of accuracy is and you know what we have done to help you. But inflation will come down at some point, but tax cuts and wage increases are here to stay. This is ultimately the way we permanently improve people's disposable income.
