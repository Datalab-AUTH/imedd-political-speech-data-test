The Metro, Line 4, Kipseli Station, is the biggest public project that is currently being done in the country, 1.5 billion. Nobody dared to start it, we are starting it, the "metro" has already been put in and started digging, the construction sites have already started. Yes, it will take time, we know, these projects are not finished overnight. But know that the moment it's finished we'll be talking about another Hive, we'll be talking about other values on your properties. I believe this will help this neighborhood as a whole, which is so identified with the fabric of our city, to breathe, to breathe and to grow primarily for the benefit of the Hive residents who have stayed, persevered and kept this neighborhood vibrant and beautiful as it is today.
