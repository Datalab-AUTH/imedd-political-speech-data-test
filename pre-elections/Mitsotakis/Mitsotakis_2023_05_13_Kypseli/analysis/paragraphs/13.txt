Some people accuse us of saying that the middle class is living on benefits. My answer is: know that with New Democracy, in every difficulty the state will be there for you. Listen carefully, because we are a social party and we do not abandon our weakest fellow citizens. However, we know that subsidised aid is a temporary solution. The permanent solution, I will say it again, is wage increases, it is tax cuts, it is investments that bring growth. An investment may be Microsoft coming to Greece, but it is also an investment when a shopkeeper here takes a European programme and makes energy renovations and hires two or three more workers. That too is an investment. We are not just talking about large investments. Investment is what will be done here in the properties in your area. With all of the "Save Money" programs, which allow you to take old apartments that may be closed and renovate them.
