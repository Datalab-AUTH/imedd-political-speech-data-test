The great importance that I attach, friends, to our programmatic speech, I want to highlight it here today, and I want to ask you, in this last week that remains before the elections, not to engage in inexpensive arguments with our political opponents, but to talk to the citizens about our own plan for the next day, for the future of our country. After all, I believe that, more or less, our opponents have probably discounted the election result. I was reading today in an opposition newspaper - it came out with a pithy headline - '53% say they do not want a second four-year term for Mitsotakis'. So 47% want a second four-year term. I see us with self-reliance on the first Sunday. And they themselves admit it.
