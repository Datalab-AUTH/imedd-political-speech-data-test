The next four years will be the four years in which we will continue the great changes in the state. Gov.gr is a revolution for all of us, you know it very well, but we still have to continue on this path of digitalisation, to continue on the path of better health care. The new National Health System is a big personal bet of mine. We know what difficulties we went through during the pandemic and how we kept the National Health System standing. We saw its strengths, but we also saw its weaknesses. We will recruit 10,000 doctors and nurses over the next four years. And I will move heaven and earth to ensure that these recruitments are made on merit but as soon as possible. We will rebuild all the emergency departments in our hospitals. We will rebuild our health centers. We will place a strong emphasis on the Personal Doctor, an important reform that we have implemented for the first time, and an equally strong emphasis on preventive examinations. Prevention is what saves lives, my friends.  Consider that today there are 7,000 women who have already been identified with early breast cancer because we have implemented a programme of preventive screening. These women have a very good prognosis. Their lives will literally be saved by these screenings that they have had. That's how we understand public health for all and for all, with a focus on good hospitals, to reduce waiting times, to the personal doctor, to prevention. Hold on to what I'm saying: four years from now, the National Health System will be completely different from what it is today, and you know that I keep my commitments.
