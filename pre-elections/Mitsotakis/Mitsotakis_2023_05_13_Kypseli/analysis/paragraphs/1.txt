Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Mr Mayor, Mr Regional Mayor, ladies and gentlemen candidates, New Democrats, eight days from now we will be the big winners. On 21 May we will send the message of victory and progress for every Greek woman and every Greek man, and we will certainly send it from Athens. Here, from the 6th district, from Kypseli, from Fokionos Negri, where I used to come as a boy. I remember what it was like, I remember the difficulties it went through and I am glad that, just as the whole country is finding its way again, so too is Kipseli finding its way again. For a Greece of progress, of prosperity, of development, of social cohesion. There are only eight days left until the elections. I have travelled all over Greece and I will continue to fight until the last moment, until the end of the election period, to convince the Greeks that we must continue on this path of progress. That we must look ahead, we must aim high and we must not turn back to the past. We must not turn back. Because this is ultimately the great dilemma of the upcoming elections. You know better than we do how many difficulties we have gone through together during these four years. We have overcome a migrant invasion in Evros, a pandemic, an aggressive neighbour, an energy crisis, a war in Ukraine, natural disasters.
