To the best of our ability. Because one thing we cannot disturb, friends. That is the right course of public finances. We have proved that we can put the finances in order, we can put the shop in order, we can bring growth, and we can support society. I stand by that. Think of how much money we gave away during the COVID. Think about how many subsidies we gave out so that you can see on your electricity bills every month what you would pay without the government subsidy and what you pay with the government subsidy. We have achieved all of this precisely because the economy is growing faster and we have been able to support society. All the shops here in Fokionos Negri, which are open today, are full of people, working people. We had to close all of them during the pandemic. But we came and supported the shopkeepers, the workers, the businesses, and that is why the shops are open today. That would not have been the picture.
