Despite the difficulties, we kept the country standing and society united.  We put the economy on a growth track. We are growing at more than 3% a year, twice the rate of the Eurozone, but at the same time this growth did not come by overtaxing the middle class, nor by crushing pensioners; it came by cutting taxes, by increasing pensions, by cutting contributions. We have implemented our election programme in full, despite the great difficulties. Today we have every reason to be optimistic, to be able to look to the future with more confidence. Because the Greece of the next four years can be a Greece in which everything really will change.
