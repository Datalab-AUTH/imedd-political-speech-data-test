Here, in our remote Thrace, the members of the Armed Forces know how much we have strengthened the army with modern armoured vehicles, with ammunition, but also with increases in salaries and allowances for our servicemen and women on the front line.But, they also know that the workers in our shipyards, which have been revived, know that we are also supporting this sector of the economy, because our shipyards are also reviving and growing along with the country's defence industry.We had reached the point - think of a country with such a large merchant fleet, with a navy that has to be maintained - where all our shipyards were basically under-utilised.
