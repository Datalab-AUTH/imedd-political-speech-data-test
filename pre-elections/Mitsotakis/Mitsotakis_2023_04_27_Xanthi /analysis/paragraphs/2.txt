Let me tell you a little story. Mr Tsipras came to my place, Chania, and he said he would speak in the same square where I had spoken. The speech was for seven o'clock and he went to seven thirty and went to eight and went to eight thirty and went to the podium at eight forty, because half the square was empty.
