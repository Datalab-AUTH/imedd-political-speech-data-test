Important steps have also been taken in education, but more needs to be done. 25,000 permanent teacher appointments, 1,400 here in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia alone. I am sure we will have some among us.We had 62 Standard and Experimental schools in the country, now we have 138. In Xanthi, in fact, we have a primary kindergarten and a primary school. Soon, in fact, from the fifth grade to high school, all students in all public schools, in 36,000 classrooms, will be taught by digital interactive whiteboards, because that is how we see the future of education.But there is still a lot to be done, especially in vocational education. You have the excellent Democritus University, which you know how much we support. We have also been consistent in our commitment to the establishment of the Department of Psychology in Didymoteicho. We said it, we did that too.
