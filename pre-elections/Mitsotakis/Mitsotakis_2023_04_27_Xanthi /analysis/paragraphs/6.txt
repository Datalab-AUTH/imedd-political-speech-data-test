We shielded -k. Minister, as you well know, our Armed Forces. But we have also found ways to stem the tide of power increases and imported precision. But we also found ways, despite great difficulties, despite great crises, to put into practice all that we promised in July 2019. So today, the country - the "dry vineyard" is a thing of the past. Just as those who did not see borders at sea or kept them open are past. Our coastguards at sea, our amazing border guards in Evros, have almost zeroed the flows of illegal migrants. The abomination of Moria and Samos has been replaced by humane accommodation structures. Our islands, which I will also have the opportunity to visit in this beautiful election period, have long been relieved.
