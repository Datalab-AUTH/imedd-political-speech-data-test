We are ready to examine with Turkey our basic dispute, which is none other than the delimitation of the maritime zones in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, always in accordance with international law. But we are always unwilling to tolerate any challenge to our sovereign rights, so what is important is for the other side of the Aegean to be careful in its words and, I hope, true in its intentions. We will be the first to respond, as I said, to any gesture of goodwill.
