It is the only way, my friends, to increase our wages, which are still - I am the first to admit it - low in our country; we can increase our wages in four years by 25%. It is possible. The average salary should reach 1,500 euros and the minimum should reach 950 euros.For civil servants, for the first time in a long time, we will have a new single pay scale. 500 million more will be made available for increases for civil servants.
