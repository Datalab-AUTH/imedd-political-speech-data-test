When you thank a country for its assistance in the earthquakes - yes, because we were the first to rush in, we were the first to help the Turkish people in the face of an unprecedented natural disaster - you cannot at the same time acknowledge this gesture of goodwill and at the same time provoke it.That is why I want to reiterate our clear positions here in Xanthi. We are consistent, we are not naive. We respond to any aggression with readiness, we do not engage in dialogue with the irrational, but we always embrace and reciprocate any gesture of goodwill.
