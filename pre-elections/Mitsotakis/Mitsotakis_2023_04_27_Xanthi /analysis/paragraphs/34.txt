Allow me to add one more parenthesis here, to illustrate the erratic nature of the political discourse of our main political opponent.We had this paradox a few days ago. Mr Tsipras went to Kos and announced as his own political initiative, as his proposal, which is already in place, the use - he says - of private doctors on the islands. This is already happening, with a law passed by the New Democracy. When we were passing the relevant provision, he was the one who shouted that we were supposedly privatising health care. It is just proof that it is not only health that is in trouble, but also some people who, unfortunately, do not take it seriously at all.
