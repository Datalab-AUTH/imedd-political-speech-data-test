Let me tell you that I was very happy to go to Sunlight today. I met a young engineer and there are many examples in this company who can tell the same story that she told me: 12 years I worked in the UK, engineering electric car batteries. I decided and came back, now I live and work in Xanthi and I am very happy about my choice. This is what reversing the brain drain means in practice. Good jobs all over the region.
