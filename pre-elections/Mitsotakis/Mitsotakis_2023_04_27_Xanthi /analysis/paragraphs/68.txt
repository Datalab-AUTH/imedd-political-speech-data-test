And this - let me conclude with some general political remarks - makes the importance of these elections even more crucial. Because, in front of us, we have an incorrigible Syriza, which has failed as a government. It has turned Greece into a centre for migrants passing through, it has burdened us with 100 billion additional costs from the memoranda, but it has also done something even worse: It poisoned society with division and simplistic slogans.
