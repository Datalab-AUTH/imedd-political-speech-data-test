That is why May 21 will ultimately determine who will govern. And the more thunderous the message, the more easily the second ballot box will arm the winner with the power to govern the country effectively.That is why the vote, on the day of Constantine and Helen, is clear: Self-empowered Greece, self-empowered New Democracy, a vote for the celebration of democracy.We start the race with the truth about our work as our starting point, explaining to all our fellow citizens why New Democracy must be the big winner on May 21. All of Greece will be blue, ready to move firmly, boldly, only forward.
