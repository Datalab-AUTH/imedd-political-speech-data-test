I'm opening a parenthesis. Friends, I was listening to Mr Tsipras saying: "give me the first chance to govern without memoranda". I replied: it was you who put us in the third memorandum, with the regressions of the first half of 2015: "give me the first chance to govern without a coronovirus, without a migration crisis, without Turkey". But I will not tell you.
