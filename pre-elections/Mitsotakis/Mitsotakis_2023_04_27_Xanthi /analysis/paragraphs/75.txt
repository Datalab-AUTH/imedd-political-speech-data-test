I'll say it again, no mistake can be corrected after the ballot box. Evil will have happened much more when you know our opponents are ruthless. I will say it again and I mean what I say. I don't believe anything they say. I recall that they said one thing and did another in the "bloody referendum"; I recall that they were proclaiming then, in August '15, that they would not hold another election and they did. They were proclaiming that they would stay in their positions to ally with the far right of Kamenos.
