The whole of Greece has basically been turned into a big construction site. I don't want to talk too much about that, because I want to focus more on what we are going to do from now on, what we have to do. About how we are going to overcome our weaknesses, how we are going to correct the mistakes, which yes, we have the courage to identify them so that we can correct them.
