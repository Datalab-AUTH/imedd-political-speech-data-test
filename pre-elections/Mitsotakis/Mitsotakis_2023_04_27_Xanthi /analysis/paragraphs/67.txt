That is why this government programme that I have presented to you has specific timetables. It costs about 8 billion over a four-year horizon. These are resources - compare, 8 billion for us, 45 billion for others - that have secured funding. And it is our response to the lies of the opponents, which are promises without measure. These will either lead to a new tax raid, or most likely - if ever, which is why they will never be implemented, which is why they are so easily said - they would lead to a new bankruptcy and a new memorandum.
