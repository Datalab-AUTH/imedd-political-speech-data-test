Ladies and friends, I want you to know that all these things that I have talked about briefly may be ambitious, but they are absolutely realistic.They are as realistic as our plan was realistic in 2019, when we told you that, yes, we can cut taxes, but because we will put the economy on a growth path, we can stimulate public revenues. So that we have resources to support society in crises, while at the same time reducing public debt.Those 2019 targets seemed distant at the time. I remember when I was talking to you, at that time many citizens trusted us, but there was a suspicion in their eyes. They were saying, "Is Mitsotakis now just another politician who is just another politician who is shaking and cannot deliver what he is telling us?".Friends, there is one thing I will never negotiate. That is my personal political credibility. What I am telling you, I know that we can implement.
