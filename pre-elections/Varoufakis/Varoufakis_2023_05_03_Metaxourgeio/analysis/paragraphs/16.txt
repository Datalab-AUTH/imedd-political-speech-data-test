Two words about the executioner, I can't leave it out. Everyone is talking about the executioner, I can't help but talk a little bit. By the way, just before I came. I remembered, I had forgotten, I came across it by accident in a Financial Times article. Not a left-wing paper, the Financial Times. June 2015. Where a Financial Times journalist explains that the payment system I was designing at the time. I had also written an article in the Financial Times very recently. Maybe it was the solution. On the issues. Of the fiscal policy of the countries of the European Union. Just so I can remind you is to remember it myself. Look at what the Demeter tell you what it is? It is a first step of liberation from the bankers, both private and central bankers is the future. It is. The use of technology for the first time not by the oligarchy. But by a government our government, which will create a system of digital free payments, not to be wasted by bankers, not to be able to close our banks. The central bankers and we can make transactions, put our savings there without having to worry. For the interests of Mr. John Paulson, the criminal who has taken over Piraeus without having to worry. If Mr Draghi, Mrs Lagarde, now close our banks, that cannot be tolerated. Greek. Oligarch. This cannot be opened. The PASOK man who voted for all the memoranda. Because what will happen otherwise? They close the banks.
