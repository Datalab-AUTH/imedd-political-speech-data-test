I take the opportunity because today is a youth rally to not, as you can see, do a traditional election rally. Talk talk talk talk. Because you have given me this opportunity and I thank you very much for that. Because the election for us is an opportunity, it is not an end in itself. The day 25 alliance for the rupture we use the election. Not as an objective. But as a means. To build what our youth need the new great militant left that will lay the foundations. So that you can think about how to conquer power. To be able to think about how to take the means of production into your own hands so that you can liberate yourselves. Not from technology, but from them. Who have in their hands. The ownership of technology that has always been pitted against the have-nots. These property rights. That's what the agonist left means. This whole process of devaluation, because this is devaluation. Since I said the word devaluation.
