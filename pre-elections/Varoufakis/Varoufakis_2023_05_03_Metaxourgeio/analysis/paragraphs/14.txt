This is the situation that we face worldwide, of course. That is why it is important not to forget our internationalism, compañeros and compañeros fellow travellers. Why is it not possible for us to entrench ourselves here and forget that every year three and a half million households are thrown out on the street in America? Do you know that? We have been talking about foreclosures three and a half million families are thrown out on the street. Recently I was listening to a podcast from MPR the New York State radio station about a case. The bailiffs came in. That had sent a bank to an apartment. And they found two orphans. Their mother had died. And she was dead inside the apartment. They kicked them out and threw the orphans in the street. They took them out in a suitcase and left them in the street.
