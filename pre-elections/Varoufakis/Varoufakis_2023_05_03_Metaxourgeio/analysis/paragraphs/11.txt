Female infanticide. Sadism. Discrimination against LGBTI people all of it. It's a thing just as much as it is a thing. The clinics. The red loans, the predatory funds that they do to our universities. Two words about labor. Just between you and me, don't tell anyone. Every May Day, every time we have a strike. And we all march on the stadium we go to the Constitution Addition and I see those banners of the official trade union bodies of the Adedi GSEE. I really feel very, very difficult to be with those banners. Of the labor leaders. Who have no interest in the labour dallas comrades, comrades-in-arms, comrades-in-arms, comrades-in-arms, comrades-in-arms, comrades-in-arms. We must bend very carefully over the great challenges that a new trade union movement will have. Youth rights. Who have no interest in the struggle of the classes that is taking place with their own blessing. These state-sponsored trade unionists must be finished with them a new trade unionism is needed, a new trade unionism that is already beginning to be born. We have seen this with e Food we see it in the biowe see what real unionism is. The equivalent of the militant left that we are building. What does militant, new trade unionism mean, it's only workerism not just the establishment.
