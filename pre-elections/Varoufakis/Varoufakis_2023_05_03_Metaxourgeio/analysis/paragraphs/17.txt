Mr Mitsotakis cannot open up. Friends will call, friends will say what did you do? We had a monopoly on the payment system. It's like owning all the roads and tolling anyone who goes to the kiosk to get a chocolate and missing it. You're going to allow them to take that monopoly away from us and of course you can't accept it if you are. Part of the SYRIZA. Which gave land and water. And what does it tell us that it saved the country? Because he said yes to everything. To keep the banks from closing.
