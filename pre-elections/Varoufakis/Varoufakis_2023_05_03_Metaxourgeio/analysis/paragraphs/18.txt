If we do not liberate society from finance capital, we will not be able to take the next step, which is. That which Charles Marx taught us about along with Friedrich Engels. That it cannot exist. Nor democracy. No stability. If the means of production are not socialized. Without bosses, who will protect us from the bosses? It is. The number one question in the minds of young people and older people, but young people have decades ahead of them. of oppression by the bosses. But there is another question that I am asked by many young people and many young people, don't you think? From the bureaucrat.

And of course they condemned them as absolutely ridiculous and ludicrous. Without our own representative of course commenting, that's the quality of their democracy to enjoy.
