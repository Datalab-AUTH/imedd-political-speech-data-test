2 people, young scientists.Let's build a company. A cooperative. For new technologies for some application for anything, for new technologies in the agricultural economy. And each one of these people that comes in should have a share. That doesn't mean they'll have the same wages. They may democratically agree that you know what Helen we need her more because she has better know-how than Kostas and me and we will pay her more right, but it will be decided democratically as far as the shares are concerned. The proposal is very simple through the system, a system like the demitra, whoever wants to lend to whomever wants to lend to whomever wants to lend to the companies, but no one can buy the future surplus value of working proletarians. This is the idea behind one share, one worker, one vote.
