So when this happens in the best countries of capitalism, what do we here expect to be treated with the glove if we don't rise up? If we don't all stand up and take our fate into our own hands, to turn against the local manifestation of the oligarchy without borders. If we do not join hands with the working class of Germany, the working class of America, China, India worldwide. We will not be able to. To be able to look at what is in the next generations and say we did our duty. Are you young people getting ready, you young people?
