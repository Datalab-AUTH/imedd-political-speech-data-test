Companions. Fellow comrades. Elections are an excuse for us, they are a pretext, they are a means to something very big, which we are building here tonight in Athens, which you are building because you will live in the conditions that it will create? This is the great militant faction conditions that will give you the right, as I said before, to look at the next generation, the generation of your own children and say we have done our duty, we have done our duty. We have made our country viable again in an international environment that does not falter in war and in the orchestrated. Malice of a capital that eventually turns against itself as well as a virus that kills the organism in which it lives today here alliance for rupture day 25 begins with a very beautiful struggle in which I invite you to be, not shareholders. Nor co-owners, but to be leaders. All together all together thank you.
