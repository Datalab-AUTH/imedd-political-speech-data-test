Good evening. To all and sundry. It's a great pleasure to be together. Let me begin by taking the risk of reminding you. How old am I compared to you? Which one of you has heard of Sid Vicious and the Sex Pitchers? You remember God Save the Queen. 1977. This microphone is going off, microphone Please. 1977 I remember then shortly after I was in England. I liked the song, but as a Marxist Greek. Traditionalist. In my way of thinking I thought the lyrics were reactionary. Why? Somewhere it said there is no future for you and for me there is no future. How right were they? Why? Two years later Thatcher comes along. And she imposes the policies. I'm not saying yes neoliberal, they were neither young nor liberal they were policies please take this microphone away from me right now. Isn't this microphone so hard to use here, guys? Thank you, Marianna, the secretary of the People's Unity Party. Thank you. That's how we do everything ourselves. Politics. Class warfare against the working class was a result of the crisis of the 70s.
