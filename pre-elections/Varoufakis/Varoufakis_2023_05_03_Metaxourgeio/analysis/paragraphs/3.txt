In our country at this moment today that we're talking about. If you look at the cost of living youth rents. Taxes. Even for young people who pay relatively low taxes because they have low incomes. Cost of telecommunications, cell phones. All those things that make up 80%, 90% of young people's expenses are. The highest cost of living for youth in the whole European Union. Second is Denmark. As a cost. Which is much lower with huge incomes compared to us. It is no coincidence that our youth. Is forced into the hardest dilemma. Between taking their eyelashes and leaving. Or stay? With shattered dreams.
