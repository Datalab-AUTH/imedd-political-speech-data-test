Never mind that people have understood, as they understood the week before the referendum, that. That demonisation meant that we who said no knew something. The same thing is happening and is happening today and you will see that. The more we are demonised the more we are vilified and talked about without us, the more we are reinforced. We should thank them. Is that so? What was very, very entertaining was watching them try. To hit us with the idea of the self-managed essence of the socialist structure of an enterprise, that is, saying, what an entrepreneur would put up the capital and distribute the shares equally to all the workers. They can't have their minds like Aristotle, Aristotle. He could not conceive of a society without slaves. It was impossible so he thought that work was both legal and moral. And so our channels can't imagine that there can be a life and a cooperative.
