That's why it's important that after 15 we came back here as DIEM 25 some of you were here when we were in a cinema down here and we laid the foundations and then in 2019 we got a parliamentary seat here in Heraklion we put the no again in the Parliament, we sweated the jersey in and out of Parliament for 4 years now it's not, we just said no. The no was a trigger for us to constantly submit proposals. We didn't expect, we had no illusions that the system would say Ah what a great idea this is, we will adopt it, of course not, but what did we do? We were responding to citizens who are not interested in the left, who are not interested in political parties, because that is the majority of citizens. Badly, but that is the reality. And they say they ask you if you were the government, would you have done? Take a proposal for a law. Take an amendment to see exactly in legal language what we would have done. That's what responsible disobedience means, it means not being obedient to the dictates of the troika oligarchy and at the same time saying here's what I would have done this morning before the second coming before socialism.
