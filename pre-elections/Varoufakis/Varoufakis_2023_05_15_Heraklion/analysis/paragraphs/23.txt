So, fellow comrades, let us be clear when you tell us when they tell us to come after Sunday, Monday 22 May, to form a government, do you know what they tell us? We tell you lies. They demand that the leaders of SYRIZA demand that I stand on this platform, look at our people here in Heraklion and lie to your faces, that is to say, tell you to vote for us for the break. Vote for us to abolish the energy exchange, vote for us to move VAT from 24 to 15%. Vote for us to abolish the Super Fund and transfer public assets to a development and agricultural bank. Vote to abolish Hercules and replace them with Odysseus. Vote for me on all these things and I will go on Monday morning and make Tsipras Prime Minister so that he does none of these things. Well no, they didn't get slaughtered, I'm not going to tell you that and I'm not going to do that on Monday morning. Because we the Cretans and the false Cretans. We know all too well that the only way to be patriotic is to be internationalist. The only way to be an internationalist is to be a true patriot, because you can only love the whole world if you have loved your country, as Kazantzakis used to say.
