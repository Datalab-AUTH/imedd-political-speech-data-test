Good evening to all in Heraklion. Although I am a Rethymnian, don't say it out of order I feel more at home in Heraklion than in Rethymno than in Chania. Which I love of course, but I don't know why maybe because it reminds me a bit of Athens as a Pseudo-Cretan Athenian. With Heraklion the Mera 25, DIEM 25 from the bays in which Mera 25 was born, we have a tradition with Heraklion.
