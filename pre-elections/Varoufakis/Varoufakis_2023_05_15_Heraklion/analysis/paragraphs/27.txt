So because as another intellectual said, Oscar Wilde will never happen if the meetings and events of the left go on until midnight. I'll let you go, say goodbye and tell you that the real campaigning starts Sunday night. What we're doing today, you know what it is; warming up. Warm-up rehearsal for what? Mitsotakis and Tsipras are going to burn the simple proportional representation. It's a sure thing, and from Monday morning we start from Sunday night we'll be on the channels on whichever one they put us on, not on Mega. On whichever channels they dare to put us on even for 2 minutes, we will tell them that now begins the struggle for the first rupture. Now we will give everything for the break, because everything can be different. Thank you very much, we are moving on.
