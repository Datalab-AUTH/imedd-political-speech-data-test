Remember? It was also in 2015 we'll be here in St. Titus some of you, the elders who were talking about the rift back then, when some, unfortunately fifth column in our government were pulling the rug out from under the rift. That's why the break never happened in 2015. That's why we're talking about break for the first time now since day 25 alliance for break. We started DIEM 25 after that capitulation of Syriza, the overthrow of the people is the first time in history that a government of the left has overthrown the people on that referendum night, resulting in the continued flight of our young people. And those young people who did not leave that day and before, of course, have to live here in a crouching state of galley conditions, whether they work in hotels, catering or work as hired labour in these hordes of hired labourers. That is why that no vote was important, so that we do not end up where we are now. With a predetermined course if there is no break. The desertification of this place.
