So they say to me, you guys find them. Find them. Let's take down Cooly, that's not what you're telling us on the streets, some of you are not, you're here to be here, you're conscious, many of you, the most passers-by. Look at the time Kyriakos leaves Maximus, we're all going to have a party. Is there any doubt about that? But we are on the left. What does it mean that we are left? We don't personify politics. We understand that the system does not rely on Mitsotakis to expand the existing Mitsotakism, we want to bring down both Mitsotakis and the existing Mitsotakism, which will not go away if Mitsotakis simply leaves. I want you to put me in the box, put me in the box with all your goodwill, if we do not abolish the energy exchange, if I do not abolish Heracles, if they do not abolish the Hyperfund, if I do not transfer public property to a development bank, if I do not abolish the institution of hired labour for both young and old. If we do not establish the Demeter to stop our people being wasted 2 billion a year by the bankers. To have a digital state of the art payment system free of charge, not controlled by Frankfurt. The occupying forces of this serfdom, if I don't do this. What will I do? Make nice speeches? Which will do what, humiliate the name of breakthrough, humiliate the name of the left, humiliate all of you.
