And now various former comrades of SYRIZA are coming and saying, "Come on, Yannis, let's come and form a government on Monday morning if the pine cones come out. Look what they have been telling us for 2 years now: Fine, we don't believe you after 15 we have no confidence in you, but despite that because we respect the simple proportional representation, we love the simple proportional representation. Do we want simple proportional representation? We respect it and we will try to honour it. We will sit around a table with you in the run-up to the elections so that we have time to say: Mr Tsipras. Mr Stathakis, Mrs Katseli, you say protection of the main residence and we say it. Let us see exactly what we mean? What are you going to do? We have read their programme. Without having agreed beforehand, they put it out, so we had a workshop on our Odysseus plan to replace Hercules. A year and a half ago. We invited them to a workshop in the technopolis, at the gas station in Athens. They didn't come. They didn't even come to a workshop, if that's possible and even the META of the centre of post-capitalist culture, which is not even a day so that they are not exposed to be close to day 25, and they didn't come anyway, we read what they are saying now about the main house, they say we will do, we will issue, they say a legislative act, in which they say we will put a moratorium on auctions, they say for a few months and then what happens? We're going to have auctions all together. Because if you put them in if you abolish the auctions, the funds will go bankrupt. That's what we're going to do, we're going to abolish the auctions so that the funds will go bankrupt to abolish the Hercules market. That's a first time break.
