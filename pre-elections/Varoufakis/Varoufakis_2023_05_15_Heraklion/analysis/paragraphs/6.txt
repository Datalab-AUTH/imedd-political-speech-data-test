Internationalistically with our comrades in Latin America, President Lula of Brazil. The Communist Party of Cuba, with which Day 25 has been twinned a few months ago. The President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico, who has a message for you when we were in his office just before we left the Presidential Palace he says to me, you have elections with the day 25 do not put down this message to you to the people of Heraklion, as it was in Chania, as it was in Alexandroupolis, as it will be in Patras the day after tomorrow in Thessaloniki and in Athens. At European level yesterday our comrades, our fellow travellers, the day 25 Germany. Participated in the German elections in the state of Bremen. We got a small 2%, one and a half percent, but it is the first time that there is an internationalist movement which is not that it is a sister party. It's the same, with us we ran in Bremen and Heraklion at the same time. Think about it, when has this ever happened before? You have their greetings and love from Bremen and go on the Internet to see the messages. International level, internationalist struggle, pan-European level, European struggle, national level of course.
