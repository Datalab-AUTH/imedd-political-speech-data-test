Friends, fellow travellers, comrades of SYRIZA. Syriza. Did you see? Did you see what happens to a man if he is burned? Do you know what it means to have joined Syriza, to have believed in it, to have given your best? To have reached the point of trusting your comrades with your life. To enter the Eurogroup, to give to the fight for the good of all. And to realize that your own comrades go to Draghi and tell him don't listen to him, we'll work it out. I have my wounds like all of us, but now is the day of celebration because the no which has been in the parliament 4 years ago with the day 25 alliance for the break is gigantic and not only gigantic, but having proven. What left unity means in practice. What it means to be able to put aside any bitterness of the past, as we did on Day 25, with a number of left-wing non-aligned people with whom our paths had parted with Stathis Kouvelakis, Kostas Lapavitsas and people like Christos Laskos in Thessaloniki. Especially with the comrades of popular unity with the children of ARAS. What do we achieve from May 22nd? The foundation of the new great left of the new great selfless disobedient disobedient disobedient left, which has a governmental plan for all issues, not only for VAT, not only for the red loans which we will replace with consolidated deposits of our people who are currently humiliated by the services, humiliated by the funds with the public company for the management of red loans, Odysseus, not only will we abolish the Superfund and the public property will be transferred to become the capital base of a new development bank and at the same time a new agricultural bank, which was broken into pieces and given first to Sallas' Piraeus and then to John Paulson's Piraeus. Our policy on deliberative councils of conscripts and elected citizens so that we can answer the question of young people, because the question young people have been asking me for years is twofold.
