We are not going to fight over the legacy of Andreas Papandreou. We let Androulakis and Tsipras fight over the word change. Which of course they have added 2 letters before change. The only thing they care about is becoming ministers and prime ministers. We are here for the people, not the offices. We're here for rupture, not for change. We are here because with a break everything can be different. What we mean by everything can be different. Tomorrow morning a government of day 25 alliance for rupture now you will tell me what you are saying? Comrades comrades, fellow travellers. Raise the pace of hope of optimism, because all great things start from 3% from 4% from 5%. All great things, all that can be different starts on 21 May. It's not enough to say it, it's not enough to talk about the rupture. You have to have a government program. Is there another one that has a government program like that of the Day 25 coalition for the break?
