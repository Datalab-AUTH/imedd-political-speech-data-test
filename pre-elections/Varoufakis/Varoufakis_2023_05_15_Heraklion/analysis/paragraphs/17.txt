Young people come and say to me, John, who will protect us from capital? The answer is the state. The laws banning the hiring companies. And then they come up with the second question. And who will protect us from the state? The answer, the advisory councils of conscripts and elected citizens. Imagine a judiciary where supreme court justices are not appointed by the prime minister. They are not appointed by other supreme judges, but by an advisory council of clerical judges of all ranks from the lowest to the highest. Imagine a single public utility. Which is socialized because the Board of Directors is appointed by an advisory council of clerks and elected citizens. Imagine a Greek Railway Organisation. Preventing the crime of Tempi, which was the result of the breaking of the infrastructure on the one hand and the trains on the other and the privatisation of the one by a bankrupt Italian state and the other by a failed Greek state, the creation of a public railway organisation that should come to Crete to build a state-of-the-art high-speed railway from Chania to Sitia. This will create jobs. That means a green transition. This means technology transfer to Crete, not the pharaonic motorways and the castle that destroys an entire region, so that when I come from Athens to Heraklion it takes me half an hour an hour longer to get there this is progress only for the predators of SYRIZA to eat the predators of New Democracy to eat the predators of PASOK, to eat the predators of local government, which has been reduced to what it has been reduced to, we will talk about them after the elections before the local elections in October. The last time she was here we went to Arkalochori, where we learned that 22 houses that were crumbling because of the earthquake had been targeted by an Irish fund based in Cayman Island.
