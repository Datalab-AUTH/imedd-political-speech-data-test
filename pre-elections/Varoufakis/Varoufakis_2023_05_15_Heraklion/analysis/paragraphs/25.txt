We did not mince our words then or now, but at the same time we will not agree with NATO's stance, which is war for ever until the last ounce of the Ukrainian people in favour of a NATO framework aimed at maintaining Europe's dependence. Because the war in Ukraine is of no concern to the Americans. Do you know what they do care? That the European Union does not exist. There is no European Union. Imagine for a moment that a peace process is starting, I wish I could knock on wood. We know that Zelensky will represent Ukraine. Putin in Moscow. Biden, if he's alive by then, will represent the United States of America. The European Union, who will represent it? There are the Poles or the Estonians, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Finns, the Swedes and the Danes do not want Solts and Macron. Veto got Solts and Macron out of the way. And who will the Estonian go? We don't even know his name he doesn't have one. What will he put us in one in a war process? All the rest of the Europeans? The European Union has abolished itself. I mentioned Gandhi before whenever I am asked my opinion about the European Union, you know, I tell them? I remember something Gandhi said when he was asked. What is your opinion, Mr Gandhi, of British, of British culture, of British civilisation, of British culture? India was then under the British Empire. So they asked him what was your view of British civilization? British civilization. And Gandhi turns around with his very nice English accent and says. It would be a very, very good idea.
