And since they were talking about her, even the British Empire never thought of doing that with India, when it was a colony of India. We are not just a colony.

It is no coincidence that Skurchos comes out and says slowly now that we will continue to claim German reparations, of course put on a German uniform Mr Skurchos and say it with a German accent pesto and German to be more understandable to your audience, which of course is not in Greece, it is in Berlin. I wonder Mr Tsipras when he went to get the anointing from Mr Solts of recently to say afterwards what are you talking about partnerships with Baroufakis and Day 25 alliance for the break. I went to Solts when you went to Solts Mr. Tsipras, did you say anything to him about German reparations? You want to bet he didn't say a word? All he asked for was the holy water. From Olaf Scholz or from a man who represents a historical social democratic party which has ceased to be social democratic since the 1990s, which is responsible for the plundering of the German proletariat, as a result of the policies. You know, austerity was not brought to Germany by Merkel and Schäuble, it was brought by Steinmeier, it was brought by the Social Democrats, by Schröder before them and then by Steinmeier. This social democratic party, that is, the PASOK of Germany, because who also tied us hand and foot to the Memoranda, Mr Androulakis, if Andreas Papandreou sees you from where he is, he is cursing you as we speak.
