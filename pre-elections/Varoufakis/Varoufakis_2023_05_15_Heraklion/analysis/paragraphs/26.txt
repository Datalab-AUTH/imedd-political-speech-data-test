That's how I think about the European Union, when they say what is your view of the European Union? We are internationalists. It would be a great idea, we don't have a European Union, we have a cartel of big business, banks, loan sharks, oligarchs, who are squeezing every single people in the European Union into austerity brought to us as a dress rehearsal to go to Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Italy, France and eventually Germany. These are complicated things, because the journalists of the establishment and unfortunately the rest of the left say to you, are you for or against the European Union? Are you with Putin, are you with NATO? I am not with anybody. I am with no one with the people of Ukraine or with the people of Russia or with the people of Germany. I am with the people of Nigeria and the people of Greece and Putin and NATO are the same syndicate, as we used to say about the EEC and NATO. And you know what? I think our people have the acumen and the experience. And the historical knowledge to understand that and you will see that.
