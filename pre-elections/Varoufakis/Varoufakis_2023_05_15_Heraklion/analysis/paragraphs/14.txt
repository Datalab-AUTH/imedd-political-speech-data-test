He said another euphemism of Mr Skertzos and Mr Mitsotakis. Because he says you're not going, he says all the parties should take our programmes to the general accounting office of the state, to the Bank of Greece, that is, to the Troika. To cost us. Look, we are philanthropists. We will not do that to them, because if we take our economic and social programme to the Bank of Greece, people will have a stroke. We don't want them to die suddenly. So because with the NHS, the way they've got it, they may not have the health care they should have. Why would they have a stroke? They'll see the first thing we're going to do is introduce Demetra which is a digital transaction system that saves you 2 billion a year in fees that bankers won't get, is that going to be priced by Bank of Greece? He doesn't dare do it, they'll fire John Paulson who has taken over Piraeus because who do you think the Bank of Greece bosses are? Frankfurt and common criminal law types like John Paulson will cut their salaries. The foreign exchange, as we used to say as students abroad. Where we talk about the energy exchange, you know that in 2022 alone the Mitsotakis government borrowed five and a half billion five and a half billion to give the subsidy to Vardinoyannis, to Latsis to Peristeri, to Mytilineos, to CVC, five and a half billion, you know what five and a half billion is, it's a lot of numbers.
