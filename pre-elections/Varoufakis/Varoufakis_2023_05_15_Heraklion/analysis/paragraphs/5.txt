And we come from then to today. Today we are no longer day 25 alone. We have proved what a Unitary Front, a front of the militant Non-Resistance Non-Subversive Left, means. I want to greet the comrades of the Popular Unity who are with us today. I want to bow to the children of ARAS. For winning a proud victory in the student elections, not for us, for you. Because you put your chest forward. To the university police. To the autocracy of the big factions inside the universities, who want to play political games, party games at the expense of the students. You have shown the way to us. We are here to support you and I am very happy to see you here tonight. Because the fight, friends, is a tough one. And we are fighting it on many levels.
