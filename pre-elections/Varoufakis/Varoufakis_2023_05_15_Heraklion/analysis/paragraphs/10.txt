But they don't just stall on these. The other day in Kypseli in Athens. The great Mr Mitsotakis was there with his cortege of policemen, his guard. And two things happened. The first is that a comrade of ours, Dimitris, a member of Popular Unity and of course of the Mera 25 alliance for rupture, went to the Mera 25 alliance for rupture stand and Mitsotakis' henchmen threw him against the railings, trampled him and then had a plainclothes policeman arrest him and take him to the police station. At the same time, Mr Mitsotakis walked past the PASOK SYRIZA election booths, greeted them very civilized in that nice style. So they all greeted him and then he goes to the Mera 25 booth. And that's where our comrade put the glasses on me. Allow me a self-criticism. Because of my urban residue, I would have shaken his hand. I would do it with a cold heart, but I would do it, I would shake his hand. The comrade, he didn't shake his hand. I take my hat off to her because she put the glasses on me. Good for her. It's very important that we evolve together. And I close the reference to Mahatma Gandhi said first you are ignored then you are vilified then you are distorted then you are bullied at some point you win, but to win you need a break.
