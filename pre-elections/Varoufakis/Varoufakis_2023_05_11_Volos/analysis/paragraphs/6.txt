Any German banks when you have an economy like Germany, which constantly. It has a trade surplus, meaning it sells more abroad than it buys from abroad, it raises money, the money goes into the banks. The banker's nightmare, you know what it is? Having a lot of deposits and not being able to lend them out. Money stagnating in a bank's drawers is the nightmare on the table. The German didn't want to borrow because he had a good salary, he had saved himself. She says to you, why should I borrow from the banker? But you in Greece want washing machines and refrigerators, you want cars, you want to go on holiday? You remember the mortgages, some of you, and you have collateral. He explained to me that until you entered the euro we were scared, we were afraid to lend you money because you had drachmas. Any drachmas kept slipping in value, so what are we going to give you marks and you give us drachmas that are losing value? We were afraid to lend you. But now that you're going into the markka, do you get it? The way he said it and Schaeuble said it once, he missed it once, he said to me once, can't the Germans have the mark or can't the French have the mark and expect to control their budget? He missed it instead of saying. The euro came out of the mark, didn't it? It's no coincidence that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt is next door to Deutsche Bank. Anyway, I'm closing the parenthesis. I won't bore you too much with this, but to understand where why we are where we are. We are where we are here because? What Franz told me has come true.
