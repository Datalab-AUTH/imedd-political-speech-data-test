One of the great crimes and I'll end with this so I won't bore you so I can stay. We'll be back here and hopefully in the square outside; one of the great crimes. Of this government, especially Mitsotakis S.A. is that they have alienated the Greeks from the idea. Of the green transition. When they come. And they bring you a wind turbine of obsolete fifteen year old second hand technology that we ripped out of a plain in Germany where it worked just fine. Because if you've ever seen the plains of Germany, they're endless endless flat. Geographical areas and they have big big farms that are parallelograms and in every corner they have a huge wind turbine. Platinum flats are 150 meters that spin and order power just fine. It's for the Germans then. But when? These are old. They uproot them, they send them to Lavrion. Anyone who goes to Lavrion will see them. They're spread out there. A whole area in Lavrion is all these second-hand large wind turbines that are also made of fiberglass. They are not recyclable. So what do they do instead of putting it we don't have plains, only the Thessalian plain we have this so. Instead of here they put them on the mountain tops. So you've destroyed the whole mountain. You have destroyed the whole mountain and you have put a huge wind turbine on top of it and you look at it as if it were the statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro. So it turns your bokku destroys your environment, it destroys the mountain the paths of the archaeological sites and it belonged to the copilot or the pigeon, who takes all the energy. And what do you take not to say? Nothing nothing nothing the destruction takes you,
