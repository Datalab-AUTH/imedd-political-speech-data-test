The next stage is what we have experienced here. In the year 2000 with the creation of the eurozone. I've told the story before. We allowed the other time I like to tell it because it happened to open my eyes. A high-ranking CEO was not a CEO, he was on the board of Deutsche Bank with whom I had good luck, bad luck. You would judge sitting next to a plane in his seat going to America 8 hours some time talking. So we got chatting back then it wasn't 2000 it was 1998 we had already locked ourselves into the Eurozone. We hadn't entered the euro yet the euro hadn't been created yet, but we had locked in the exchange rates. Basically we were in the euro and I said to him, "No, Franz, I said why have you? Such excitement about Greece joining the eurozone. What do you have to gain from us in the eurozone? You tell me, because one thing we leftists say, another thing we tell you. The director, one of the directors of Deutsche Bank. And he says to me: "You are our dream, you are our dream, explain to me why we are our dream, what do we produce that you want from us, thinking a little old imperialistically, we don't even have gold. It wasn't so much the markets sell to us within them was that too. You know what he said to me? It tells me the average Greek. He is the ideal client of Deutsche Bank, why? He owns his house. And he had no debt. You own a house and you don't have a credit card, he doesn't have a mortgage, he doesn't owe anybody, you might not have a lot of money. You may not have a house in the millions, but you have a salary, you have an income, you have a house which is collateral to get loans or what was Deutsche Bank's problem?
