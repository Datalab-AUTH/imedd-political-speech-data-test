2 looting mechanisms, red loans, stock market energy go to the third banks and super fund, combination. The Super Fund. Please spread this around, check the first one already, lest I am not telling you the truth. The super fund we have in Greece does not exist anywhere else in the world. For the demitra I am told, Mr Varoufakis, that the demitra has been implemented nowhere at the moment. It is an innovative idea for a country that needs it more than any other. But don't they have a problem with innovation? It is not their problem. But if it hasn't been done here or anywhere else, why should it be done here? They don't tell you that, because the Hyperfund was only made here. With the superfund they don't have an innovation problem. What is a superfund? Have you understood anything? We created a superfund, that's what they call it, in which we put all the public property that was left, that is, that was not sold off, into the superfund and into the superfund. But come on it's not public on paper it's public. Do you know that? Do the lenders control who the president is? And another board member and the President and that board member that the lenders put in have a veto. In other words, the lenders have the power, so we're the only country on the planet. Act please somebody. Let me be proven wrong, we are the only country on the planet where public property is officially controlled by foreign powers by an act of the Greek Parliament passed by Syriza. Understand what avant-garde Tsipras gave Mitsotakis when the Left has passed all this. The right is rejoicing, laughing; when all this was done with a left-wing progressive bias that speaks of progressive governance.
