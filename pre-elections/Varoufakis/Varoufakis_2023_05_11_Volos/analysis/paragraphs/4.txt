Allow me. Since we're kind of an amphitheatre, I wouldn't say this if we were in the square, but you'll forgive me now, I saw an amphitheatre and it came to me like this. At one time imperialism, imperialism was a very primitive and simple process; go the conquistador troops, for example in Latin America They were taking the gold to Spain, the ancient Athenians were going to get silver, they brought it, it went to Delos, right? With capitalism it becomes more sophisticated. Luxemburg theory, Lenin theory, simple stuff. When you have in the center the metropolis of capitalism you have productive forces of capitalism. Factories that produce things in such large quantities and so efficiently that the local markets can't assimilate because the wages of the workers so the profits of the capitalists are too high, the wages are too low and you have a system that produces more goods than it can assimilate. So what does it do? It has to find markets. And you have imperialism, they occupy countries to occupy their markets, to find buyers on the periphery, for the goods produced in the metropolis. Classical theory Marxist theory of imperialism, Lenin. This second stage, containment. The first is the primitive, the second capitalist nice.
