In this election? The stakes are one. The Greek people are asked to either accept. That within this straitjacket. The memoranda with the predatory funds with the stock exchanges, actions with the yes to everything on photovoltaics, in the fields and second hand wind turbines on the mountain tops. Within this framework, literary things can be done. Anyone who believes this, don't vote for MERA 25 Alliance for Rupture . We do not believe that this can be done. We believe that this country is becoming deserted. Both its people and its nature are being plundered so we need a break.That's why we are here. I want to thank you once again, especially to our candidates. We have great struggle or demonization, it is systematic. May I ask you to come one more time? Come the candidates and candidates, why are these people here? Run our race in the last ten days, which is crucial. But this election will not produce a government. They will make it clear to the nation and not to say outside that the MERA 25 alliance for rupture is here to stay and is here to create the conditions, the yeast, for the great party of the militant left. Thank you very much.
