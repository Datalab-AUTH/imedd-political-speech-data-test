The AADE is another dream of the memoranda, you know, the AADE, the tax office, the independent public revenue authority is very dependent on them, it belongs to the Troika like the Hyperfund. You know of no other country where the tax authorities are owned by foreign powers.I will say it once again, this was not true even under German occupation. Yes, they went into the Central Bank and they passed. That's how the Wehrmacht generals got loans, but let them get the idea of taking over the tax offices. They didn't think of that, they weren't that advanced, they're going to get hit now, that is, if they exist and they see us from somewhere, that is, Hitler himself will say what an idiot I was for sending Wehrmacht. We were getting killed and the others sent the troika and got out of trouble. With a real occupation in perpetuity with an entire political system of Greeks defending it.
