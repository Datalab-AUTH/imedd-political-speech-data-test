And we are entering the third and poisonous memorandum of 2015 and the even more poisonous one of summer 2018, which Mr Tsipras called the exit from the memorandum. The worst just look to see why it matters; this mnemonic process under Syriza. Because for the first time a form of imperialism is being created that has never existed anywhere in the world. The previous ones I gave you the example, you know? What is happening today is unique; they built the Hercules market. In which they buy and sell the red loans of the world. With the guarantee of the Greek government do you know that we have guaranteed 23 billion minimum profits to the predatory funds? If at this moment the predatory funds do not make 23 billion minimum profit, we will give it to them from where? Let me give you an order of things. An order of magnitude.For education we give 5 muscles. Every year for health we give so five and a half 6 total, we give 11 education and health 23 we will owe the funds to make it to Cayman Islands. So when a river comes in and takes your 100,000 loan away for 3 grand. And he puts his house on the market for 50, he's got three. And he's got 47. Direct foreign investment, Kyriakos Mitsotakis celebrates the 3 that went in he says nothing about the 47 that goes to the Cayman Islands, because this is not only a destruction of the Social Web to throw people out of their homes to close their shops to create unemployment when you close a shop because of a foreclosure. That's not all, not that there's little of that. It's that 70 billion is going to go to Kaman Island from this broken country. That's an imaginative form of capitalism, imperialism. It hasn't existed anywhere else.
