I'd like to before. Expand on them. Because, just as the personal is political, so the local is international and the international is local. I would like to greet. Our candidates, our nominees all of you who really adorned our constituency ballot here. I will start alphabetically so tradition says George Valamoutopoulos, Dimitris Kanellis, Agapi Karamanlis. Katerina Balla is not here, she is in Germany. She sends us her love and the solidarity of Germany. She will be here soon. Charalambos Pephanis. Faye Janetoulakou. And of course Vassilis Psathas our great moment Vassilis. We have a strong constituency in our region, we have people who have bled to prevent looting. Congratulations on your struggles. We are honored that the movements that you are part of.have responded to the call of Day 25 because perhaps the biggest move we have ever made since we entered the House was after the first Day 25 consultative conference to open our arms, our doors, our soul to movements like yours to independent people on the left, in the intelligentsia, in trade unionism, in labour and of course in the popular unity with which we have been reunited after a few years of divergence. These elections are only an intermediate stage towards the creation of a truly great militant left, a party that will claim power to give it to society immediately afterwards through consultative councils of conscripts and elected citizens through the opposite of what other parties are asking for, we are not asking for a mandate from you, we are only asking for a mandate from you. An opportunity to break down the barriers to cut the thin thread of plunder and give power to the neighborhoods, the communities, the movements. We have a great struggle ahead of us. Thank you. Let's say a few more words and then we'll come back to take the pictures and continue.
