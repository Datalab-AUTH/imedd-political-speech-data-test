Did you see them yesterday? How sullenly they supported the Memorandum regime as reasonable. And. As the only alternative you saw in the debate. Do you dare tell them any of what I'm telling you what they are? What are they? Why is it the political staff? Of the oligarchy. It's no coincidence that.Michael Kritharides, yesterday let's say he got a phone call just before moving to go to the Mega studio. From Mega we do not want you, do not come, dropped marinakis order never to appear man of day 25 alliance for the break. Because because we told the truth about him, about Alafuso, that on the one hand they have their channels of disaster with which they infect anyone to talk about a peace process in Ukraine, despite the fact that we have been the first to condemn Putin, but we say this war can not have winners. Let us have a peace process, we are slandered by the Marinakis, Alafoussos and other channels as Poutine. While the tankers of Alafouzos and Vardinoyannis and Marinakis are carrying Putin's oil. And they are suing Kleon. And we're not being played on their channels, look at them, this is a matter of democracy. So there is an electoral law that forces them to take us out. The law is Marinakis is Alafuso. It's Vardinoyannis and Mytilineos. That is what we have come to. So the plundering of people and nature is a given.
