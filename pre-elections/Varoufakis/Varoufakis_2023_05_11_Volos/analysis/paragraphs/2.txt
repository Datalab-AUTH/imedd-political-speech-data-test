Are we going to tell all this? I want to say hello. All of you, all of you. Basically, I want to greet the Volos of the movements, the disobedient, disobedient Volos that does not give up either to the plundering of people or the plundering of nature. Nor to autocracy. Of the mayor. Of the overall political situation, which has brought this place to the brink of serfdom, debt serfdom, debt serfdom, false green transition that gives green transition a bad name, bank serfdom, fund serfdom of all those who unravel a thin thread of plunder that runs through everything from colleges. The clinics, the funds; the garbage burning, the water, the electricity, everything is tied up in this fine thread of plunder and we in the 25 day alliance for rupture are here to cut that thread. It's easy. As long as we do it.
