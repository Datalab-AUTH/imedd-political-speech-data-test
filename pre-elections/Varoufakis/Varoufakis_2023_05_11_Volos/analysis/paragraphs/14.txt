And I'll come to the hangman now. As we speak, if you're a small businessman, there's no chance of getting a loan. For your business, none. If you're an oligarch, that is following the banks, a simple slow start, we don't give money to anybody who needed it. This is the bankers' principle of only giving more to those who have it. So, in other words, there is no investment flow of investment money that can help the development of even rudimentary growth of small and medium enterprises. At the same time. You have banks whose shares you see going up, despite the fact that they are bankrupt how can our banks be bankrupt, as I say, and their shares go up I tell you; why? The big black holes in their books, which are real, are covered by the European Central Bank with the troika telling them, don't worry here we are. But at the same time when you have 1000 â‚¬ in the bank. What interest rate gives you 0.04. If you borrow 1,000 euros, what interest rate does it give you, 8. That's called usury. We used to call it that, so they used to write Dostoevsky novels about this usury. That's our banking system. When I said in an article, we have to blow up the banking system. That's what I meant by this system of plunder. It has to be blown up. Varoufakis will take your deposits, who will take your deposits? 7 out of 10 Greeks have no deposits because the troika took them away, austerity took them away, suddenly they are being seized every day, they are seizing unseized accounts.
