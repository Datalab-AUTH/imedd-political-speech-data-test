I said, "No, you're not telling me it's going to be a scoop loan.Like they used to do, remember in the early 2000s, credit cards would come in the mail that you hadn't applied for and they were activated. You went and shopped. This has never been done in any other country in the world. I don't know of any other country that has done that, giving you a credit card without asking for it. Usually you have to beg to fill out forms, remember what used to happen? That was France's policy. And I say to him you don't tell me when it's okay we're going to get all these loans it's going to create a semblance of growth because when all this money is circulating, that's how everybody feels richer. House prices go up when you give mortgages to people and they can go and they go and knock instead of giving 50,000, they give 80,000 because they've got a 20,000 mortgage loan is that inside everybody feels like it's affordable houses, they say, you know how much your house is going from where you were selling it, 80 tops, now from selling it 200 it's saying oh well I've got 200.000 covets in the house takes and a credit card at the time I have a guarantee from Deutsche Bank, which of course was not the National Bank itself it was Eurobank and so on so I say to him you don't tell me when this bubble bursts and this debt is unbearable and people can pay it. What are you going to do? He was saying they're going to take their houses away. Did you see where we are? This is the third form of imperialism. That neither with the Wehrmacht army or the conquistadors of Spain nor do they come here to find so much purchase, they come here to lend you money; they are the battering ram of debt. And then when it bursts. They come and take your houses.
