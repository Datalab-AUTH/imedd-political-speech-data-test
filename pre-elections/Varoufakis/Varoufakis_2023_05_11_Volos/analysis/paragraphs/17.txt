What do we say?Let me answer. Let me answer. To this rhetorical question, with a reference to something Alexis Tsipras said in the debate, at some point? At some point he threw out a line that what is needed for the left, you heard it, is unity. We agree. But unity to do what? The answer. It's clear; it's to do nothing. Because what we have been saying for two years now is that we have been calling all the progressive parties that call themselves progressive. Come to talk, come to have a discussion without necessarily meeting, to discuss. What do you say about the red loans? Do you? To not have them to put a brake on the auctions promised, he says he will cancel the auctions. For how long? The funds that come in and buy up the red loans. So they have guarantees 23 billion from us if they are banned in the auctions they won't get out, so we're going, what do we get? We go to Lagarde to borrow 23 billion to give to the funds because we will have stopped the auctions, things are simple. If we were sitting around a table, we'd say to our SYRIZA friends, guys, we can't stop the auctions; unless you want to give 23 billion of the money we don't have in the coffers to go to the Cayman Islands, in which case. Either we abolish Hercules. Along with this 23 billion guarantee we're going to legislate to abolish it? We don't owe you any more because no parliament can. To bind a next Parliament? A basic principle of democracy. And do we protect the main house and the small business or can we not protect them? Should we let them do the auctions to get the 23 billion? Or should we give it to them? The 23 billion, well, that's the discussion we wanted to have and to forge a unity on the basis of a common solution.
