And now we're coming. To the first memoranda. What were the first memoranda? They weren't in solidarity with Greece, they were in solidarity with Deutsche Bank, because it had gone bankrupt because of stupid, stupid positions it had made in the US market. Let's not get into the process now. And when there was a possibility that the Greek government might not be able to repay its debts to Deutsche Bank and along with the Greek government and individuals. He panicked; the decision makers in Berlin and he says to you. We will give them 110 billion to give to Deutsche Bank. The first memorandum went completely to the French and German banks. It was a bailout, not of Greece, which Papandreou says saved us, but of the French and German banks. That was the first memorandum and the second memorandum saved the Greek bankers, not the banks. And this is the primitive. So the bankers have always done that. They would give money to the bankrupt client to give it back to the client to cover up their bankruptcy for the bankers.
