We don't mind that, it's an inter-memorial conflict between them, because we will never form a government with them? Why not to abolish the energy exchange not to abolish Hercules not to abolish the Super Fund not to abolish tax prepayments. To keep building to have mining and gas pipelines from Israel under the apron of Turkey to Crete. What Tsipras voted for in the arms of the murderer Netanyahu, the most brutal Prime Minister who has gone from the apartheid state to Israel in the arms of our comrade Alexis with him. Well we would never enter a coalition government like that. Especially when they closed the door to dialogue. The demitra allowed us not to have to say it and say it again because fortunately the right and the far right imposed two things on Tsipras to disavow us and embrace the far right narrative example that I was recording the Eurogroup. As if we didn't do it with Alexis then as if my goal was not one. To keep minutes that were not kept so that we could prove what was being said in there that was completely different from what was being said on the cameras outside. As if together we were not proud of the fact that we were showing the European citizens, the Germans, the Dutch, the French. What was going on in the Eurogroup that the Eurogroup did not keep a record that things were being done in there against the citizens of the whole of Europe in the name of the citizens of Europe, they made him apologise and sign it. A statement of repentance for that fine struggle of those months. We will say no more. We are sad that people with whom we have been together for even 5 minutes. To make this moral and political slide.
