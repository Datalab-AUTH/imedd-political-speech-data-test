IOU's are. They had a problem when the IOU's were for the Greek people's resistance to the Troika, but now they're using them just fine, they have no problem when it comes to subsidies for the greed, the obscenity, the austerity called inflation, subsidies for their own shareholders, see bosses. Friends, get ready for an escalation of black propaganda and scaremongering. For fake news that would make Donald Trump blush. The scaremongering of the right and the establishment has been constant for decades. They used to say, "People, don't vote for them, they're communists, they'll take your houses.". Now that the houses are being taken by their own people, the funds, they don't talk about them. In the house of the hanged man, they don't talk about funds. Now they have a new scare story, you've heard it in the last few days: "people, the MP25 will close your banks". Who says that? Those who dare to talk about closing banks are those who, when we became government in 2015, did everything to close the banks. Do you remember December 2014? One month before the January 2015 elections. Stournaras started the bank run by predicting, by implication, that there would be a liquidity problem in the market. This has never been done before in the history of capitalism by a central banker, i.e. to come out and predict a problem. His job is to make sure there is no problem. It's there so there's no problem.
