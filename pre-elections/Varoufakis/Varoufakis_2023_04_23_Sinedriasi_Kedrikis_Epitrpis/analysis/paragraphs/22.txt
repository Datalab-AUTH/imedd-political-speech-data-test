In conclusion, let me come to the European profile of MERA25.
We started in Berlin in February 2016 as a pan-European movement.
We built a movement in which we are all members without having a Greek part a German part a French part an Italian part and even a British part.
We are all members of diem25
Those of us who are running in the elections of the derm25, those of us who are members of the derm25, we are an integral part of the only pan-European European, internationalist patriotic movement.
No one will lecture us on what a European profile means.
We are being told: but you are going against Europe. There have always been two Europes as fellow travellers. There was the Europe of Metternich and the Europe of Lord Byron and the Philhellenes.
