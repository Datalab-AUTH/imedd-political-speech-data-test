I don't know if you read it: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and some other countries, and Slovakia if I'm not mistaken, have banned the import of grain from Ukraine, which is their biggest favourite with Zelensky against Putin ... Why? Because their farmers are being destroyed. With all the volume of agricultural products being shipped from Ukraine to Poland the Polish farmers are finished. You will see.
