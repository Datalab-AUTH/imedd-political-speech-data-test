I grew up in a Greek capitalism with the drachma, it was not socialism.
Changing the currency makes no difference. The currency should be the servant of the people, not the people the servants of the currency.
We don't want the drachma there is a cost to leaving the euro, but we will not sacrifice the future for a euro that is used to achieve what the Wehrmacht failed to achieve.
We will not do them the favor of leaving the European Union ever! if we have to go back to our own currency we will create a national currency.
