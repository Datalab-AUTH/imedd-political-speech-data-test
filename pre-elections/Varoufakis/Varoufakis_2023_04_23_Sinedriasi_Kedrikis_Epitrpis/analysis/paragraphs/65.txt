are you teaching us a lesson who? the ones who threw 62% of the will of the people that night into the wastebasket? are they going to teach us a lesson in popular will?  Listen to what they are telling us: they are telling us that you are addressing the Greek people and asking for the vote of the citizens to break with the oligarchy, to abolish the energy exchange, to abolish Herakli, to reduce VAT, to abolish mining, to break the agreement between Greece and Israel with the despicable Mr. Detanyahu, you give this perspective to the people and you ask for a vote for it, take that vote and then betray that vote and join us who have guaranteed the oligarchy that we will not do any of this.So, make me prime minister again, says a gentleman, so that I don't do what MERA25 says. They consider this to be respect for the will of the people. They weren't slaughtered.
