Surplus says. The Greek government has a surplus again. That's good in theory, isn't it? No, it's not nice. It's good not to have a deficit. Especially in a state that is bankrupt. Not having to borrow to pay salaries and pensions. That's good. A surplus is not good. If we had a kiosk, a business, a family, a surplus is good, it means you're making a profit or putting something aside. But when you are a state and you have a surplus it means a deficit for the people. Because if the state has a surplus of one euro, it means that it took it from the people and did not use it for public health or education, but gave it to the Troika and the lenders, or borrowed it to give benefits to Mytilineos, Latsis, Vardinoyannis, through the energy exchange, with all these IOUs called passes. The market pass, the fuel pass, what are they all? They had a problem when the IOU's were for the Greek people's resistance to the Troika, but now they use them just fine, they have no problem when it comes to subsidies of price, of obscenity, of austerity called inflation, of subsidies to their own shareholders, see bosses.
