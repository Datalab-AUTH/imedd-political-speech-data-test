Macquarie has a long tradition of looting and criminal moves against former public bodies. In particular, this Macquarie bought the London Water Company a few years ago. It paid out GBP 5 billion, of which it borrowed GBP 3 billion and loaded it onto the company it bought. It's like me coming to your house to get it and borrowing from you to get it. And after they did that do you know what else Macquarie did? They took another 8 billion in loans, put it on the backs of the water company and finally put it in their pockets. These gentlemen own the DPA. Do you know what the DEDDEO will do with the help of the RAE and Mitsotakis SA from 1 May, but retroactively from 1 January? It will increase the unit fixed charge for our homes and shops from 52 cents a kilowatt hour to EUR 4.4. That is an increase of 752%.
