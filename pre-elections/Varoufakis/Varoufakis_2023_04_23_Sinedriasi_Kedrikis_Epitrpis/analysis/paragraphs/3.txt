The messages, fellow comrades, compa√±eras, comrades, friends from all over Greece are overwhelming from Nea Smyrni, from Rhodes, where we were yesterday, from Thessaloniki, from all corners of Greece, from a world that had been defeated, a world that felt wounded, that hid in its shell after the capitulation of 2015, that magnificent world of no,   has been reinvigorated, even people who do not follow MP25, even people who do not follow Popular Unity, who are not in the groups and movements that have joined the Alliance for Rupture, they see people who are putting aside their egos, they see people who are creating a frontal united movement and they are reinvigorated and coming to our ranks. 
Some more bravely, some more timidly, some less sceptical, some more sceptical, but little by little they are coming and that is how the great militant Left that was so lacking in this country is being built and will continue to be built after the elections. For this reason, and I think that this is something very positive that we should applaud and embrace and that will give us great joy and satisfaction. The black propaganda of the system against us has started again; we rejoice in it, we love their hatred and their lies, because it means that we are doing something good.
