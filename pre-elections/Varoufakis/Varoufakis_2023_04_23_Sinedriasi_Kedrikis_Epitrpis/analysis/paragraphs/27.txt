But we will never leave the European Union! let them leave.
One last word about Europeanism. We, the Left, know what patriotism means. What does patriotism mean? To say yes to everything in the government, whatever it is? The junta? Karamanlis? Simitis? No. Patriotism for us, the left-wing Greeks, the patriots of this country, is to be out there, to protest, to demonstrate against our governments. That is patriotism. The same applies to our Europeanism. Do you know what Europeanism means? Not saying 'yes to everything and 'vasta Geroun', but going against the directorates and the troikas that are destroying Europe. Because this establishment, which every Europeanist progressive must come to direct support and confront, this establishment in the name of Europe is systematically dividing Europeans.
