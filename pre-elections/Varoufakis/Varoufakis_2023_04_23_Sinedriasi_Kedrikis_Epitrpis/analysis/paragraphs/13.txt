The first lie, and it's very topical these days, if we continue to say yes to everything, is that people's deposits in Eurobank, Alpha, Piraeus banks are secure. Ladies and gentlemen, fellow travellers, Greek people, if you are listening to us out there, your deposits are not guaranteed. There is no bank that is safe in the whole world. Think of Credit Suisse. If that was not safe and it collapsed, if Lehman Brothers in 2008 was unsafe and it collapsed, Piraeus, Ethniki, is not safe. They need a preparation to become safe, they need tools that do not exist in the Greek state. What the Swiss state did. A combination of a state with deep pockets and a central bank that has a printer that prints Swiss francs. And they printed tens of billions to calm down the Swiss banking system, that's what the Greek government wants to do, but can't. First, it can't borrow billions already it's bankrupt and second it doesn't have printers to print Euros. Which means what: the only way to make deposits safe is to abolish the monopoly that banks have on the payment system and the savings system. Example: with digital accounts of absolute security provided by the central bank. This is what the phrase I used in an article recently, which the system's trolls are excited to use to demonize us, and me in particular, "Blowing up the banking system" means. It means taking away their monopoly over the payment system, to get a coffee today with your plastic card you have to go through a mainstream bank. That's the end of the monopoly, we have digital systems. Mr. Pierrakakis could build such a platform, we would build it better of course, he could take the payment and savings system out of the banking system so that the savings of the citizens are not at risk at all. That is one lie. That if we're nice guys, savings are safe. They are not.
