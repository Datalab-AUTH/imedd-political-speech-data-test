Friends, get ready for an escalation of black propaganda and scaremongering. For fake news that would make Donald Trump blush. The scaremongering of the right and the establishment is tried and true, and has been for decades. They used to say "people don't vote for them, they're communists, they'll take your houses." Now that the houses are being taken away by their own people, the funds, they don't talk about them. In the house of the hanged man, they don't talk about funds. Now they have a new scaremongering, you will have heard it in the last few days: "people, the MP25 will close your banks". Who is saying this? They dare to talk about closing banks by those who, when we became government in 2015, did everything to close the banks. Remember December 2014? A month before the January 2015 elections. Stournaras started the bank run by predicting, unintentionally, that there would be a liquidity problem in the market. This has never been done before in the history of capitalism by a central banker, i.e. to come out and predict a problem. His job is to make sure there is no problem. He is there to make sure there is no problem. He's like the fireman who walks into a theater full of people and starts yelling "run because we're burning!" If the fireman tells you that, imagine what's going to happen. That's how Stournaras did the bank run. And then remember Mr. Georgiades and others coming out and advising people to pull their money out of the banks to bolster the bank run? They were begging the vasta Gerouns to beg Draghi to close our banks so that a government that dared to say No to the privatization of everything for even 15 minutes could fall. No to the abolition of the social security system. No to 24% VAT.
