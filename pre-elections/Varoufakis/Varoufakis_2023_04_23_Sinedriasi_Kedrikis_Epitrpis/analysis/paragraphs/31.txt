 No longer North-South but East-West. That's the nature of cartel Europe, because the European Union is a cartel Europe. We will not leave any European Union. We will blow up their cartels and through creative constructive disobedience we will veto all that divides Europeans. Because that's how they work, they divide to steal from us. I was just listening to a fellow MP25 member what she faced, a few weeks ago, a young mother and her husband, they wanted to buy a house. They found an apartment they took out a limp-dick loan to buy it. They found out that this apartment came from an auction. Did you see how they divide the Greeks? What can you tell them? Don't take a house? Someone will take it. It's the basic strategy of an establishment that can't even reproduce itself, not even in classical capitalist forms. So we are the rest, we are the patriots. We are Europeanists. And since we are talking about Europeanism, patriotism, rupture and struggle, it is not only us, you know, who are fighting this struggle. It is also our comrades of Merra25 Germany who are running at the moment in the state elections in Bremen. They are out there, the Germans.
