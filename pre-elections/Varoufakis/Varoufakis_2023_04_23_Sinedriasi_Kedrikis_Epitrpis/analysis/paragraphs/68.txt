The seven thousand Germans who at the same time surrounded the European Central Bank building in Frankfurt demanding that Draghi listen to the proposals of the Greek government.This is Europeanism! This is the European profile, this is the Europe for which we are striving!And for this Europe we are making a break, not with Europe, but against those who are destroying Europe.Those who, knowing only too well what they did in Maastricht in 1992, created a euro, a currency that was built, my friends, fellow travellers, comrades, built the euro as an apartment building with many apartments, penthouse, first floor, basement, class stratified of course, but an apartment building with no windows and no fire exits. And then they set it on fire, the penthouse bankers, the bankers, all those who drove European capitalism over the cliffs, the banking global crisis of 2007-2008, Deutche bank, Finanz bank, Societe general, BNP Paribas, they basically built the Eurozone apartment building, with no windows and no fire exits, they set the penthouse bankers on fire in the lower apartments, that was austerity, that was privatisations, that was the troikas.And we will struggle to extinguish the fire set by the penthouses and we will tear down part of the wall so that there are fire exits, and we will not apologise to anyone for this, it is our European duty!And yes, if we don't manage to put out the fire in this building, after we have built the fire exits, we will get out. We don't owe it to anyone to burn our people for the penthouses of the European Union.We don't want the drachma.I grew up in a Greek capitalism with the drachma, it wasn't socialism.Changing the currency makes no difference. The currency should be the servant of the people, not the people the servants of the currency.We don't want the drachma, leaving the euro has a cost, but we will not sacrifice the future for a euro that is used to achieve what the Wehrmacht failed to achieve.We will not do them the favour of leaving the European Union ever! if we have to go back to our own currency we will create a national currency.But we will never leave the European Union!
