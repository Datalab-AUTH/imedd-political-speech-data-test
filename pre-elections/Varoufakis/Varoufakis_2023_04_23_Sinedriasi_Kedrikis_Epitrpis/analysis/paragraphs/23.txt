Who is Europe? Metternich? No! Lord Byron. The philhellenes who came here and bled, killed, wept, sweated, to fight with us against the sacred alliance of the then troika. There was always the Troika and there were fighters against the Troika.
We are with all Europeans fighting against the Troika.
I will not forget the first Eurogroup I went to in early February 2015.
On that day thousands of Greeks gathered in Syntagma Square. In support of what we were trying to do that day at that Eurogroup. It was moving, but you know what was more moving? The seven thousand Germans who surrounded the European Central Bank building in Frankfurt at the same time, demanding that Draghi listen to the Greek government's proposals.
