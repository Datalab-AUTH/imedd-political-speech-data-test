But an apartment building with no windows and no fire exits. And then they set it on fire, the penthouse bankers, the bankers, all those who drove European capitalism over the cliffs, the banking global crisis of 2007-2008, Deutche bank, Finanz bank, Societe general, BNP Paribas, they basically set fire to the apartment building they had built, the Eurozone apartment building, with no windows and no fire exits, the penthouse bankers set fire to the downstairs apartments, that was austerity, that was privatisation, that was the troikas.
We are and will strive to put out the fire set by the penthouses and we will tear down part of the wall so that there are fire exits.
And we will not apologise to anyone for this, it is our European duty!
And yes if we don't manage to put out the fire in this block of flats, after we have built, fixed the fire exits, we will get out.
We don't owe it to anyone to burn our people for the penthouses of the European Union.
We don't want the drachma.
