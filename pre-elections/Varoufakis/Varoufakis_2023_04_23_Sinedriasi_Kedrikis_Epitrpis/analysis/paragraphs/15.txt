Third lie. That if we leave the euro, we will automatically leave the European Union. So the MERA since it is discussing the creation of a national currency, if necessary, is not our policy, if necessary, so we want to take the country out of the European Union. Stop this nonsense. There is no mechanism to easily kick any country, even if it wants to, out of the European Union. We do not want to. I will come back to this. So the third lie is that if we leave the euro we will leave the European Union. That is not true, as Eric Edman very rightly said in a television programme that the New Democracy lie-truth team did us the honour of getting these statements from Eric, which were excellent. We must congratulate Eric Edman, who, representing the MP25, said one truth, they thought we were caught in the act, that is, if we are thrown out of the euro, we will make our own currency? Of course we will make our own currency. And they thought we were caught in the act. You have the DEMITRA system. I'll revert to the DEMITRA system. Yes, we do. We have submitted it to Parliament as a bill. Do you know why they dislike us? They can't stand that there is a party that tells the truth, that honestly looks at the people and doesn't sell them bullshit. That we tell them that a rupture has a cost, just like the revolution of 21, just like the NO on 28 October. Is there a fuss without a cost? Is there a break with tyranny, a break with debt serfdom, without paying a cost? Doesn't it take virtue and daring? What does virtue and daring mean? What did Calvos mean? He meant that you are willing to pay your cost of liberation.
