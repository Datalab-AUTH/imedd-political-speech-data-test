The answer: DISCEPs everywhere, Consultative Councils of Clerks and Elected Citizens so that society takes the state into its own hands. The rupture is aimed at this perspective, the socialization of the economy, the overcoming of capitalism, a self-managing socialism, a socialism based on socialization and not on the power of the bureaucrat. Friends, with these thoughts, you are candidates, you are candidates, you are candidates, remember what ... how I started? These are good days , enjoy them, have a good time. Because it is beautiful to take the message of MERA25-Alliance for Rice to the people out there, who do not know our message , who need it very much and who will understand how much they need it when you explain it. Enjoy our demonisation too, it is proof that we are on the right track. The elections, I will say it once again, are only one stop on a long road to the creation of the unyielding, selfless, disobedient, fighting Left that we are all building together, all of us together today and here in this Central Committee.
Thank you very much.
