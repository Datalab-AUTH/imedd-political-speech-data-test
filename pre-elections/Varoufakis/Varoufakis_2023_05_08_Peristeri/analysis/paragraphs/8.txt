The first memorandum years. Which were particularly bleak and gave birth. The Golden Dawn-type formations. With the poverty, you remember, with the soup kitchens, with the suicides. But. It was a period. When 99% of Greeks were losing together. Even well-established bourgeois of the colonnade. They were watching their standard of living decline. They may have had apartments in Kolonaki, but they couldn't rent them, they couldn't sell them. The market had collapsed, they had to pay rent, they had property, but they had no money. And they suffered, not of course, like the working class, not like the youth, not like women, not like the immigrants, many of whom were forced to emigrate again during the first years of the memorandum. But it was a situation that all the Greek people. With the exception of Sala and his gang who were intubated by the Memoranda and pocketed pieces of this new debt taken on by the government of Papandreou, Papademos, Venizelos, Samaras and the evil Synapandos. 99% lost together. But with the third memorandum of SYRIZA. And especially the fourth.
