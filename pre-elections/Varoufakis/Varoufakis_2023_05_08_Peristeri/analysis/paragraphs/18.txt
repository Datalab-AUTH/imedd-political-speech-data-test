What do we say about the Super Fund? Abolish it. And transfer the public assets to the new Development Bank, in which it will serve as the capital base of a new public development bank that will use that capital base to generate a flow of capital that will go to biome-type cooperative enterprises that will go to the small and medium-sized enterprises, that will go to the green transition, that will go to the creation of energy communities within the single public electricity utility that will go to the future of our youth, the future of this country, that will be invested in the future of our youth, the future of this country. So that it doesn't become Kosovo with nice beaches.
