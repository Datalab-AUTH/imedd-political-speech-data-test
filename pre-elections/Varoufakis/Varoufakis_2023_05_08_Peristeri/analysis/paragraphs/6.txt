In the Day 25 alliance for rupture we say something very, very simple, this country is not sustainable. This society is not sustainable. It is being deserted every day. Not only are our children not coming abroad, more are leaving. It is no coincidence that the younger generation today is faced with an overwhelming dilemma. Either to leave. Or to stay here, bent over. With low, trimmed expectations. With wages. Humiliating, with no prospects, with rents that are rising exponentially. With education, which is collapsing exponentially, with health care, which is being systematically slashed.
