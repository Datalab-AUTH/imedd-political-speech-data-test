The third goose that lays golden eggs I mentioned before is the Super Fund. At the moment, huge games are being played on the back of the superfund through PPPs, a partnership, it says, between the public and private sectors. Bullshit partnership. There is no partnership. The private sector gets everything and the public sector ensures the profits. That's not even capitalism, in capitalism, you're supposed to be a capitalist. He takes a risk. You read the capital. Volume one, volume two. Marx talks about a capitalism. Where the capitalist's concern is not to go bankrupt. And so he goes on to extract surplus value from labor and the process. In this process with the western. There is no anxiety on the part of the capitalist, because he has the state which ensures him profit. If he makes a profit it is his if he has a loss, it is ours. This is not capitalism. This is a clear feudal state, a feudal plunder.
