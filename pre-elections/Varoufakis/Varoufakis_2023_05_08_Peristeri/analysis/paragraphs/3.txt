Friends, compa√±eras, comrades, companions, fellow travellers. What is at stake in the elections? The big question, you know, the day after tomorrow we will have a goal. So they call it a monologue sequence will be the minute and a half. But there you'll see. The full consensus. Of Messrs Mitsotakis, Tsipras and Androulakis. On one and indeed the most important issue of all. What is their agreement that the country is out of the memoranda? That the country has left the crisis behind. In the euro crisis the debt crisis, the crisis of bankruptcy of the Greek public sector, the crisis of bankruptcy of the Greek private sector and now independent proceeds the same forces to the future and it is a matter. Which of these three gentlemen? Which of these 3 parties will manage the freedom of Greece from the yoke of the memorandum? This is their common narrative, they are interfering, they are competing over which one of them will manage the post-memorandum Greece, which is a wave of their imagination. Because we are in the deepest memorandum, the one signed by the Syriza government in August 2018.
