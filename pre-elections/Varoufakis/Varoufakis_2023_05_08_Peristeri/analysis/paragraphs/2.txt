We are the only country in the world with a super fund. Which was actually legislated and created in the name of the Radical Left. A greater victory for Sch√§uble, a greater victory for the crows, for the predators, for the International Monetary Fund, for Frankfurt, for London, for Paris, for all the executives of the oligarchy without borders, there is no greater victory than the superfund. What do I mean? What is the Super Fund? They made a goal, that's what they call it. It's a bit of a comic book, isn't it, superheroes? They built a fund and put all the public assets into it. Whatever the Greek people have left, that is, what they haven't already sold off, right? And this. They ceded its administration to the lenders. Do you know the Yperatfond? It has an administration. Which is absolutely controlled by the lenders, by whichever of the foreign conquerors of this country after 2010 and Kastelorizo. And that's what happened. It was not done under Papandreou, Papademos, or Samaras, it was not done under the days of the first left. Which I'll be damned if it was the first time left. What does this Superfund mean? That all public property has passed into the hands of foreign powers. Not even the Wehrmacht did this in the 40s during the occupation, nor did India under the yoke of the British Empire have anything so odious and so conquering. Like the Super Fund we have today.
