You don't need to know economics. We went bankrupt in 2010 because our income was 220. And the debt of 300. 220, income 300, debt. Today the income is from 220 to 192 and the debt from 300 to 400. Then why are the markets rejoicing and triumphing and actually the Greek government borrowing rates are relatively low 4 something in the 100 relatively low. In nominal terms why? It's very simple. Because the European Central Bank has decided. To cover up the bankruptcy of the public sector. Like they did with the first memorandum, what did they do with the first memorandum? We were bankrupt and they gave us 110 billion to give to the French-German banks to pretend that we were paying back. And with our second memorandum as another 130, as a second credit card to draw on. To pretend to pay off the first credit card. The third memorandum, a third credit card and so on, the fourth memorandum storming was I gave, it's new money, they had some left over from the third from the third credit card, but they took 110 billion that was paid off in the 20s and put it in the 30s tokens. It's a loan and another credit card and that's what they will continue to do. It's not hard to pretend a bankrupt person is not bankrupt by lending them more under conditions though that allow you, the lender, to take what you have and don't have from them. For the looting we see today. It is a question. Of the Treaties by which they pass on our bankruptcy, growing it and deepening it into the future.
