Let me remind the old timers who have been with Day 25 from the very first moment we founded Day 25 in March 2018. We waited, we waited, we hoped other extra-parliamentary extra-parliamentary forces on the left would take the first step to get the no vote back into parliament but it didn't happen. It was then at the beginning of 2018 when it was clear by now that the Syriza government was launching the biggest lie in post-war Greece that it would get us out of the memorandum. The fourth memorandum signed in August 2018. They called it a post-memorandum because they had learned well the Goebbels manual which says what? If you want to tell a big lie, you take the truth, you turn it upside down. He created a huge lie and repeats it over and over and over again. That's Goebbels' playbook. Read it. Don't read it, believe it. If you want to quote Goebbels, get Orwell. So the bilingualism. The inversion of the truth you take the phrase fourth memorandum and turn it into a post-memorial.
