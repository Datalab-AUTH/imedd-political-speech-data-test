This country will end up mathematically if you and we don't do something, People who are not with us yet and have to come with us if we don't do something. And what is that something or rupture? The rupture with this process that deserts the country if we don't do something, the country will turn into a Kosovo. With beautiful beaches. Why am I referring to Kosovo? Anyone who has been to Kosovo recently will see that something is missing. There are no young people in Kosovo, they have all left. If you go to Pristina the capital of Kosovo and get a debit card and put in an ATM euro will get you out. And they have euros. And young people don't have them remind you of anything, that's where we're going.
