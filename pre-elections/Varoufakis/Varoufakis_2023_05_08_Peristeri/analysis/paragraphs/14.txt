we go to the second goose. Overshoot, not throw. I'll go to this one, it's the third one. Energy Exchange. Well. Those who post, what happened in the late '70s in Britain, late '70s and we have here the Kuvelakis stand. We had a prime minister. Do you remember that a Mrs. Thatcher? Who. She was particularly. Effective in breaking public goods, public utilities into many pieces, privatizing them what we saw here with the PPP. What we have seen with the public utility what we are seeing now with water was first taught by Thatcher, so here from the dove I want to look you in the eye and tell you that Syriza, New Democracy, the Republic and PASOK are much worse than Thatcher and don't turn around and tell me that I am a Thatcherite because Syriza and New Democracy and PASOK are worse under Thatcher. Some of us spent our youth on pickets, in demonstrations, getting beaten up by Mrs Thatcher's mounted police, but really comrades, comrades, comrades-in-arms, friends. These people here are worse than Asia and I will prove it to you.
