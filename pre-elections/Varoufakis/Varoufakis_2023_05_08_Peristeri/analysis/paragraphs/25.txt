We condemned Putin as a war criminal. I personally condemned him in 2001. For killing 250,000 Chechens to establish his autocracy in Moscow. We do not mince our words, neither Putin nor NATO. A movement of nonaligned, that's what we stand for. We are working with Amlo, the President of Mexico, together with the comrades of the Communist Party of Cuba, together with Lula who will be with us in Brazil in August. What other party in Greece works so systematically? The Pigeon. Nationwide. Pan-European, through Diem25, you know that this week Day 25 Germany is running in the elections in the state bremen. Internationalism in practice.
