What do PASOK and SYRIZA say? We will protect the first home. And how are you guys going to do that? As long as the hercules exists and red loans are bought and sold. You can't protect the first home when everything is bought and sold, because they contain basic housing and small shops you are fooling people, we read very carefully the proposal of SYRIZA to protect the first home. Do you know what it says? It safeguards the excess profits of the funds under the cloak of progressiveness, the Left and progress. How does it do this? What does it say? You will get it, it says, the fund will take the house but it will give you a 50% haircut. Obviously he's going to give you a haircut. Do you remember the example of The Numerator? We buy 3 grand to give 100. They never believe, they're going to get 100; they're going to get 50 and Syriza comes in and ensures at 50 they can get it on Cayman Island and they call that basic housing protection. The same people who took the NO of the Greek people. And in a vulgar way that night of the referendum, while we were all celebrating a unique moment in the history of the global left, of the global democratic movement. They took the NO vote and turned it into a Yes vote, together with the new democracy that they took out of the wastebasket, to which the Greek people had condemned it, together with PASOK, together with the river, remember.
