The debt of disobedience is the only one we recognize. 4 years ago, friends, fellow travellers, compa√±eros and comrades. We were in the town hall, we were far fewer. Nevertheless, we managed to put the OXI, the brave OXI of the Greek people back in Parliament until we achieved it, the OXI had been banished. Today I received a series of questions from one of the mainstream media. Interview. First question, Mr Varoufakis. Did this country see and feel that it could escape from the anti-memorandum frenzy and move forward. And you are bringing this dream back into the consciousness of the Greek people? First question. We have to look them in the eye. And thunder them. That the no vote was a high point in the history of the global left of the global democratic movement. It was a unique one. A ray of hope in the gloom that has prevailed since the crisis of 2008 worldwide our 1929 our interwar that gave birth to the golden dawns of Le Pen, Trump, Orban all this dream of fascism born out of the crisis, the global crisis of capitalism that hit this country worse than any country, no country in the world lost 28% of its national income. No country in the world is now on a lower income than it was 13 years ago. And more debt to say it once again there is no country in the world today with lower income than it had 13 years ago and more debt. There is no country in the world, another novelty of the Memorandumists who want to convince us that the Memoranda have been left behind and that we are now free and beautiful, free and beautiful and sailing on the seas of freedom and independence.
