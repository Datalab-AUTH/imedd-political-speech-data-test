Is it possible our companions ask me some? Are the Syrians the same as the Democrats? Of course they are not the same. If you enter. In the houses. Our comrade to our comrades in the Syriza you will see that they have pretty much the same books in our libraries. We come from the same cultural and political background. We have the same readings, the same listening we have seen the movies, we have cried to the same music. They have nothing to do with the new democracy or does that hurt us as much as the energy stock exchange, Hercules, Alexandroupolis? The Hyperfund was passed in the name of our common culture. We have an obligation to untie these people from SYRIZA. From a leadership that in the name or in the sense of the lesser evil of the lesser evil is doing the greatest evil, because this is the logic of the lesser evil, guys, a little better than them. Let's vote for them these are not Semitic. Semitis wasn't saying they are a little better. From the new democracy and he was better than the new democracy. Remember the racist narrative of the New Democracy? Then in 2000, when it was launched against the Albanians, PASOK was a little bit better than the new democracy. Yes, but what the left always said was that this was a false dilemma and they were in a dilemma because the logic of the lesser evil leads to the greatest evil both in 2000 with Simitis and today with the memorandum establishment, which is what it is presented as.
