 What do we say? Abolition of the Hercules market. Finally, without further discussion, the creation of a public company for the management of red debts. Red debts go through everything. To the e-books. What we call Ulysses, the Polymath, who is coming to replace Hercules. The borrower is not forgiven because it's unfair to the other person who managed to pay it back, but you don't foreclose, you don't evict, you don't throw it out. Plus. You charge him a small fee per month not to exceed 1/6th of his disposable income and if he's below a certain income you don't charge him anything. He lives in his house, runs his shop with one employee 2 employees. You don't throw them out to be auctioned off by the predatory fund. The same with the farm land which is also redundant, the farmer, the farmer's wife continues to cultivate it. Forever if necessary. Are you freezing it? And hold on to that man. The percentage of her ownership in the particular case I gave you the example of has already paid off before the crisis 2/3 of the original price today with what is going on. He's left with zero. After the auction zero he has paid 2/3 and is left with zero. What do we say; if you've given 2/3 you keep it as if you have shares in the. Property. 2/3. And when in the future you either sell it. Because you can't sell it unless you have a settlement with Ulysses. You make a deal, we sell it, Ulysses keeps 1/3. And you get 2/3 since you're a shareholder of the 2 thirds of the property, because you've paid off 2/3 of the property. That's when you can do it when you can. Without any enforcement will somebody tell me? I don't have a red loan and then what do I care? You want me to tell you why you care? Because the house next door to yours in the shop next door to yours someone has a red loan. And when the predatory fund that has grabbed it puts it under the hammer, the value of your property will go down too. That's why you care.
