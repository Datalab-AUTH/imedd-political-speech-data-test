We are the first to speak for ourselves and no one caught us in the act. We came out after we filed the bill in December 2020 when Ulysses and Hercules were in and other things. It was a multi-bill. Then. we were just allowed by COVID. We had a workshop on the gas. Where we had a very important professor from Brown University in the United States. I had with Nikos Theocharakis, my colleague who is also now number two. Right behind wisdom on our state ballot. And we did a full analysis of Dimitra. A whole day-long video on YouTube for the whole world to see and in which I made a specific reference to the fact that one of the merits of demitra is that in the event of a banking crisis, because demitra is not built on banks, it's built on taxisnet. And the banks getting in trouble, that keeps running. Which what it does is reduce the social cost of a banking crisis, whether it's spontaneous or whether it's caused by the European Central Bank to create a suffocation for us and I said further in case we need to create a national currency. The demitrage system is the foundation on which we will build. And therefore it reduces the cost of creating a national currency. We don't want to create a national currency because we will. There will be a cost to that transition, but we have a system that has all the advantages plus it reduces the cost to you. Of the transition to a national currency, which makes it. It gives you more bargaining power with those who threaten you. That they will take you out of the euro. It's like the Secretary of Defense saying I have a foreign invasion deterrence plan. What patriot can tell him? A. War monger are you planning a war? Anyone who says that is an idiot. That's what we're being told now, because what happened?
