Why am I saying this? What is the one thing the people are asking for right now? That Mitsotakis should fall? That is what we are committed to as the 25 day 25 alliance for the break. Our goal is to bring down Mitsotakis and his anonymous company. But not only to bring down Mitsotakis. But also the causes of Mitsotakis you remember once we on the left used to say about crimes, about criminality, that you have to hit the crime, but it is more important to hit the causes of the crime which are. Impoverishment is marginalization. It's patriarchy, it's sexism, and it's not just catching someone and putting them in jail. So we are committed to ending the existing machoctarianism. Except that actual machoctarianism. It's not personal, Mitsotakis may well be gone tomorrow. Remember, George Papandreou left after the first memorandum. And what did we gain? Papademos came. Along with Samaras, Venizelos, Stournaras, the whole pair. So Papademos left. Samaras came. What does that matter to the Greek people? The day after Mitsotakis leaves. What will we do? Because you know if things don't improve? Will we have? We will have contributed to the restoration of Mitsotakis. Even progressive people will say he wasn't so bad after all. He's gone, but things haven't changed for that.
