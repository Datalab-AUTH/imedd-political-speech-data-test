4 years ago. Such a time. About this time, a month later we were here in another place. Where again we had an election season, it was the first time that day 25 was running a national election. And. Like today. The enduring question is. Will you support a Syriza government to bring down Mitsotakis? The question 4 years ago, let me remind you what the question was? Why are you guys running? You're paving the way for Mitsotakis. You're splitting the left. Wasn't that the question? We didn't do it lightly. May I remind you? That. Despite the intense conflict of those of us who resigned, we left office. And we fell into the fire of demonization both by the new democracy and PASOK and Potami then, whoever remembers, and by SYRIZA, which capitulated, overturned the no we left. We came under fire from the entire memorandum arc. Nevertheless, we the day 25. We the day 25, the day 25, we created it, we founded it. Do you remember when in March 2018? 2 years later. 3 years after 15, we basically waited. We waited we were giving opportunities to other parties of the extra-parliamentary left, like the PLA. We waited to see what you would do. In SYRIZA Bash and they have the epiphany again? Of the people. They hadn't had it since January February 2018 that they were going straight for the fourth memorandum in the summer of 2018, which was worse in one important respect, because they presented it as an exit from the memoranda. There is a worse memorandum than this one that you present as the end of the memoranda, when in particular it lasts until 2060 and ties your hands in imaginative and scientifically designed ways that were not the case in the previous memoranda.
