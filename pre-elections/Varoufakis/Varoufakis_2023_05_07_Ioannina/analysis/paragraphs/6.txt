Look. The left has, or should have, a long memory. That argument. The rationale? The lesser of two evils. We vote for this because it's a lesser evil than that. That reasoning doesn't work. All it succeeds in doing is feeding the greatest evil. Why is that? Remember? Pasok, New Democracy, under Simitis. What did they tell us leftists? The Semites. Who do you prefer? Prime Minister Karamanlis or Semitis, a little better, isn't Semitis? Maybe, but when he follows the policy of the lesser of two evils of the lesser of two evils. You take the whole political scene and every day you move it further to the right. Why if it's true? That Simitis is less evil than Karamanlis. Then Simitis knows that the Left is his. We'll support him, vote for him to keep Karamanlis out. And what will be the result? He will lean more and more. In all policies. That the system imposes on him. Is it true for Semitis? Is it true of Tsipras today?
