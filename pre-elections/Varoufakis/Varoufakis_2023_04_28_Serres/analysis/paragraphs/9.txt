That's what we've been doing for 4 years, we look them in the eye in Parliament and we tell them, but of course.
When the channels are owned by the owners of the funds themselves.
To the companies that give you indirectly from the energy exchange, not only the one that owns DEDDIE, but also the ones that own PPC.
The old PPC, CVC another fund in London the Mytilineos, the Peristeri, Vardinoyannis, Latsis or Melissanidis. All those who eat with huge spoons, forks and knives these are the owners of the channels.
So whatever we say in Parliament, if you do not listen, if you do not watch the 25.gr day, you will not find out.
