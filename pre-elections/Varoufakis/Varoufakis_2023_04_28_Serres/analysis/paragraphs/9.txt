But also in the final analysis.
Sustainability requires virtue and courage.
The ability of this country not to turn its children away. We do not want to leave the euro. It's a clear demetra system.
It is a system that every country in the eurozone should have.
It allows you to breathe better and reduces the banker's monopoly on the shop.
To the citizen, to society, so that society breathes better within the euro, but it is not bad at all that in case you have to leave the euro.
Because you never know what happens? Germany can leave now see. Do you believe that Germany does not have an exit plan from the euro? The Deutsche Bank, the Central Bank of Germany has no plan for what they should do step one, step two, step three if they have to get out and we have to cut the Deutschmark again and of course they would be despicable towards the German people if they didn't have a plan what we are being accused of here.
It is what we are.   
And I specifically so I am very much honored by being told that I am dangerous because I have a plan to exit the euro.
