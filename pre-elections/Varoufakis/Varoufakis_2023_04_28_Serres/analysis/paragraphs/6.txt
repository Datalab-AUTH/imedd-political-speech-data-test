Take the VAT. Are we in Serres? Bulgaria is a stone's throw from here. I'm going to the hotel here. VAT: 24%.
There's 9 9.
Income tax is 10. Business tax is 10%. Here what is it? 22%, with 100% prepayment will it be possible to survive the business business on the pages when you have this situation in Bulgaria?
So? We make talk in the Parliament and do How to lower the VAT. I don't want to take it to 9-10. From 24 to 15
So does anyone disagree with that? You know, nobody disagrees. And Stakoras and Tsakalotos were Finance Ministers recently, after me. Between us we agree.
It's ridiculous to have 24% VAT in this country, everybody knows that.
What's the argument of when the cameras don't?
John, they won't let us. Who won't let us? Because you know, the troika left.
The lie.
They want you to glorify them that they got rid of the troika when they themselves tell you that the troika won't let us and if you tell them nice and at least in theory we haven't said anything about the memoranda they tell you that you're not even on enhanced supervision. Fine, let's come and legislate together. You don't want to go to 15% VAT? Take it to 19. I chose 19, you know why? Because it's Germany's VAT. We can't, we have European requirements, European restrictions.
You in Germany is 19%, Germany is not Europe, so what are the Germans for Germany to have 19% and it's also a powerful country, so don't be silly to have 24%. No one will tell you that you are anti-European if you choose the VAT of Europe, of Europe, of Germany.
