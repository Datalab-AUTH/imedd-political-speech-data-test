Let me tell you how is it different that the aim is to give it to Vardinoyannis, to give it to Latsis who collects through you the money that the Greek state borrows?
That is what is done.
They subsidize the oligarchs with the surpluses, which they take out of the Greek social economy and less people come to the shops and Latsis Vardinoyannis, Melissanidis and
they invest it in Indonesia or they go to Cayman Islands.
That's what happens when you have a state, a government that operates as an anonymous company.
