Let me tell you how is it different that the aim is to give it to Vardinoyannis, to give it to Latsis who collects through you the money that the Greek state borrows?
That is what is done.
They subsidize the oligarchs with the surpluses, which they take out of the Greek social economy and less people come to the shops and Latsis Vardinoyannis, Melissanidis and
they invest it in Indonesia or they go to Cayman Islands.
That's what happens when you have a state, a government that operates as an anonymous company.
My friends.
We have gone through 13 years of memoranda, have you gone through 13 years of memoranda if we don't stop them?
This memorandum process that is not called memoranda. Of course now it will continue until Greece.
ceases to exist in substance what does that mean?
Imagine becoming a country, either like Kosovo. Or like Hawaii.
If you go to Kosovo.
You go to Pristina and put a card in an ATM, will you get a card? Kosovo has euros.
It's not officially in the eurozone, but it has euros. So that's the official currency of Kosovo.
Walk around Pristina you won't see any new people. They have all left.
This country.
Country call it what you want say what is not viable has the euro.
So it has a European Commissioner, it has a NATO army, as we have here so but Kosovo is finished. It will never be able to create a vibrant society the same in Hawaii. Anyone who goes to Hawaii don't go suck it.
You will see it is a beautiful island, like our country is, a beautiful country with a very nice coastline.
Around the beaches are five-star hotels. The natives live in shacks in the centre of the island, the mini-bas come and pick them up in the morning at 06:00 in the morning they take them to the hotels, clean toilets, play the Hawaiian guitars and in the evening they take them back to the shacks
back to their troughs. This is what Greece will become if there is no break.
A break with what's been going on for 13 years.
