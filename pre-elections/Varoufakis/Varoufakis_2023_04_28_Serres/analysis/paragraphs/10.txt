It's like accusing a Minister of Defence.
To accuse the Minister of Defence of having a plan for what to do if the foreign army invades the country.
Think about it, he says, do you have a plan for how you will react if the foreigners close our banks?
The equivalent is not with Erdogan.
Do we have a plan the Ministry of Defence for what happens If we get Castellorizo, I hope we do if the Minister of Defence doesn't have a plan for what happens if Turkey comes in and takes Castellorizo, then he's a despicable Minister of Defence. His job is to have a plan, it means the Minister of Defence wants it very much. No of course the same applies to us it is clear.
