Too many people fought. We recently had the anniversary of 21/04, they gave their blood so that we could be able to speak without being booed by security.
To go to the polls, to cast our vote. That alone does not bring democracy.
It is not a sufficient condition for democracy, but it is a necessary condition and because we still have a party. The Day 25 coalition for the break we say, what we believe and we believe what we say and there are no shadows.
We are not afraid of the political cost, as the story of Demeter proves, we are not hiding, we say everything as we feel and we feel as we say it, which means that we can pour into the streets, in Serres, throughout Greece.
Carrying the truths about what is happening to the people, to the people to whom it is happening, who don't know it because the media of mass deception and deception hide it from them.
And have fun and have fun a lot. It's revolutionary to have a good time while doing politics. Thank you very much.
Come on up.
Come on up, candidates and candidates
