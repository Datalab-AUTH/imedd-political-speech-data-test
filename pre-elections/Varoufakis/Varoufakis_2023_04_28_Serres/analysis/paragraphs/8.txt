You know your children and your grandchildren have been assured of a minimum or minimal profit in the coffers from all this looting of people's homes and shops. Minimum profit 23 billion. Do you know what that means? That if we don't get it something is done and they couldn't put the hammer down to get that money? To pan to the Cayman Islanders You guys we are guaranteeing our children, our grandchildren a minimum profit at 23 billion. Do you know how much our government is giving to our entire national health care system? Five and a half to the whole education system and from there five and a half to six, that is, the total of health and education is around 11 and Mr Mitsotakis has guaranteed 23 billion minimum profit. In these funds, which the state does not have to give to need, your children will borrow them from the troika on conditions. It will not be the memorandum. The growth of Greece is not a problem. Finding imaginative lies.
