The time has come, friends. Comrade companions. The time has come to work for the new great left, the new great militant left that will govern, that will create a majority.
What is the art of progressive politics? It is the art of creating conditions
for a majority.
This has happened.
Very few times in history had Alienesti Chile achieved it; Andreas Papandreou achieved it in 1981. We achieved it in Syriza in 2015.
In the case of Allende, did they kill him?
In the case of 15 our government capitulated.
We are here to look you in the eye and tell you that we may be defeated, but we will not capitulate.
The art of creating a broad majority.
We will conquer it together, not just as day 25.
What we have achieved in the last year since the decision of the first inter-parliamentary council of the Day 25 Congress is that we have opened our doors, we have opened our arms.
To a wide range.
From left-wing militants, with whom I had until recently disagreed with.
It is a huge personal thrill for me that with popular unity we are together.
That we are together with the aras that we are together with people of the left, such as Christos Laskos Thessaloniki, such as Dimitris Zervoudakis, such as the awesome amazing Hero Dioti from Larissa, Marios Dionellis from Heraklion.
We are laying the foundations for the new great faction of the militant left that will bring hope, hope. We cannot promise more than that. We do not populate hope.
That this country will become viable again, but something that requires rupture.
It won't happen at the grassroots.
Of closed-door meetings with the political representatives of Vardinoyannis of Latsis.
The CVC of the Macquarie and the bad clash.
