Friends, fellow travellers and fellow travellers, let us welcome the leader of the day 25 alliance for rupture Yanis Varoufakis.Good evening, good evening, good evening, good evening to all.It is very nice to be together in this election period. For a long time now to our members here at day 25, we have been promising that we will come, we have not succeeded so I feel very good that especially at this juncture we are here. Because you know there are important things going on behind your backs behind our backs in our name, in your name against us, against you. With examples in the essence of what is at stake in this election, what is at stake in the election then?
