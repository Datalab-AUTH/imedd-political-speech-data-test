If you're a limited company, there's nothing wrong with operating as a limited company, but when the state behaves like a business, it's the end of society.
To give you an example?
We are asked to applaud the government that has, says the state. The state budget surplus.
That for a corporation is fine, but here the store again I take the example. I like that because it's right next to me. It has a surplus so that's good for the store it means it has a profit its revenue is more than expenses now. May you have a surplus.
On the good side, right?
