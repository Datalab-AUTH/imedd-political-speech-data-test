Here comes a predatory fund from Ireland with headquarters in Delaware and a bank account in the Cayman Islands. And they go and they take your house. Have you? Have you bought it in the good times? Let's say 150,000 you had a loan 100k 50 out of your pocket 100 loan out of 100 loan you had paid off 50 at some point you can't pay it off because of the crisis, not because you're because of the crisis you lost your job, your business wasn't doing well. Fine, it could be a house, it could be a shop. Where you owed 50 you had given the 100 the 150 grand to buy the house where you owed 50 the 50 with overcoats became 100 and here comes the headfund this predatory fund. The strangest thing is that it goes and buys your loan which is now 100,000 by giving 3000. 3000 has been brought from abroad and this, Mr. Mitsotakis considers it a direct foreign investment, what do you think?
