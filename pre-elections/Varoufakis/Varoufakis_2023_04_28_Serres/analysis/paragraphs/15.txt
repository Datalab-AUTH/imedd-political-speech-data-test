Look at how they take it, their tactic is what?
The first thing they tell you is that taking us out of the euro equals a national disaster. We're going to die.
Which is not true. There will be a cost to leaving but it won't be a national disaster, but okay, it's a package deal. It's 2 steps, the first one will get us kicked out of the euro.
And the second is we'll have a national disaster. The second step is what? Whatever you tell them?
What's the first step? For the CVC that we were talking about before on red loans he tells you if you legislate, anything of what you guys are saying day 25 cut VAT, abolish the Hercules purchase, create Ulysses which is our proposal for a public company to manage red loans so that that money doesn't go to Kaman Island at least what do they tell you if you get him to legislate on it, as day 25 Alliance for Breakdown says.
Then they will close our banks and kick us out of the euro. So according to step one, national disaster. it's a lie.
