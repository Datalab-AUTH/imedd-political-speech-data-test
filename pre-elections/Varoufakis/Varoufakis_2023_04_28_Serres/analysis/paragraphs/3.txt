When the channels are owned by the owners of the funds themselves.
To the companies that give you indirectly from the energy exchange, not only the one that owns DEDDIE, but also the ones that own PPC.
The old PPC, CVC another fund in London the Mytilineos, the Peristeri, Vardinoyannis, Latsis or Melissanidis. All those who eat with huge spoons, forks and knives these are the owners of the channels.
So whatever we say in Parliament, if you do not listen, if you do not watch the 25.gr day, you will not find out.

The law says that these days you have to put MERA 25 on the channels as well. what does it do; the frymast of black propaganda started when Varoufakis said he would close the banks.
They have discovered an excellent system which we have designed to allow you to cooperate with each other and with the government.
In euros, free, whose you know is a nightmare of the bankers, other friends of Mitsotakis SA they so.
And they started. Now we had a question from a journalist. But will you close the banks?
