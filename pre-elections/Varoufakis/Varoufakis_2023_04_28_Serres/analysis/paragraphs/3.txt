A bank of yours and they're holding Australia, they call it Macquarie and here we are. There's a camera I call them criminals and I urge them very much to sue me. The people are clearly criminals. Their criminal careers do not start here and we will give you an example. They went to Britain years ago and bought the water company of the London borough of London. Does any city on the outskirts, London, have a water company. And overall sewage sewers. They gave Â£5 billion. 2 They gave the 3 they borrowed it by mortgaging the company they bought like I come to your house say give me a loan you I'll buy it from you and I'll mortgage it to your house I'll mortgage it and then in the next few years extraordinarily did McQuarrie with the London water company loaded a total of 10.4 or 10.5 billion pounds of debt on that company and what did they do with it? Why does London have a water supply problem? It rains in the summer season, sewage falls into the river, in the sea it is the same, not in the 10 billion borrowed, by mortgaging the former public. Water and sewerage business they put it in their pockets. It's a criminal organization now because I'm talking to you about this McQuarrie? Mr. Mitsotakis sold the tithing when he knows what will happen on 01/05?
