We didn't make Day 25 to hand out ministerial cars. Let alone I don't get into a car with a motorcycle.
So basically what are they saying?
They're saying they're not interested in a progressive government. They want to be the same ministers and prime ministers with a progressive face, with a cloth that says we are Progress.
So of the left and progress. But that's the worst you can do on the Left.
Conquering power, usurping it.
Yes, you implement unpopular measures because the Troika says so and what can we do? Because otherwise they will close our banks and to do this in the name of the Left is over Left, there is no Left. Then there will be a chance that a young person will ever hear the word left and not go away and get out of here too.
Well, let's be clear.
We.
Since they have closed the door to dialogue and there is no room for a coherent coherent government program to be worked out after the election, we will blackball you.
And our role will be in the House more and more to continue to do what we have been doing and.
Not just an extension of the previous four years.
