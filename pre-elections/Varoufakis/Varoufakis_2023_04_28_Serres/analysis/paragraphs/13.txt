What did we say? We had an order to cut the social security. Do you remember what the ESSP is? A man who was receiving a 200 euro pension, he was receiving the ESSP, but he had made 150 this waiver and would almost give something to the ESSP, that is, he was going from 200 to 350 and the whole central banker of the European Central Bank was coming.
As if he was not ashamed. Mr. Draghi, Mrs. Lagarde. From Washington, from the IMF. Tell us what. You have to cut that out. Cut it out. And if you don't. If you don't cut it, I'm going to close the banks. Well, some of us then said close the banks.
We're not going to sacrifice the starving pensioners, not the big pensioners who are getting some big pension.
But you go to the man who gets â‚¬350 and say you're going to do 200 or I'm going to close the banks. This is a terrorist move by the European Central Bank. They are doing it and you know?
