Look to see if the Europeans.
The Europeans, the other Europeans, why are we Europeans? So don't forget this is not Europe somewhere else. Here is Europe. This is where Europe starts, this is where the heart of Europe beats, as much as it beats in Berlin.
But those in power in Frankfurt, in Berlin, in Paris, in Brussels tell us that if you dare and you know something, I don't think they will say so much anymore.
The European Union is in a state of disintegration, you see, they are arguing about everything, they cannot agree on types of things that will close our banks because we are going to bring VAT to 15%.
