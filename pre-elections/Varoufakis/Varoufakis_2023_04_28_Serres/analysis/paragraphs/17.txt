The other day.
As I was walking down the street in Athens.
A young man stopped me and said, "I'm not interested in parties. Just.
I found a politician and I wanted to tell him something.
We young people have no life in this country.
He got up and left.
I'm not saying he was with us, he wasn't with us. That's it.
A reality, a brutal reality. His generation of lazy people.
That has changed.
The psychology of the majority of the people, why really?
After Tempe nothing is the same anymore. The youth have mastered the knowledge that if they don't rise up.
As this young man on the streets of Athens told me, there is no future here, our children are divided between 2 groups. Those who plan to leave and others who have decided to live a stooped life in this country with no prospects, no plans no plans no dreams no hope just day by day.
This is not something we will continue to feed.
