We as a parliamentary party have achieved
One thing.
We put the no to this.
That amazing, brave, magnificent NO of 05/07/2015 we put it back in the Parliament, we were alone in it, the only one,
We support that No in Parliament. Do you know that?
I have to say it because the M.C.E. did not support the NO. Do you remember that?
He said that it was an illusion to vote no.
The only one who supports that no. We in Parliament.
The second thing we did is that.
We went beyond no because saying no after a while is tiring. You can't keep saying no, you have to say something positive.
