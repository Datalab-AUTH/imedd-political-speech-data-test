Look at how they take it, their tactic is what?
The first thing they tell you is that taking us out of the euro equals a national disaster. We're going to die.
Which is not true. There will be a cost to leaving but it won't be a national disaster, but okay, it's a package deal. It's 2 steps, the first one will get us kicked out of the euro.
And the second is we'll have a national disaster. The second step is what? Whatever you tell them?
What's the first step?
For the CVC that we were talking about before on red loans he tells you if you legislate, anything of what you guys are saying day 25 cut VAT, abolish the Hercules purchase, create Ulysses which is our proposal for a public company to manage red loans so that that money doesn't go to Kaman Island at least what do they tell you if you get him to legislate on it, as day 25 Alliance for Breakdown says.
Then they will close our banks and kick us out of the euro. So according to step one, national disaster. it's a lie.
It is a way of never being discussed pre-election post-election in parliament.
These are not to be discussed these, which are the prerequisites to be.
Sustainable our country because all those things I mentioned tax, red loans, energy.
They are key ingredients for it to be.
Sustainable country is not our sustainable country. Our children continue to go overseas as long as we don't do what the day 25 coalition proposes for the rupture and what is the only answer? No one is saying we are wrong.
No one is saying we are wrong. What are they saying? If you do what they say you're going to do, they're going to close our banks?
