What we said is that we want to build a system which is independent and close the banks, you can trade with each other for free.
But you will close the banks.
Have you heard of a mighty Swiss bank Credit Swiss, which collapsed, closed down a few weeks ago?
There the depositors had no problem there, because there is a mighty Swiss state that had money and basically covered the deposits of the people both through the government and through the Ministry of Finance and through the Central Bank. Because they have Swiss francs there; we don't have say that there deposits are guaranteed up to 100,000 by whom? By the state. Where will you find them? If the National Bank and Piraeus collapse? We say there's a DIMITRA system. It doesn't solve the problem of a banking crisis. But it does reduce costs.
Because you have a system that does not depend on the bankers, they don't waste you like they do now to go pay here in the cafe with a card, you will darken the soul of the owner and because they will eat whatever percentage of profit this man here that man has, the banker will eat it through the plastic card I see sometimes I have no change on me and I go to pay with a card, and there goes the man, there goes the other one to melt. He doesn't say anything to me he's polite. So we want to make such a system, which is very, very simple.
