We love digital technology, we have proven it, which other party hasapplication for mobile? Download it day 25, whether you have an iPhone or you have Android. You'll find a map of what's going on around you. From the day 25 alliance for rupture right now what other party do you know that we have built day 25 chatbot day 25 you ask him question you tell him what is his day 25 alliance for rupture policy, on Greek-Turkish? And he answers you, he doesn't show you text ready he scans all the texts, all the speeches of our executives and our members and makes through artificial intelligence. We love technology, we love artificial intelligence, but because we are Marxists, what do we say? What matters is who owns the means of production, who owns these technical means? There is no social democracy, it's over. We can't believe that the state will regulate the markets, the state doesn't understand the markets anymore, it doesn't have the capacity to do so. We want a communal ownership of the socialisation of the means of production, especially artificial intelligence. Especially what we call cloud capital, the capital that lives digitally now. We are a party that respects the history of the left of the Marxist left, of anarcho-syndicalism that knew that the enemy is not only capital, but also the bureaucrat. The history of the EAM ELAS. The history of the Polytechnic, the history of 114 before it,the history of the 2015 rupture that never became a model. That's why we first say break with the day 25 alliance for the break and yet at the same time we look ahead we speak the language of modern technology, because we know that the new modern, generalized forms of exploitation will be made on the basis of modern technology. If we do not succeed in socializing the most advanced capital that is being born today in both the United States and China.
