Good evening to Chania Good evening to all. It's nice to be here. And it is a special honour for me to present today the ballot paper for the prefecture of Chania. Before I talk about the ballot paper in particular, 2 references. To 2 fellow comrades. Comrade. Who adorn our state ballot paper Alexandra Kasimi and comrade Psarantoni who is in Heraklion will be with us tomorrow night. It is no small thing to have Kasimi and Psarantonis on a party's state ballot paper.
