Some people say But what are you talking about? Read the sanctions. Read the contracts, the contracts say 11% of Exxonmobil's profits will go to the Greek state. Do you know how much they are fellow travelers? Comrades comrades the 11% of zero, a big zero. But they won't have profits of course and they will have profits. They will have big profits. But who will have the profits? Exxonmobil, Mom. Exxonmobil of America. So here we will have Exxonmobil Hellas, which is a subsidiary of Exxonmobil Mama. Exxonmobil Hellas, I guarantee you, will have zero profits, there's no easier thing in the world, you know what they do? Exxonmobil Hellas. They'll come in, they'll drill here, they'll take out the oil, the gas. They're going to be surging with profits and excess profits while our environment is being destroyed. It will have for example 5 billion in profit. Right? And Exxonmobil will sell mom to Exxonmobil Hellas, a piece of old paper that will be some know-how. A floating rig. Which will cost 5 billion. So the 5 billion profit. Dissipate, cancel. Because the 5 billion that Exxonmobil Hellas or Exxonmobil Greece have supposedly given to Exxonmobil Mom is recorded as a cost. And Exxonmobil Greece's balance sheet will show zero profit. 11% of zero zero. As we used to say. That's what they're doing.
