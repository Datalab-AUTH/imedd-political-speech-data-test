And unfortunately, and I say this with a heavy heart. Do you know who first brought these kinds of contracts to the Greek parliament? SYRIZA. The conventions of the New Democracy were carbon copies. They were carbon, and who voted for them from the opposition benches? SYRIZA. It's not even that they said what we did wrong, you guys. Now we are in opposition, we have learned a lesson. And we are aligning the interests of the Greek people with the interests of the nature of humanity. I'm afraid that I'm afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm glad because this will not exist, even mining or even exist when they start to pump oil and gas. They will stop because the cost will be too high. The revenue will be very little compared to renewables. This is all being done to eat now. They have fallen like predators with golden knives and forks. All these contracts today you know they are currently paying them back in 2 ways. The studies that make 10 million here and 10 million there, the Greek state pays for them. All this is being done in Lamborghini in Kifissia, real estate in Chania, investments in the Cayman Islands. Today, the second way, do you know what it is? They make derivatives in which they sell the future revenues. The future revenues of Exxonmobil, and today they sell them and sell them like they used to sell the future tolls under Semitic, you remember, they used to sell the future tolls, and that is what they are doing today, eating with golden spoons. This is what Mitsotakis SA means and this is what a SYRIZA who silenced them even before Mitsotakis SA was created, when Alexis Tsipras was still Prime Minister.
