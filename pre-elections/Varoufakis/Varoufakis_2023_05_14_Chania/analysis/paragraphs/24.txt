There are too many people out there. Who are highly skeptical of parties. I understand them. We sympathize with them, they have every right. After the people were overthrown on the night of the referendum. When a Radical Left party asked the people to be brave. And the people showed unbelievable bravery, they went against all the international centres of oligarchy without borders, they went against the European Central Bank with its closed banks, they went against Brussels, they went against Berlin, he went against Washington, against the International Monetary Fund, against the mass deception media that terrorized him in his living rooms in his house with the TVs every night and told him if you vote no, we will have Armageddon. And these people voted 63% No Pasaran voted no pass. Don't back down, they were telling me here in Chania. I remember 25/03 I had come with Danae. And we were then with the others, with Polakis and the others,break. Don't back down. Do not dare to betray. That night they subverted the people in the name of the Left, how with Meimarakis do you remember Pavlopoulos in the presidential palace? PASOK. Potami. And with the KKE, which came out through the representative of the General Secretary Dimitris Koutsoumbas, outside the Presidential Palace. And what did he say at that moment when the Greek people's no was overturned? What are you waiting for? It was logical. No denunciation of the overthrow of the people, not even by the representative of the Communist Party of Greece. Look at the first video on Youtube there is still there it is sad.
