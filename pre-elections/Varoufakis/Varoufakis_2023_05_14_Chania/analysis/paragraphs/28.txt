For 4 years now they have been saying that Varoufakis voted for a memorandum by the KKE, through the Guide, the Rizospastis. Koutsoumpas called me a Soros man. Something which I don't know if he himself understood, it started as a rumour from Golden Dawn and the fascist Stochos, the black and spidery newspaper of the Peloponnese. And then Stournaras had taken it and spread it and Koutsoubas took it afterwards. How do we react? We treat them as comrades. I'm coming out, I came out to the parliament. And I said about the Kasidiaris party. That the main reason we are voting against is that this amendment is the beginning of an effort and Tzimeros proved it the day after the communists were blocked. First the communists, then us. And what is it? It is an example of how untruthful the European Union is when every 23 August it lumps communists and Nazis together on that holiday against Nazism and communism, as if we did not know that if it had not been for the communists in the 1940s, the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals would have been Nazi. This is how we respond and this is how we will continue to step on the people of the KKE, even the leadership of the KKE, which is plaguing us, telling us mounds of the system, the familiar ones, heard that? We say to them. Comrades. If we do not succeed. To put a brake on the creepers of the oligarchy of the capital oligarchy of imperialism. We'll be in the same cells. We treat you as comrades. Whatever you do, we turn the other cheek.
