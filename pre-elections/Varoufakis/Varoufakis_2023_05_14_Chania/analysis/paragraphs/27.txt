We are the only ones who honour the simple proportional representation. We are not a JPC, we do not say that we have a monopoly on truth, wisdom and purity because we respect people who are locked into other parties. Who are pure. Who want what we want and we ultimately want, who vote for Tsipras to prevent Mitsotakis from coming out, who may still be locked in because they remember Andreas Papandreou in PASOK who is in KKE because they respect his history, as we respect it by the way.
