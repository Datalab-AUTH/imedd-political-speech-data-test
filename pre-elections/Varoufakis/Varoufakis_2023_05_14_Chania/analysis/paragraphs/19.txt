And this was passed on to us as a statute as a policy in the name of the radical left. A greater defeat for the international Left than that capitulation, the transformation of the brave NO of 62% of the Greek people into a YES to all this nonsense, to all these processes and to the mechanisms of plundering the many, has never happened where I go, whether I go to France or I go to Germany, whether I go to Cuba or I go to Mexico. Do you know what everyone is telling me? Our fellow travellers, our comrades there what was that which we all received together on that night of the referendum of 05/07/15 all the leftists, all the revolutionaries, all the progressives all over the world are crying even today, 7 years later, 8 years later for that crushing of the World Democratic Left of the World Struggle Left. That's why there is the Day 25 alliance for rupture. Because we cannot allow. In the name of the logic of the lesser evil, because there is no doubt. Syriza is a lesser evil than New Democracy, but yet this logic of the lesser evil leads to the greatest evil. Because the whole political scene is shifting further and further to the right. Space is created for fascism and Nazism when in the name of the Left you do something like this energy exchange in the name of the Left, not to mention Hercules.
