Have no doubt. This government? But also any coalition government with the memorandum parties PASOK and SYRIZA. It will be a disaster for Crete. Already published today in the international press the plans of the United States. For a partnership of Athens Ankara Cairo Egypt, Cyprus Israel and Cyprus. For a sequence of drilling operations targeting the population of Exxon Mobil, Total and Shell. Because all we will receive is pollution. The only thing we will collect is the police democracy that the drilling will bring, which is necessary in order to carry out the plundering not only of nature, not only of natural wealth, of the seas, but also of people, because the Greek State will not receive even 1 euro from this drilling.
