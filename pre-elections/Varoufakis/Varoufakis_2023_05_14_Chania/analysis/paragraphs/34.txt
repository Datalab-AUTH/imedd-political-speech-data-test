We are the only party that says neither Putin nor NATO.No more war. This war will only have losers. It is not a war of liberation for anyone. The Ukrainians have every right to resist when Putin's troops enter, but we Europeans are silencing ourselves with a war without end, and think of the cowardice. Think here, we are not talking about international brigades. It's like the Spanish Civil War where all the progressive people went to help the Republicans. The leftist socialists, communists, anarcho-syndicalists to win the war against Franco. Here they send weapons but they don't send troops. They want this war to continue until the last drop of Ukrainian blood.
