We are the only party, the only party that has a specific proposal for the Yperta Fund. Not just abolishing it, obviously. But to transfer the public assets from the Superfund to a, a new Development Bank and at the same time a new agricultural bank. We don't have the troika sold it, gave it to Sala, but it was taken by a common law criminal who took over Piraeus, Mr. John Paulsen. Transfer of public assets to these 2 banks, public banks as their new capital base to start flowing investment money to small and medium sized businesses and farmers. Specific proposal. That's why they hate us, because this specific proposal to anybody you say it to, whether they're a neo-democrat or a pasok or a Syriza, they will tell you it makes sense, it does. Have you heard about the Council of State that it once stood up and said NO to the privatisation of water and even demanded, and this is to their credit, that the shares of EYDAP and EYDATH, that is, the water supply and sewerage company of Attica on the one hand and Thessaloniki on the other, be transferred out of the State Treasury and go back to the public sector, quite rightly.
