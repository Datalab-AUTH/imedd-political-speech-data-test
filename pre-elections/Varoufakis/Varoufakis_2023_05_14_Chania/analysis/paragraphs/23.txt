We said if we don't sit down and talk so you don't talk to us later on about progressive governance and so on because progressive governance will do? You're up against Hercules, that market dream with the red loans. Do you know how long it took them to set this up 6 years the Frankfurt predators at the European Central Bank studied it, first they piloted it in Italy and then brought it here we what? From Monday morning until Wednesday afternoon we will agree on how to replace this Herculean dream of the Energy Exchange of the Super Fund. So when they tell us to come together in government, to get rid of Mitsotakis, do you know what they are saying? Come and legalise the grab. The plundering of people and nature in Greece, what does the leadership of Syriza tell us when they refer us to them after the elections? It says go to Chania, talk to the people and the youth. Talk to them about the abolition of the Energy Exchange. Talk to them about abolishing Hercules. Talk to them about the Demeter, which abolishes the fees that the bankers charge you to use your pensions, your salaries, to make payments to the shops. Talk to them about the need for no mining, not only in Crete, but also in Epirus, nor in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. Talk to them about reclaiming, which only in the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture we talk about, about creating a new Non-Aligned movement. No Putin, no NATO. Go to Cuba, go to Mexico, make these alliances, with Brazil, with President Lula. And then May 21 in the evening, maybe 22, on Monday, come and make me Prime Minister, make us Ministers, so we don't do any of this. That's what we're being told, do you realise that? They weren't slaughtered. We're not going to do that.
