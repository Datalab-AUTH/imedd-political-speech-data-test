A little while ago. I'm being interviewed for ERT, one of the questions they asked me. It was. Regarding the episode you heard in Kipseli that Mr. Kyriakos Mitsotakis. In his usual style. He was passing in front of the stalls from the booths of other parties, such as PASOK. SYRIZA. He greeted with his usual smile. And then he also went to the stand of the Mera 25 alliance for rupture, where our fellow comrade refused to shake his hand and I was asked the question. Is this political culture? Well, I will tell you that I answered. This is one of those times when the cadres, the members of the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture outperformed the leadership. Because I confess and I do so with a bit of self-criticism that I would have shaken his hand. Urban Residuals. The companion, the fellow traveler refused to shake his hand and so he put the glasses on me because at the same time.
