When they say but what are you talking about Varoufakis to reduce the 24% VAT by 15%. Europe will not let us. What Europe? In Germany as we speak the VAT is 19. So there is no European requirement to have 24% VAT. What we have is 100% prepaid tax. 100% prepayment does not exist in any other country in the European Union, not in any other country, so it is not a European cheque. It is a troika, it is a memorandum. When they threaten us that if you dare to reduce VAT and abolish prepayment of tax they will close your banks. This is the voice of the boss called the troika. The troika is supposed to be gone. When we say we're going to abolish the Super Fund. Think about it. Do you realise that there is no Super Fund in any country in the world, not in Europe. Do you realise that? All this fuss has been made and we thank the New Democracy trolls very much for making all this fuss about Demetra. One of the questions they asked me: Mr Varoufakis, is there anywhere else in Europe where Dimitra exists? The answer I gave them was: 'You are not telling me that there is no such thing as the Hermitage Fund anywhere else in Europe? There you have no problem doing innovative things. You say we can do them if they are plundering the Greek people because the Hyperfund is an innovation that exists only in Greece out of all the countries in the world, but they have no problem with it.
