Mitsotakis hasn't done it yet, he said, he will do what? The Council of State is imposing it on him. Do you know why he doesn't do it? Because he's waiting for the lenders to tell him no. These are our shares, they said, they're in our super fund. And they're looking for equivalents, friends. What does that mean they're going to give property that they haven't put in the Superfund yet to convince the lenders to say okay this is the equivalent of your water shares. Take it. We are under occupation at the behest of New Democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA who set up the Super Fund.
