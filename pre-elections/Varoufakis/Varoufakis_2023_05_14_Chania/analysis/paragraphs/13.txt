Superfund. If Hitler. saw what was going on with the Super Treasury, he would have been struck, he would have said, but I did the invasion of Crete, the battle of Crete, we were killed, he sent the Wehrmacht into mainland Greece. I could have sent the Troika to set up a Super Fund. The Wehrmacht never thought of setting up a Superfund, think about what a Superfund is. They set up a superfund, that's what they call it in English, and they put all the public property into it, whatever is left that they haven't already sold off. Beaches, archaeological sites, highways, infrastructure. Land, air, sea, everything in the Superfund. Okay, that in itself is not bad. You create a public body because it is officially a public body and you stuff all the public property into it. Yeah. But where does the fact that we are under occupation lie? The board of directors has a chairman of the Treasury. Who's going to appoint the chairman? The troika. It has a vice-chairman. Who appoints the vice-chairman? The troika. And what does the statute say that the Chairman and Vice Chairman decide everything and nothing can be decided without the Chairman and Vice Chairman. In other words, we are the only country on the planet, not in Europe, on the planet where public property is owned, by foreigners, by foreign conquerors. That's why I tell you Hitler will be beaten up, he tells you I've done nonsense. I didn't think of a troika. And a super fund.
