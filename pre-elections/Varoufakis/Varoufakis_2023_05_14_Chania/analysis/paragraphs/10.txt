This is where we will never forgive Alexis Alexis Tsipras for describing the possibility of an alternative reality as an illusion, because when this is done in the name of the radical left, the radical left has annihilated itself, comrades, comrades-in-arms. So does this narrative exist? That Greece is in a difficult situation there is no alternative we are in a sustainable stable situation compared to 2011 12 15. That things want to be managed within this what we call the European framework, which has nothing to do with Europe, it is the Troika framework, because what they call the European framework does not exist in Portugal it does not exist in Germany it only exists here in the Chreodoulo, Greece.
