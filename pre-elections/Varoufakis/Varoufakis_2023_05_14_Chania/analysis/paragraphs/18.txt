What did Stathakis and Co. do here? Build an energy exchange without a cap. Thatcher had put a cap to prevent the price of energy from rising here, says Stathakis, we will leave it to the market. What market, what stock exchange, comrades, what stock exchange? When you have Mytilineos, Vardinoyannis, Latsis, Peristeri and CVC. That's not a stock exchange, it's a caf√© of misfortune. 5 people sit around a table and do you know how they decide the price you pay for electricity? Says Pigeon's horde of doves. Guys, I say we give them 100 what do you say? 100 euros. What does Vardinoyannis say? Come on, you're too skinny, make it 150. Here comes Latsis, guys, nonsense. We have targets of 200. Here comes Mytilineos, who is a bit more wise, and who is usually a bit more awake, and we'll set it at 200, then they will die and it will be as if we have killed the cow that we want to milk tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Put it at 140. This is how they find this is the energy stock market of Georgios Stathakis and Alexios Tsipras.
