Friends and friends, fellow comrades, comrades-in-arms, comrades. The stakes of these elections. It is one, one and only. The many people out there, who are licking their wounds. Because even the supporters and voters of the New Democracy, most of whom are popular people who can't cope. And they're locked into the people's right, like the People's Party used to be, like the EPP used to be, like New Democracy is today. They have bought into the narrative. That things can be bad. But there is no alternative. There is no greater plague on a country that is not sustainable than this narrative no one says things are good, even those who vote for Mitsotakis. If you meet them on the street, you meet them here in Chania, they will tell you say leave it, I'm not coming out, I'm not coming out. What is this about taxes? With the tax prepayments, they have broken us up, the New Democrats themselves tell you. But here's the toxicity.
