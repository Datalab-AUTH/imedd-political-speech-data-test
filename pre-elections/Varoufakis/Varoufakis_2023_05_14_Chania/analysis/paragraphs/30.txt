Something that the guys who work at e Food, at Vault, at Skroutz live it. Every day you know that today the janitors, the most brutal janitors in the field of capitalist exploitation and work are not people, they are algorithms. Do you know how they are breaking the unions that are going to be born in the new technologies? Through algorithms. They know who is more prone to unionism and when they are motorbike deliveries, the algorithm is programmed to send them twice the distance in the rain, to deleverage. The algorithm doesn't do that, man does that. Which party has a view and position on the role played by a new form of capital that lives in the cloud, it's the computational cloud. Why? New forms of generalised exploitation are being created. Through new forms of capital based on digital technology.
