Energy Exchange. SYRIZA says that it will protect households from the excess profits of the PPC privatized by Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He says, we will nationalize it, he says by buying its shares. Are we going to go now? With the Greek people's money to take the shares from the predatory fund CVC, which has taken over PPC. And to do it first we have to give money to the predators, let's put that aside and do it what do we get? George Stathakis. My former colleague from the universities, my former comrade in arms of the Syriza government. He committed a crime when he introduced the energy exchange and presented it to the people of Chania to the people of Greece as a salvation because he says it will reduce the bills of the PPC. We have seen this dear George. What Stathakis and Tsipras did, under the orders of the Troika, of course, they did not think of this themselves, they just saved the country once again. By saying yes to everything. It is worse than what Margaret Thatcher did in Britain with the privatisation of the British power utility. Let us grasp this and let us not say that Varoufakis is a Thatcherite because he says that Tsipras and Stathakis' energy exchange was worse than Thatcher's.
