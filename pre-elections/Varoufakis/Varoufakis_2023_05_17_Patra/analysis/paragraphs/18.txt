We did not make the effort, the break. We tried to make it. They closed the banks and for a week they threatened the people with desertification if they dared to vote no, the people voted NO. The people did their duty, some people tell me now what are you trying to do, John, with the leftist and leftist parties and such here this people don't understand what this people don't understand. When it was needed, it stood up, as it stood up in 1941, as it stood up in 1973 at the Polytechnic, again with the young people and the young leaders, as it stood up in 2015 with 62% of the Greek people saying no to the Troika. The only debt we have is the debt of disobedience to be disobedient and selfless. These people show that when given the opportunity when they see selflessness coming to the forefront of government to work in their favour. This people forget both their selfishness and their misery. And all the evils of fate that our people have, all peoples have what to do? And they emerge as heroes and heroines. I will never forget the Friday night 03/07/2015 in Syntagma Square, in that magnificent gathering for the NO. Where I was caught with Danae we were caught with Danae we were caught by people in their 80s in their 90s, poor. And they told us, boy, I don't care about my pension, you have to bow down for my grandchildren. Don't back break and she won 62%. That break that 90 year old man and his wife who was the same age told me. That leads us today in Patras so many years after that break we put in the parliament in 2019 cowardly alone a handful of people almost accidentally kushuloi as the Cretans say. We have invested this break now with a coherent well-worked 100-day government programme with a coherent programme for the next 100 days. A truly radical overthrow of capitalist relations, of feudal relations of production in this country.
