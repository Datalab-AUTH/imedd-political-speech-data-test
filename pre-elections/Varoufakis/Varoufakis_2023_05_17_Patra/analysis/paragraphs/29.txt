 Just as we will make a break here, we will try to make a break everywhere. And if it works, if it doesn't work, ours will be the effort of our comrades in the rest of the European Union to overthrow this European Union. And you know what?Gandhi talked about disobedience so for peaceful disobedience, we will implement governmental disobedience. Our government, our government will be disobedient, they will veto one veto after another, they will create problems for them and we will say you don't like it, you get out of this thing called the European Union, I think that's the easiest way to build a broad popular majority for subversion both in Greece and outside of Greece. The significance of tonight for us here and for me personally is that all of this struggle that we are fighting at the European level at the national level and at the global level, because it's a great joy and honor that the Day 25 Alliance for Breakthrough is participating in the progressive international at Progressive International.
