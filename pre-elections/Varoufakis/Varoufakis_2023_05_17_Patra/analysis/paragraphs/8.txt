The future for you, the young people, is not what it was for us, for my generation. And this was taken care of by the domestic Troika, the foreign Troika, Pasok, New Democracy and Syriza. They have built black holes in the Greek social economy and whatever they do, the black holes suck all the energy, all the matter out of the lives of young people. If at 62 I care about this project. It is not for our generation our generation, we are defeated. Again and again. Post-political which of you do you remember? The expectations we had after 74 for real socialist change. Who of you remember the disappointments of the split? That tragic 90s, when everything was overturned and we went lifestyle in the dislocation of social, cultural, political, economic life. That's when the loans started to be built that set up that armored economy, which collapsed one by one so it was done by wall street and it all came crashing down. Our generation is the loser.
