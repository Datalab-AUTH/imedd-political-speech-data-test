Fotini Piliou Georgitsopoulos. Apostolis Triandopoulos. I have a request from you. Of course, your job is to go out, to convey this amazing atmosphere. This joyful news almost sounds Christian now so evangelist, but it is joyful news. We're all together again, we're going for the break, we're going for the overthrow, we're going for the resistance, we're going for the new great militant, selfless, disobedient disobedient left. The request. My plea to each and every one of you is to enjoy it. Because joy and truth are revolutionary, concepts, revolutionary forces. We must rejoice in it. What we do is not a chore. This axioms are extreme. Become deputies there to see what you have to eat. There is nothing that kills the soul of man more than being in Parliament, believe me truly. Believe me, it's unbelievable. But until you get there I want you to enjoy it and pass it on. No. Optimism, only idiots young optimistic hope. Hope that is revolutionary along with joy and of course truth. Thank you very much, we're moving on.
