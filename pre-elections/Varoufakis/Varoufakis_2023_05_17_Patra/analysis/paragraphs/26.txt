As far as the European Union is concerned, it is important to differentiate the European Union from the Eurozone, the Eurozone can be thrown out. Not legally. Illegal like Draghi did in 2015 when he closed your banks and then what do you do? You make your own currency outside the eurozone. This is clear, we don't mince words we say it, we are not proposing an exit from the euro, but we are ready for an exit from the euro. If it is a prerequisite for our country to become viable. From the European Union, however, they cannot be thrown out. There is no mechanism. This was demonstrated in the case of Britain's Brexit. They wanted to leave they wanted to be kicked out and they couldn't because it took them 5 years to do it. We will tell them we are not leaving, they have no mechanism to kick you out. You stay in and you make their lives unlivable. If you insist on European directives that are directed against your people, I think that is how you build a popular rallying cry and even an internationalist solidarity.
