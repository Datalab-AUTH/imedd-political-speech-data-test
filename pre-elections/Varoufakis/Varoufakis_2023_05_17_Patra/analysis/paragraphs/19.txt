Do you know of any other party that has a number of plans from institutions ready for legislation. A handful of MPs. We have lifted a huge burden. And I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about the comrades, the fellow travelers, those few who ultimately if you look at the legislative work they did is equivalent to, not to say greater than the 70 so many of Syriza. We are not starting from scratch. We have built a foundation stone. We have built it, and now it remains for these elections and the next ones, because we will certainly have second elections. You understand that on Sunday evening the real election campaign begins. This is a dress rehearsal to get fit, to warm up, and in a short while we will be back here in Patras and in all the cities. We will give it with great joy with a huge smile and the next race because let's not forget not to lose the sense of what is happening as we speak.
