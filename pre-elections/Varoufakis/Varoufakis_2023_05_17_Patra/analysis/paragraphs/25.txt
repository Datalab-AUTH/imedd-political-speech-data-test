At some point we will have to have the discussion post-election about what our position should be, and we may disagree there, so I don't know what you guys from the popular unity say, what the comrades from Trotskyist backgrounds say, what you guys from ARAS say. It will be an interesting discussion to have and I will tell you what I think. I think that the art of subversive politics, of radical politics is the art of creating a majority current among the have-nots among the victims of the oligarchy. That is the art right now of going to a farmer who gets two pennies from the common agricultural policy and saying we are going to leave the European Union. This is our stake stake stake is wrong. You're going to tell him what? I'm going to abolish the energy exchange that squeezes what little money you have left. I'll abolish Hercules where the servers call you and humiliate you every day. I will move VAT from 24 to 15% and all essentials to 0%. That's what I'm going to do. Are we all going to go together and have a shower at the doors and windows of power to do these things? When the representatives of the oligarchy without borders come. The domestic troika, but with what you're doing, they'll close your banks. You know what you say, then let them work their asses off. So you build an alliance not only for the break between us, but a broad popular majority for the stakes of the break.
