But don't say it too much, I have told the channels, you don't say that. Tell me, do you hear me? They come, they get a loan. A man who's in debt, who's in debt. Because of the 100,000-dollar crisis, he takes it for three grand. He's got the house on 50, he's got 3, he's got 47. Is that capitalism? That's a primitive form of exploitation.
