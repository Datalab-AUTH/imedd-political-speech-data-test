Good evening to all of you I'm not sure if the weather has spoiled us or if the weather has spoiled us because we're not outside, but on the other hand we're in a beautiful place. We are all together I see a lot of new faces I see some old faces from the old series from DIEM 25, pre day 25. It is a great pleasure to be in Patras with Danae, with all of us who came from Athens from outside of Achaia to come and meet with you. I will be a candidate in Achaia. I'm not saying this because I'm asking for a cross, don't cross me, I'll be a loser. We have a feudal system in Greek elections. The leader doesn't want a cross, so don't waste a cross on me. But let me explain why I'm running in Achaia. You know that party leaders have to choose 3 districts. I have chosen A Athens to symbolize that what to do when you want to overthrow the Roman Empire you have to start starting from Rome. So as we started DIEM 25 in Berlin we had to run in A Athens. I come down to B Piraeus because it is a proletarian area which is in the process of de-industrialization and the transformation of the proletariat of Nice of Drapetsona of Keratsini, of Nice of Perama into a precariat is something that you know, especially you, the young people, that is at the center of the reflection of DIEM 25 alliance for rupture. And I am coming down here because Patras symbolizes a number of things.
