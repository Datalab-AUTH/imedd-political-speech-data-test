The European Parliament is a nonsense; if you want to destroy me, send me to the European Parliament. I'd be bored, I might even kill myself out of boredom. So there is no European Parliament. The European Parliament is what Keynes says it is.
a job-creation mechanism for very well-paid jobs. This is a Keynesian policy. It is the only parliament in the world that cannot legislate. Do you know that? You tell anyone that I bet no one knows that, they don't have the right to legislate. It's a fig leaf. We will not change, we will not overthrow the European Union through the European Parliament.
