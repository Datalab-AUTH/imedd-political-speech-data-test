He put us hand and foot in the prison of debt from beautiful sunny Castelorizo. And he saved us, the first saviour for you think about it. He took 110 billion loan is the biggest loan in human history. I'm not exaggerating. Look it up. Has there ever been a loan bigger than 110 billion? Never in history and I'm not talking in proportion to GDP and such in absolute terms. No country had ever taken 110 billion loans from anybody ever it was never for us of course. They went to the Treasury and went to Deutsche Bank, Societe General so that those banks would not collapse. And on terms of course what are the terms? Imagine if a friend of yours came to you and said you know what? I have a loan, I can't pay it because my salary has been reduced, but a banker comes and gives me a credit card to draw at a high interest rate, pretend to pay it, but then he puts a limit on it. I'll take a cut. 28% of my income not enough to pay off the loan will be reduced to 8% through austerity to give you a credit card to get you into more debt. If you hated this friend, but you had to hate him too much, but you must have been very cruel people to say take it, they took it and we have been handcuffed ever since
