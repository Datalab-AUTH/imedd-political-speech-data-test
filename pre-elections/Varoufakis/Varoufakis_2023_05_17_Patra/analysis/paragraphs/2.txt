It symbolizes lost opportunities and the first industrial revolution that began with the raisin era. The first proletariat in Southern Greece. Because I don't want to talk about Thessaloniki which has a different story. The first bourgeoisie that was born here. The first conflict in the context of a modern class struggle starts here. It is a port that connects Greece, the Middle East, the Near East, with Italy, with Europe, with the rest of the Mediterranean with Central Europe. It is the place where you see the former industrial zone withering away. And you wonder. How is it possible? So many billions in Mediterranean integrated programs. In Delore Santer packages and a bad bunch of NSRFs in recovery funds and you go to the industrial zone and see this beautiful landscape of collapse, but without a plan, without a new development plan, no development plan, no development plan What did they do they gave it to TAIPED which passed it on to the Hyperfund. And what are they doing? Third world stuff. Yes, there is a motorway with its toll, which they have sold. The next 50 years of tolls have already been sold. You know that, right? There is no such thing as a decent train. And if there is one, it stops here, it doesn't go any further. The port is deteriorating. It's dying every day, the port doesn't exist, the port of Patras is not what it was when I was growing up.
