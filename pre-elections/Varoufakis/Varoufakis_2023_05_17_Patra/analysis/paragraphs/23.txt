Now of course I'm doing my own self-criticism and saying that we should have made this mistake now, we will not make this mistake and we will not negotiate with anyone. We will legislate what we have to legislate. Nor, of course, will we hide from the people that a break can also mean leaving the euro, not the European Union. Not from the European Union, not because we love the European Union. But because we will do them a favour? To leave the European Union means they will stay and leave. Let them leave.
