Social democracy is dead and will never be reborn. What was happening in Germany under Billy Brandt in the late 60s and in the 70s under Bruno Krzysztynski in Austria. Under Labour in Britain. Social housing, a redistribution of wealth of income with strong unions. With social democratic governments acting as an arbiter between capital and the proletariat of the organised proletariat through the unions. Even here in Greece where there was a redistribution of income, as was done in 1981 by the first PASOK government. These are over and done with, because at the moment there is no sovereign state. Constantine Karamanlis, with all the bad things going wrong, had powers. He decided things at some point and was accused of socialism in 1977 to nationalize some banks. His android for anyone who remembers back then. So he decided to take the country out of NATO on the military side, when the Turks got into Cyprus, he had some powers, he did some things. Today the dummies that rule us, whether they are pink or green or purple what is blue. I wish they were purple, black is blue. They don't even have power, they have chairs. They can redistribute loot annuities to their company, but what Karamanlis did, old Papandreou did, they don't have the power to do. Do you know why? Because they handed it over. When all that debt was built, by entering the eurozone. And now because we're a little bit in the auditorium I'm not going to say things I would say in the square I'm going to make it a little bit more academic do you mind? It's very simple.
