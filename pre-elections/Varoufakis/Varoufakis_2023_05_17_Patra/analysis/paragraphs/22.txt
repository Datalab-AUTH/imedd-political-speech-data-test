We admit these things, we don't say, this mistake that 15 and I made, self-criticism here now, so. We did not prepare the Greek people, the people knew it and were behind us. We didn't prepare them by telling them exactly what rupture means. I didn't talk about the parallel payment system that has now become a hangman's noose. I did not talk about how we were going to stop the closure of the banks, threatening Draghi that if he closed them down we would cut the bonds he held were Greek law and would create a huge problem for him with Italy. I was keeping these as papers. Hoping that I will have the support of Alexis Tsipras to use them at the right time, as when you are in battle, you start in battle, you don't reveal your weapons to the enemy. But since Alexis Tsipras did not intend to fight this battle, but he wanted one thing, how not to fight this battle, how to stop me from using these weapons.
