In 2015, this brave people against an oligarchy that told them that we were in cahoots, that mocked them for all the loans taken by the oligarchy. It was terrorizing him with Armageddon if he dared to rise up, this people rose up. Don't forget that with Syriza we started it, we had a 4%. So a little parenthesis. All serious projects the big shooting starts as small when I tell you that we are laying the foundations. for the new big left that will govern this country, with you young people in the vanguard. I am speaking absolutely realistically, as long as we believe it and as long as we sweat the jersey of the day 25 alliance for rupture as long as we bleed it, as long as we give the fight, the good we can free ourselves. I close the parenthesis. The people in 15 were ahead, they were way ahead of the leadership. Our people went from 4 to 36%.
