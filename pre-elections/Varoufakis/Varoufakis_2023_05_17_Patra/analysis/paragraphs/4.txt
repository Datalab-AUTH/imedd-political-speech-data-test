Of course, you see, we built a pharaonic, very beautiful, aesthetically pleasing bridge over the Rio Antirrio, but we forgot to put a train on it. We forgot that, I don't know how Mr Simitis missed it. Did he? Is there a plan for the train linking the Peloponnese with Epirus? No plan, as if there would be a plan when they broke up the OSE and locked up the trains in the Peloponnese. That is to say, think about every last year and better as far as the railways and infrastructure are concerned. The bourgeois reproduction of capital accumulation if you look at it from the point of view of capitalism.
