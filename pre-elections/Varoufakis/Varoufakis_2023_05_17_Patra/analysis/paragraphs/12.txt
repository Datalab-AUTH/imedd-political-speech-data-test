So they found us and the Portuguese and the Spanish and the Spaniards and the Italians in southern Italy and the Irish and they were a bargain, they have no debt. They have houses we'll take their houses if they don't pay the debts but we'll lend them money and we'll make money while they pay us back and we'll take them into the houses, they can't pay us back. That's the way HYPERImperialism works in the Eurozone within the European Union. With the same currency. And now when they all start to go bankrupt, because the German banks went bankrupt too. Why? They went bankrupt for the simple reason that they made all these funny bets on the United States, but I'm not going to get into that story.
