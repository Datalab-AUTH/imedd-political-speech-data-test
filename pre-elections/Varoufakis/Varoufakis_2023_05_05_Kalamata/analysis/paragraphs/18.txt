There is no rule of the European Union, no treaty of the European Union that is consistent with these memorandum commitments, they say, we cannot reduce VAT from 24 to 15%. Europe will not let us. Who is Europe? The European treaties are nothing for VAT. They are clear that VAT is a matter for the national government. What are they saying, we are not left by the troika that is supposed to have left and only some obsessed oddballs like Varoufakis continue to say so? We will legislate what we have a duty to do. For the Greek people to breathe a sigh of relief so that this society can become viable again. Now? Between us. If some people come, whether they are from Frankfurt or aliens. and tell us that if you legislate what you have to legislate, we will close your banks. Because you know we don't mince words. We don't mince our words, they closed them down once, I'll close them down. I don't believe it. That they'll necessarily close it again. In fact, I don't think they'll dare to do it again. Especially if we have a truly militant government of the left. But after all, why are we here? All for the euro; or all for the Greeks. We don't. We claim there won't be a cost from such a break. The rupture is no walk in the park. Just as the NO on 28/10/1940 was not a walk in the park, the Greek people believed that saying no would be glorified in history and there would be no cost. The revolt against the colonels at the Polytechnic. The students who did it at the Polytechnic believed that they would be glorified by history at no cost. What does virtue and daring mean? According to Calvo, whatever freedom wants. Cost.
