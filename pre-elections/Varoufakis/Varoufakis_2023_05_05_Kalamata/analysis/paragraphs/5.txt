In this context I want to welcome. The internationalists, the patriots. The international 3 patriots who in this village in this city. In this district you will fight the fight. I have my card so I don't make any mistakes. Petroulla Dulami. Our Petroulla. I know her, Dora Theodoropoulou. Get upstairs. Usual suspects for day 25. George Kanellis. George. Vassilis Kyvelos. Hello, Vassilis. Maria Mitsi. Is Jason Bakas with us or not? He's not with us, Bakas will be. And Yiota Christopoulou, Yiota, Panagiota Christopoulou. Here these are our people in Messinia, it's a difficult region of Messinia, who wants to learn from the younger of you. What did it mean to be a leftist in this region? Let him read the Dead Division, the first and second volumes to see why the region is so far right, why the Leftists were wiped out in 1949 from this region from Messinia, from Sparta in general from the Peloponnese. Heroes, the Leftists who remained correct and even more heroes when after the great victory of the people on 05/07/2015 and after the capitulation of our own party. Again in the struggle, because every generation anyway. Again this is a message to the young people. We were the new generation doomed, like the previous generations, to fight the same fight again and again and again the same fight. That is how history goes forward. Thank you very much for a very good fight.
