Rupture wants you to be ready to pay in costs and you know what? If you're ready to make the break and the cost is minimized. The only cost that increases forever is the cost of the yesman. That says yes to everything. Who tries to give credentials to Solts to Vardinoyannis, to Latsis, to Turna, to Mytileneus, to Alafouzos and of course today. And look at the channels at Marinakis. We. We look at them and say. Strike. Because as long as you strike, it means we are doing the right thing. First break. Because it's a prerequisite to freeing this country to become a viable country, to not lose the rest of our children. If we say yes to everything all the time as we have been saying for so many years a few will leave a few will become a Kosovo with nice beaches. Whoever goes to Kosovo, what will they see? A country country region say what you want. No youth, only old people. Do they have EURO? You know if you go to Pristina and put your Piraeus National Bank card in an ATM and pull out â‚¬50 you will get Euros.Enjoy. Let them enjoy it.
