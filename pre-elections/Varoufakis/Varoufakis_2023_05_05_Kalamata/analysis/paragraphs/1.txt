Not even rain can save him. The mnemonics. I'm glad to see you. It would be nicer in the square. That's all right. We'll be here in a month. It's a marathon for us, for the left. Elections are a pretext. It's a means, not an end in itself. It is our goal and I am really very happy to see us here united frontally all together.We started on day 25. The comrades of popular unity. Non-attached of the left non-attached of the movements who finally all join in this common struggle. It is a great joy after 2015 that our roads have. Reunited. And where? It shows. On their own; they are disengaged by our presence in the electoral struggle, by the fact that they did not like the predictions that the militant, disobedient, disobedient, selfless left will not only not exist in Parliament again, but we will use it. The electoral process with one election, two elections, three elections, 300 elections. We are not interested in building the great left, the great selfless left. Non-compromising left that this people need. And which really is the nightmare. Of the oligarchy's power brokers. It is. These are important days because we are all the losers of the referendum, the defeated. Invincible losers.
