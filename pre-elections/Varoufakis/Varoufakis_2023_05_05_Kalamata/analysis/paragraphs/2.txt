When our own faction. Took that magnificent OXI of the Greek people's resistance and overturned it. To come together again. To give the people breath again. And to do it again as we do it again as day 25 alliance for rupture to believe that the political parliamentary process can lead again. In a vision of government, comrades, fellow travellers, friends, we do not. We will settle for a 3, 4, 5, 6%. Our goal is to create the prospect of subversion and reversal. It means taking power into the hands of the people, not ours; that is the stakes for us. It is a very long road, but it will be a very, very beautiful road and I look forward to walking it together all together starting from Kalamata tonight.
