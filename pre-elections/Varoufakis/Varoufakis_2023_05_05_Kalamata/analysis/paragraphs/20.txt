It is not only a prerequisite for the sustainability of the country and for. And for ending desertification the rupture. It is a prerequisite. In order to be able to think. First. a technologically advanced Greece. based on its own technological strengths. gave an example before with green hydrogen. To be able to answer the question of what this country will produce that will be competitive in the global economy, in the global division of labor and. We are not leftists. Because we believe there is a better capitalism. We are leftists because we believe that capitalism produces crises like it produces iphones. From the same production belt and that the more. It fades, or they fade. They make the workers a precariat; they dismantle their labor rights, they reduce wages, they reduce the percentage of the pie that goes to the working class, to the working people, to the small and middle class, to the young, to young women, the bigger the crisis of capitalism, because then there is no money to buy the products that the idle factories produce. This is what it means to be a leftist. Capitalism. It's there. At a stage of fragmentation fragmentation to me it's not even capitalism, it's a new form of feudalism. Which is even digital feudalism. This is a theoretical discussion. It is not for now. We are clearly talking about the technologically advanced self-managed socialism of the future. Only then can everything be done differently, but the first break is the first stage. Of its conviction and programming everything can be otherwise. Thank you very much. Moving on, we have 2 elections, power. Come on over the candidates or candidates or candidates. What?
