And know that after the elections, when we have proven that we are here for the people, not for the offices. When we have proven that this night has lasted too long and the light is coming, the light of resistance, others will join us. Others who are hesitant will come. Are they still telling you now what they will do in coalition with Tsipras? No, we will not join the government with Tsipras. We know that, but there are some who don't know it yet. I can't believe he's telling you, he can't some ministry will lure them, he won't lure us ministry Here you are here, I am. There is no possibility of us getting into a race for ministerial cars, for posts and for this game of so-called realism. The only realism is resistance until a governmental perspective for disobedience, for insubordination is created.
