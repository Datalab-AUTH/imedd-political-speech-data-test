Elections. Every election process. It raises a big question. Depending on the times, one was 1981, one was 1991, one was 2010 11. 12 those 3 elections were held together. Today let me. I am conveying to you my assessment of what is the key question and I am not talking now about us we know. We know what our goal is, we know what our analysis is, but for the people out there. The big question that I would ask someone or someone who is not affiliated with a party, who may not even consider voting for us. And. looking for what to throw on the ballot box?What I would say to them is this. There are 2 narratives. For our country there are 2 narratives in our country right now. The dominant narratives. One is. That. This country is sustainable. This society is viable, with its problems, with its difficulties. It has a European framework, that's what the channels and the media are saying. The parties of the mendicant parties; it has some agreements and commitments in Brussels in NATO. In the global power structure, but. We are no longer under the memoranda, that's not what they say. And within that European and American-driven they say it globally. Framework. It's in our hands in the hands of the Greek parliamentary process of the institutions of our state, whether it's the government, whether it's the ADAE, whether it's the courts of the institutions, our own. Shall we get our act together? Let's pull ourselves together; and let's do well. That is the dominant narrative.
