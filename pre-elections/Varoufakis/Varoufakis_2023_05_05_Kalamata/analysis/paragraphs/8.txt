They will never get their money back. When they gave us 110 billion in 2010, first memorandum, 130 billion in the second memorandum, 86 billion in the third memorandum, in the fourth memorandum they basically took away 110 more in August 18 They didn't give us money, what are they doing? They suspended payments. It doesn't matter if you owe money. They either give you more money to pay back or they suspend payments. it's the same thing. It was a memorandum loan. All of this is on the basis of what we in day 25 have always called debt servitude. Which according to our manifesto When we were founded in 2018 we said debt serfdom, because it's a problem because it leads to desertification The reason our children are leaving is that. They are joining a debt prison and it's not just the national debt. What happened in 2018 17 18 with the fourth memorandum. It was, something that will go down in history. Of international capitalism as an incredible first. look, remember in 2010 11 12 13 pretty much everybody was losing except for Sallas of Piraeus and some other crows who had a chunk of the memorandum loans going into their pockets, but even the bourgeoisie. Who had property in Kifissia of Athens in Kolonaki, even they may have had property, apartments, villas, bad they had no money, they had no cash, they were in trouble, they couldn't rent, they could sell. They lost almost all 99% of the Greek people from 2010 to 2017 18 they lost. From 2018 onwards they found ways of 20% of the Greek people. The occupiers, the oligarchs and their employees I'll put it simply. All of these sectors of activity, whether business consultants, were the brokers. The film law firms involved in PPPs in all these parties of the memorandum process. That 20%. It's doing better from 2018 to date than it ever has. That's why they applaud the troika that's why they applaud. Any government that passes these memorandums that desertify our country and our people, our young people; abroad.
