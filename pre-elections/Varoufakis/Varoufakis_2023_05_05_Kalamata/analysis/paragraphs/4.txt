Our movement, which should give power to those who do not have it. Who are the many? The overwhelming majority because what we have is certainly not a democracy. It is very, very good that we can speak without being booed. It's too good that we can vote; it's too good, they have generations. Sacrificed to have the right to this process of bourgeois democracy, but it is not democracy. Democracy means. To be able the majority to rule for themselves and not to be in the state. Of complete occupation and dependencies on foreign and local oligarchic interests. In this struggle. Which struggle is it? In the Peloponnese, in Greece, in Europe, we have here comrades from Berlin who have come today to support us in the context of the progressive international, whether it is in Brazil or in Nigeria, whether it is in Germany itself or in the whole of Africa. We. We know how to fight the struggle in parallel. In our village, in our neighborhood, in our city and in the whole planet at the same time. Because that's what a leftist means. That's what it means to be a patriot to be an internationalist.
