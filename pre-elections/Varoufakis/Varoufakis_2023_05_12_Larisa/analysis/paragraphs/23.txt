No one mentioned the lawsuit that he filed against Kleon so look at it, we love it back to the we, we want their hate, their hate means we're doing what we have to do for the many, for the workers, for all of them. The young, especially the women of all those. Who are having your lives plundered every day. The struggle against the oligarchy is not a walk in the park. Breaking up is not a walk in the park, it comes at a cost. We wish we didn't have to. To write our books? We'd like to hang out together. Have a drink together. We would very much like to live a normal life, but there is no such option because if there is no rupture with all the things I have listed today this country will become a Kosovo with beautiful beaches and mountain tops. Because I am talking about Kosovo, if you go to Kosovo, what will you see? A place without youth, everyone has left, everyone has left only old people. Go to Pristina put your debit card from the highway from the gallery in an ATM will you get out? Euros, they have Euros. They have no future. There goes Greece. If we care about this place. If. We feel the political, moral and cultural and historical responsibility. To make it viable again because this place is not viable for the reasons I have already described. We have a sacred obligation to stand all together to set aside bitterness, to work for the true unity of the left, of movements, of progress through the rupture unity to become ministers better, to die. Unity to do the rupture, we will die for it. We will give everything we have and we don't have against Marinakis against Mytilene against Alafouzos against all those who darken the minds of the Greek women who darken the minds of the Greeks.
