A little side note here. Hey, look, we understand why they hate us if you're a banker, you hear that and you have a stroke. Stroke destroys the business model they say because they're the only way these banks are going to make money the only way these banks are making money they're not lending anyway. You know, do you know of any small business people who got a loan from a business bank? They only lend to their own people. So they eat each other out of you, they eat the graft. So when they hear the Demetra system they go crazy they run amok with hatred towards the day 25 alliance for the breakup. When Mitsotakis SA hears about abolishing Hercules and creating Odysseus. Abolition of the Yperth Fund. And transfer of the Yperth Fund assets to a new development bank and a new agricultural bank as a capital base to have a public banking system to give credit to the small and medium sized businesses and farmers go crazy, is what they will do.
