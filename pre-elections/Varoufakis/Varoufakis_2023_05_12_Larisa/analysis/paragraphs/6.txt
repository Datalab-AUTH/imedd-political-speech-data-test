Things are changing. With the third memorandum. The radical left in quotation marks. And the fourth, the third one, remember, was after the capitulation to the conversion of the NO into a yes. The fourth memorandum was in the summer of August 2018. What happens now? With the memoranda of the Left, the so-called Left, 20% of the Greek people are receiving incomes and benefits that they have never seen before in their history. They are doing very, very well. The 80% are under conditions of plunder. What the memoranda under SYRIZA have done is that they have created a process of plundering of the many which, my friends, fellow comrades, is the only one in the history of humanity. This does not exist in any other country. That is, imperialism was once honest. Spanish conquistadors went to Mexico, killed, took the gold, took it to Spain. That was honest. It was clear, there was no choice. Then comes capitalist imperialism. As we know from Luxemburg from Lenin, what happens? The capitalist economies of Britain, Germany, France, later, Japan. They have heavy industry factories that produce far more products than the economy itself can absorb. Because because the workers had no wages, they had minimum wages, so the factories produced products that the proletariat can't buy. And what they did they had to find markets abroad. Imperialism. This is the wave that led to the First World War. It becomes more complicated imperialism. It's not as pure and simple as that of the Roman Empire or the Spanish.
