Shall we go to the second one? Energy Exchange. I really never thought there would be such a thing. Why? My first intense political encounters, participation in demonstrations, beatings by mounted police, sadness that we were losing the movements trade unionists were in England. Because from the age of 17 I went to England. I experienced Thatcherism in its entirety, I got it in the face as they say. Thatcher was better than them. Now the KKE will take that and say Varoufakis is a Thatcherite. That's not what I mean. I mean she's even worse than Thatcher let me explain that to you. In the context of the energy exchange. Do you know how Thatcher privatized the British power utility? She went to the British citizens who had no desire to privatise the PPP. It was fine the British PPP worked very well. I had a problem.But he says this, because they were clever, he'll say to them, "Look what we're going to do, what's the price of a kilowatt hour. 50. 50. Okay, I promise you I'm going to legislate that it will never go over 50. I'm going to break the PPP into pieces, I'm going to sell the different pieces to different private parties, I'm going to put other private parties in. But cap it at 50. What it is today and I'll make a sort of stock exchange in a pseudo market to compete with each other until the price drops below 50. Do you have a problem with that? 50 you pay now 50 you pay max. If the private market I create goes below 50, what do you have to lose? Not only that, but you know what he did? How she got along on a plate as she mocked it. When he did the privatization, he didn't sell it to this hedge fund, a predatory fund, like Mitsotakis did.
