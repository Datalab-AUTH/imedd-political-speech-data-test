Here's the little PPC in this unacceptable CVC. Right? Who took our hydroelectric projects, took the wind turbines, took all of PPC. So between the two of them, there was a price to pay. It's a big chunk, it went to the troika. That's what Mitsotakis did. Thatcher was smarter than that. What did she do? She told the world. No one will be able to buy more than 1000 euros of stock. I don't want the predators to get it. I want people's capitalism. Come on, find 1000 euros, borrow it, buy shares and become a shareholder, so I'm transferring it to the public. Electricity to the people. And what did he do? He was selling these shares at a cut price, so that the proletarian, the middle-class, the shopkeeper would know that he would pay €1000 to get a share in the privatised British PPP and tomorrow he could sell it for €2000 and that's how it happened. They made money. What was the result of course? That the big predators bought like a vacuum cleaner sucked up all those shares and now the British are suffering and paying. They are also paying gratuities like we are, but Thatcher also put a cap on the price of electricity. What did they do?
