So say the parties of the progressive arc: PASOK, Syriza. PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK, PASOK. Did you see their excess profits? There is nothing easier than the CVC. There's no easier thing than CVC hiding the profits of PPC. You know how they do it? CVC has 220 companies. I studied it, I looked it up. Worldwide. Mostly based in Luxembourg, some in Ireland, some in Jersey, a little island between Britain, well. One of them is PPC. You know, if he wants to, if he wants to say I don't make any profit and he makes a profit of 10 billion. I'm saying now that's how they make up numbers. So in my mind it's a 10 billion profit. Before he declares it, he knows what he's doing. He has a company called Fufutos in Luxembourg. It's also a CVC company. What does it produce? Seaweed and silk ribbons, it doesn't matter. The company, after he wipes it out of Luxembourg. It draws a piece of paper. A caricature, a computer code. So a code they say. He sells it to PPC. For 10 billion. Who stops him on the open market? Immediately. PPC doesn't make a profit. How, Mr. Tsipras, how, Mr. Androulakis, will you tax its excess profits or when CVC decides what profits to declare? So one way is to abolish the energy exchange, a 5% cap. The top above the average cost of producing and distributing electricity and over time. In the medium term, not the long term. Nationalisation and re-establishment of a single public power utility, which will be socialised and control of which will pass to local communities.
