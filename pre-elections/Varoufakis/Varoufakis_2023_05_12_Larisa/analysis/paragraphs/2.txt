We are here, Day 25 Alliance for Rupture, all those who in 2015 stood up in front of the hell of capitulation, in front of those who in 2015 stood up in front of a real necessary struggle of the Greek people, a brave no when all of you rose up against the channels of the interconnectedness, against the terrorism of Mario Draghi, Mega, Antenna, the whole system. You stood up and said oh. That night. They did it yes. Unfortunately, and I'm also making a self-criticism and I think we all are. We didn't get to stand up and rally. To become a fist, to go against both our former comrades and the entire memorandum meme establishment. That is why it is a great joy now because we are together again. Because after the first consultative congress of Mera 25 we proved that we did not enter parliament to take a position. We entered the parliament to be the catalyst for this convergence, not only with Hera, but with the comrades of popular unity that I see you here with comrades who are not in popular unity who are not in Mera who are non-aligned of the left, of the water movements. Of the movements for wind turbines on the mountain tops for the Acheloos. For the immigrants, for all the things that are hurting this country and ultimately making it unsustainable.
