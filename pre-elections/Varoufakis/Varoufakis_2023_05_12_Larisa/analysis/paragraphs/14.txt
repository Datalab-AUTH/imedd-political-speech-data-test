Stathakis. My colleague. Not to say we were friends. From university. He was on the seventh floor of the Ministry of the building with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy. I live on the sixth the Minister of Development and I downstairs when I left boomeranged privatization. And the creation of the energy exchange and he comes out with Alexis Tsipras and they tell you guys energy exchange will drop prices? But they didn't put a cap on it. That's why I'm telling you, they were worse than Thatcher. What they said is the market says it will set the price itself. What market? The energy exchange is not an energy exchange. It's a coffee shop. Five. It is: Vardinoyannis, Latsis, Peristeri, Mytilineos and CVC, that hedge fund, the predatory fund if you put five people in one. Coffee shop. And you tell them you make the price. Do you know how you decide the price of wholesale energy? Vardinoyannis' horde comes in, I say randomly so and says to Latsis' horde, I say let's give them 100 price. Vardinoyannis' lady says, because you're too skinny, put 200. Latsis comes back and says, are you crazy? 250. Mytilineos comes back, he's a bit smarter. Nonsense, if we give them 250, they'll die. It's like a cow, if you kill it, there's no milk. Put 190. They find it, they cook it and they decide. That's how the price of electricity is decided every day. That's the energy exchange.
