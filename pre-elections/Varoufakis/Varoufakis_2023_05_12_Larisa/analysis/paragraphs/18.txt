The banks controlled. In the context of this knitting how shall we put it? This thread, which has tied up all the pieces of the mechanism for the plundering of Greek women and men. The banks that we are talking about at this moment. We have the highest rate of exploitation of depositor customers. In Europe. Check it out to see. When you put 1,000 euros in the bank? You get an interest rate of 0.04, which is zero. If they lend you money. It's a minimum of 8% and if it's a credit card it's 24 regular usury. That's the difference? Interest rate on deposits. And loan rates are the highest in Europe. This is money that goes into your pockets. The banks here are the paradox - I won't bore you with the technicalities - they are bankrupt and at the same time they are over-profitable. This is a unique. Paradoxical, paradoxical situation, but in this process, apart from that, apart from the fact that they are robbing you, why don't they give you interest when you have 1000€, 5000€ in the bank? And they give you when you owe, whether it's a red loan or a black loan. The loan is brown loan or green loan. Beyond that. When you go to get one? Anything a food from a restaurant. A chocolate. From a kiosk. And you pay with your debit card the shopkeeper's face darkens because the bank? They'll put a charge on him and take what I earn. He had from that particular transaction. 2 billion a year we as Greek people give to the banks for digital transactions and think about it we give 5 5 half for education. And we give 2 billion to these predatory funds that have taken over the former Greek banks. So that, so that, so that you can use your pensions and your pension goes into one of these accounts. Your salary goes into one of those accounts to go to pay. When the transaction cost is zero, it takes you 2 billion. Total nationally. Why? Do we owe them? Do we have a surplus?
