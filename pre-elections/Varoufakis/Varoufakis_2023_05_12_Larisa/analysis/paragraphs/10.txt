Well, look at the debate the other day. In a passage from his speech, the former comrade and former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, when asked about progressive governments and so on, said something that I liked. He said, he said, that what matters is the unity of the left. Did you hear that? Who would disagree? Will anyone disagree? Unity is everything. United we stand, divided, fragmented. We are defeated. Is there any doubt about that? That's why I'm so happy to see the People's Unity flags next to the Day 25 flags. Because we are united in action. Mr. Tsipras, what do you mean when you say unity of the left? For what we just said about Hercules, what are we going to do about it right now, you know? To raise your hand, because you have red loans. Yes, well, you know what humiliation means? You are called on the phone and humiliated every day by the crows, the predators who want to take fortunes from this country. And I'm not just talking about the issue of social inequality. It's not just taking it from the poor and going to the rich. They're going to take it to the Cayman Islands, they're not even going to eat it in the boomtowns here in Larissa to circulate some money in the area. They'll take it to the Bahamas to eat it with credit cards from Cayman Islands. Mr. Tsipras, what unity are we going to have on this? Are we going to abolish Hercules? Says SYRIZA, I read everyone's programs very carefully. He says, the first thing we're going to do is a PNA, a legislative act to abolish, he says, put a brake on all auctions for six months. And then. Thank you. Thank you. All together, guys. Varoufakis has no value on his own nothing I do nothing.
