Those are the three geese that lay the golden eggs, but I'll say a few words about the banks. The banks, as you know, are no longer Greek. Ethniki SA and Piraeus are now owned by predatory funds. There is a thin thread. That connects. It runs through all forms of plunder. The same funds own the PPC, have bought private clinics, such as Health, the metropolitan. I want to buy more. By closing down the NHS you buy colleges from the ones Kerameos is subsidizing. With the minimum admissions base with police democracy, with underfunding of our universities, our schools. This same fine thread of plunder still runs through. And of course the banks and predatory funds. Every public-private partnership. Because these PPPs are not partnerships, they are essentially subjugation of the public sector to the private sector. The state guarantees profits to the private party, who may have a fund who may have a college, who may have a power generation or distribution plant. It is this thread that has tied the Greeks hand and foot. It is, of course, permeating the media of mass deception.
