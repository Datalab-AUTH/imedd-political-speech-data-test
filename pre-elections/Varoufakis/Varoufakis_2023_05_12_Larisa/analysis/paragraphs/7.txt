Here in Greece. They've found the combination of the memorandum parties of the European Central Bank, the European support mechanism. Big deal about support. Brussels' have found something that is unique, which is that if we weren't suffering so much, we should be applauding them for how imaginative they are. Notice my thought, there are 3 mechanisms that are unique in the history of capitalism, of humanity. First: Hercules, the red loan market. We have a bankrupt people, leave the state that is bankrupt. We have, according to official figures, 2 million properties that are red loans, they are included as collateral in red loans. So, let's say it's one property per family, we have 2 million Greeks who are currently on red loans.
