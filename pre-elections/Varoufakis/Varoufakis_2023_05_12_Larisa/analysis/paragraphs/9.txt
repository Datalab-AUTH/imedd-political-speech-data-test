Friends, compañeras and compañeros. Fellow travellers, I will say something and tell me if it is sophisticated and far-fetched. I do not believe it is. The Wehrmacht did not manage to do this. During the occupation the Nazis did not think of it, they did not have the intelligence, the ingenuity to think of such an imaginative way to steal Greek property. Having said that, it is a disgrace, Mr Scherzo, to act as the ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany and say that we are denying and should not demand German reparations. But that is the way it has always been the way it has always been with the sycophants. They were more royal than the king. More German than the Germans. I close the parenthesis. This is Hercules.
