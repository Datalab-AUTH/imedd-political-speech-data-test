They loaded it with loans and took them abroad. They built fortunes and when the bubble burst. The entire cost of that bubble was passed on to the weaker citizens. That's what happened in 2010. For 5 years 6, this country was a model of collapse. With the exception of. A handful of oligarchs, some bankers who were bailed out by the loans of the troika and they were doing very well, but it was a handful, even the bourgeois ruling class, the richest of the Greeks, property rich, meaning you go to Kolonaki, Athens or the northern suburbs of Athens and you see people who are well-off with property, with apartments, with houses, with apartment buildings, with apartment buildings, they were suffering. Not as much as the working class, not as many women. The youth operator but they too had estates. They can't rent their apartments they can't sell them. There was no market, they paid ENVAT and had no income. In other words, for 5-6 years from 2010 onwards, all Greeks pretty much suffered together. Others much more than others in it there is no doubt about it.
