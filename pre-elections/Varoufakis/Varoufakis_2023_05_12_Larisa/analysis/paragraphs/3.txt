Why friends? To talk seriously? A country in which the official narrative is the exact opposite of reality. A country in which the difference, the gap, the chaos between what is happening and what they say is happening when it is so huge, so huge this gap this country has no future. In countries that are walking in a sustainable way there is a convergence between reality and propaganda, some relationship, some relevance. Here we have Goebbels, what did he say, we are what was his basic project as far as propaganda is concerned? To confuse the people, to reverse the truth, to reverse the truth you have to take a big lie the bigger the better and tell it over and over again. They make it a bigger lie that Greece is viable within the memorandum straitjacket, the European framework, as they call it, which has nothing to do with a European framework. Right? Because this European framework does not apply to Germany, it does not even apply to Portugal. It only applies to Greece, but it is not a European framework, it is a Memorandum framework, it is a Troika framework.
