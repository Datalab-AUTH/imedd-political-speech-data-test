Because this movement here in Greece may be small, but it has great aspirations and has the potential to empty itself, to interconnect internationalistically. With the movements. With the governments. With communities. With unions around the world. In December we launch for the fourth year in a row a global. Rolling strike against Amazon that will start the you remember, you know December will start this year in Vietnam. It will go to Bangladesh, it will go to the same, it will go to Germany from Germany it will go to the goal. It's going to go through Seattle 200 million workers are going to join the Amazon mobilization because Amazon is emblematic of the new techno-federalism of the new way of squeezing the life out of young people. It will come and here it already exists with e food with goal goals, we are looking forward, we are the left that honors the history of the left, but we are looking forward, we are not stuck in the past this some. They think it's revisionism, it's not revisionism it is. The only way to exist as the new great militant left. The faction, which we will use this election to return stronger to the parliament, but our goal after the election is to build a new great faction, to use the governmental progressive. Optimistic plan which we have to become a force to be reckoned with, a force with the goal of power, not for power, but for people, not for office. Thank you very much.
