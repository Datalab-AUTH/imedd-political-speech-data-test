Hera because it is very good that she left her parliamentary position at the time when others. From one place to another with the yes to everything to the Troika, to all those that send our children abroad, that desertify our country that make this country a debt serfdom in which not only all the predators of the earth indulge with imaginative scientifically-philosophical fury, but has become a cheap shooting range from Alexandroupolis to Souda in a war here in our region where people are being killed just to serve war criminals from Putin to Washington and Texas.
