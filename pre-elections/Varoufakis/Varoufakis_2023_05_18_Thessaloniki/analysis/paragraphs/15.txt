We will not integrate. It's not in our nature, it's not in our DNA we would rather be crushed, crushed than integrated and they know it. They know it. They see and they are horrified at the potential of our project. Example here today. The Farghani Theatre. They see that what is happening in here today at this time just before the polls on Sunday. It is only the first step in the creation of a new great faction of the new great Greek disobedient selfless disobedient left. The left that not only will never be controlled. But which submits to public debate before the many, an immediately implementable 100-day government program for the protection of the many. Initially and later in the medium and long term a transition plan to the self-managed decentralized decentralized ecological feminist socialism of the future. This my friends, fellow travellers, compañeros and compañeros is our duty, not only to disobey, but to create the critical mass that will bring about the sudden sweeping change in the expectations of the 80% of the people who, because they have accepted that there is no alternative to their plunder to the plunder of themselves are falling victim to the most brutal plunder of their lives. Of their work of our nature, of their future, of themselves and their children. For this Sunday 29 May. This is the stake that the small candle in the darkness of the meme-ridden Greece, which was relit on day 25 4 years ago, entering the Parliament, that this small candle after this and the next elections becomes a torch that will free our people from the darkness of the worst conqueror of all. Who is the first conqueror of all? It is the acceptance that in these lands there is no decent future for these young men and women here.
