VAT of 24% becomes 15, 13 becomes 6% and all basic necessities go to 0%. In addition, all advance tax payments for small and medium enterprises are abolished, and the tax rate depends on the size of the business for small enterprises up to 10 employees, 10% for medium enterprises up to 500 employees, 20% for large enterprises. We raise the rate to the perfectly reasonable 30%.
