It wasn't long ago that we had such a moment when suddenly the frustrated masses felt that yes, they have power, they felt strong. The people felt strong in unity in those heroic days. Just before the 2015 referendum. The referendum that sent panic through the oligarchy. The oligarchy that felt the ground crunching under its feet. Precisely because the human masses stopped being afraid. They felt the power of unity, the greatness of saying no to brutal blackmailers, and when the people went we are the one freed from fear to the referendum ballot boxes. These human masses became pure smiles on the faces that put aside the fear that overcame the terror and for the first time in Greek history they voted in class, they voted ignoring the parties and the system of power, right wing, centrist and left wing, without money in the bank that recognized to the troika of internal and external interests that impoverish them, so that the few live richly without producing anything. These middle-class, right-wing, right-wing, too many ignored the dictates of the new democracy and voted no.
