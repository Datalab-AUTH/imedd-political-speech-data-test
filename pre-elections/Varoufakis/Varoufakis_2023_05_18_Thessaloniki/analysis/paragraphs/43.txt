And now. A message to the others who are saying to us, you guys, back off and let Mitsotakis go and we'll find everything else. Listen to this too, so. We answer them we live and breathe for it, we live and breathe for it to be deconstructed, we deconstruct Mitsotakis S.A. But comrades, we are left-wing people. Do they think that if one man leaves, the system changes? It's not enough for one man to leave, even a group of people, to get rid of the existing machotacism this unholy alliance of extreme centrists who have never in their lives seen a cartel they didn't love and the far right who think that the security of the country requires drowning immigrants in the Aegean Sea. To really root out Mitsotakis A E, not just change their label. To get rid of its shareholders, the oligarchs who don't mind if the company changes its name. Even a CEO. They'd be happy to take another one, that's how the shareholders of the multinationals do it, they pick off one CEO after another. All they care about is the dividends. This is also true with Mitsotakis SA. Oligarchs who wouldn't mind at all if on Monday morning there was another formation, another special purpose general purpose government with a progressive facade. What does Latsis and Vardinoyannis and Peristeri and Mytilineos and Alafouzos and Marinakis care? What if it all changes? As long as the implementation of the oligarchic policies of the shareholders of what is now called Mitsotakis S.A. continues. No change within the memorandum arc.
