So let them take notice. All the mnemonics. Who have made their peace with the oligarchy without borders, the day 25 alliance for the break we exist because we firmly believe. That without a break with their iron-clad mnemonic framework that new democracy PASOK and SYRIZA dare not challenge, they see it as a one-way street. Without this break, Greece will continue to expel their children. To embitter its elders to turn day by day into a vast tourist resort paradise of dirty money laundering. Real Estate with our people excluded from the beauties of this country, paying taxes everywhere for everything, facing the horrible dilemma of either choosing immigration or a life as servants and entertainers of rich foreigners.
