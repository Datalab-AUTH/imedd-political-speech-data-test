It is undoubtedly moderate and reasonable then why do we call it a breakthrough programme? Because it is in the nature of the troika, internal and external, to break with any, any move, any threat to their own revenues. Anyone who dares to propose a moderate patriotic, pro-popular, rational, governmental programme, such as ours, even when it does not conflict with the European Treaties. In other words, we do not choose the rupture. We will legislate the obvious. The necessary to make Greece viable either in the euro or outside the euro. And our youth, you young people, to have a decent future, a decent perspective in our country. Just the memorandum arc will characterize them you hear them scream. They will characterize these self-evident rupture. And with the European Central Bank as an ally, as always vasta gerun remember. They will start making threats. This is how a break will occur. Because we don't lie. We tell you clearly, as we heard before. It takes virtue, courage and a willingness to break free. You know this shows in your faces.
