Our tongue is too thick to say to them, you guys, if we wanted ministries we would have stayed in SYRIZA, we would have been ministers for 4 years, we wouldn't have been demonized by the whole establishment. But don't you want progressive governance, they say? Here we go again. Fine, we'll start from the beginning because it seems they don't get it right the first time or the hundredth time. They want us to give them 200 times at least. What does progressive progressive mean? A government of a party that has the word progressive in its title is not enough, I think, and PASOK has proven that. Because if the word should make the party, every PASOK government should be socialist. I don't think it is nor does PASOK want socialism, it left the CN in its title as a remnant. The fact that SYRIZA put the progressive alliance underneath it by itself, I don't think that says anything. Since words are badly abused in political stigma, let me remind you what progress means to a leftist.
