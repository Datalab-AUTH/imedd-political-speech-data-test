Judging by the questions asked by the journalists of the mass deception media. The only thing we've been asked especially in this last week. Over and over again. Now that they have exhausted all their reserves of demonizing black propaganda about the hangman's noose, the banks all these sacred cows of the predators, the only thing they ask us is if we will give a vote of confidence to Mr. Tsipras to get Mitsotakis out. Is that not so? Those of you who are candidates, do you know that you will give a vote of confidence to Mr Tsipras to get Mitsotakis out? Will you join some kind of progressive coalition?
