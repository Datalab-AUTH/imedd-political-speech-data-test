It's no accident. That the fight against burning garbage. Against the encroachment of the beach of Kalamaria for the antiquities at Venizelos station for primary care, for the reopening of the infectious diseases. It is no coincidence that all these beautiful struggles are kept alive here in Thessaloniki. These soils are soaked with the sweat, tears and blood of good fighters. They demand not revenge, but vindication, fellow travellers. Their vindication requires in turn our own rupture. So, for the first time, we are here today, that is why we are here today, that is why we have created. That is why we are here. That's why we created the frontal unity ticket, the Frontal Unity Party day 25 alliance for rupture because we have a debt of disobedience and subversion to the surrender of this country. Because we have an obligation to cancel the toxic lie that there is no alternative to what darkens the minds of many. To those that force young children, either among the immigrants or inhumanely trim their dreams, your dreams. For we have an obligation to replace this toxic lie with the one sure timeless truth, everything can be different.
