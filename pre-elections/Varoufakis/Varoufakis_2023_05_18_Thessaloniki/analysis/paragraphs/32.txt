Establishment of a Social Housing Agency to build 500,000 social housing units. Which will not be given away, they will be rented at very low tenants forever until someone dies or if they want to leave. And they will be distributed to our fellow citizens on social criteria, not on criteria of who has to pay or who can borrow up to there future red loans.
