What you are saying and what we are saying is that the leadership of SYRIZA is asking us to renounce the path of subversion, it is asking us for the votes it lacks to govern so that there can be no subversion to govern by tolerating the oligarchy of the oligarchy with credentials to the oligarchy. He won't have our votes, we will blackball them. Wherever we can, wherever we meet, wherever we stand in and out of Parliament. Period.
