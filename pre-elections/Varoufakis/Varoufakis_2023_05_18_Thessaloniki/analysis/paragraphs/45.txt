Our goal in this election, as in the next, is an electoral result. We know that we will enter the Parliament strengthened. That is not the issue. We want an electoral result that is based on the coherent of our party's rich well-worked, directly implementable government programme. this electoral result will launch the emergence of the new great militant left, which will soon claim power, in order to give it to the majority of the many who are currently being plundered by the oligarchy and big capital with the help of the three memorandum parties that invoke ideologies of liberalism, one social democracy, the other left, the third ideologies which they have all long since humiliated. Nothing less will suffice. No one office matters to us, no one distracts us from this goal. No siren will distract us. We advance the new great left that we are building here tonight in Thessaloniki of the Federations in Thessaloniki, of the National Resistance, of the Polytechnic, of the NO, of the referendum of your own struggles, against the university police. This political revolution respects the past, but refuses to borrow its poetry from the past only from the future. First time rupture, everything can be different.
