For the Left, for the Left, humanity, the country, society progresses when power passes from the few to the many, from the haves to the have-nots. Which of course requires much more than a formal right to vote or some theoretical rights in a constitution, in a law. It requires a transfer of economic power from the few to the many, and certainly not in the form of subsidies. Or vote-buying, or charity. In other words, a progressive government is progressive to the extent that it breaks with the oligarchy. Period. Otherwise, if it does not break with the oligarchy, it is pro-oligarchy. What is a break? What does such a break require? Two things. These ideas are not too difficult. First, it requires a minimum common program of rupture. Which will be agreed upon by them, agreed upon by more than one party movements. A common program of rupture that in order to be worked out to sow will be put together and agreed upon at least in principle. A minimum common program was not what the left used to say? From Allende to I don't know where. It takes months, not two and a half days. Second, for a progressive government to be able to deal with the oligarchy requires a common front at the grassroots. Of the parties that will be in government. The parties that will make up such a progressive government. A government that will need this common front in the difficult moments of conflict with the oligarchy. This front needs time to be forged. It needs a lot of work. This is exactly what the Day 25 alliance proposes for the break in the leadership of the other parties that identify themselves as progressive 2 years. Now we say it, it's tongue in cheek again.
