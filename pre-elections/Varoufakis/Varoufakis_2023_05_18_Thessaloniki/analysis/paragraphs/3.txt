It is no coincidence that Mitsotakis S.A. has unleashed its greatest fury against the struggling students here in Thessaloniki. It is no accident that the abomination of the university police was defeated in practice here by your student movement, the Thessaloniki movement. It is no accident that Mitsotakis S.A. chose the malamatina as a target for the organized working class, where we have seen with our own eyes. With our own eyes we saw the heroic struggle of the trade unionists of the descendants of the Federacion who are keeping the working class of this city standing.
