I bow to you, I bow to tonight's celebration of the militant Left in this hospitable theatre because of the rain in this meteoric state, the city of struggles and sacrifices, Thessaloniki. These four years that have passed since a handful of people. We put the magnificent NO of the Greek people back in the Parliament. We put the day 25 in the Parliament. These 4 years. A handful of MPs, we sweated the jersey, the jersey of the NO by submitting a disproportionate number of technocratically sound radical law proposals, amendments, questions and interpellations.
