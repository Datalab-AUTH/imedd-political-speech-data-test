For 2 years we've been getting comments of response through the press not even on a personal level of well let's see if you get into the House and then we'll talk or now more recently they've seen that we will get in and not only will we get in, but we'll be strengthened in the House. Come and talk to you after election Sunday these are the answers. They prove one thing. They want neither a minimum common program of rupture with the oligarchy nor a common front to support a common government of rupture with the oligarchy. No wonder why this is because the Syriza leadership has long chosen not to make any break with the oligarchy. I heard Mr Tsipras say that Mr Varoufakis excluded himself from the call of the progressive forces, no Mr Tsipras the Day 25 alliance for rupture excluded himself from the distribution of ministries that you are organising, Mr Tsipras, for those who accept to co-govern at the mercy of the oligarchy in a progressive mask. That's all we needed to avoid being excluded from this dream. That is all we need to participate in it. That's all we needed to accept what you are proposing to us, Mr Tsipras, what are you proposing to us, Mr Tsipras? Think about it. You are proposing that we commit ourselves to the young generation, to the voters, to specific breakthroughs and ruptures. Yes, specific cuts and ruptures to promise you, to get your vote to make Mr Tsipras prime minister so that he does not make any of these cuts and ruptures, that is what he is telling us.
