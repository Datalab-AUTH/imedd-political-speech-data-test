I'll leave you with two messages for tonight. A message to those who call us mounds of the system. You know to whom I refer. They call us, he says, mounds of the system, because we propose immediately applicable solutions to the problems of the people. To those who accuse us that the only thing we are interested in is to civilize capitalism, to build a better capitalism. This is as accurate as the obscene lie that they signed a memorandum. Let me be clear, capitalism is not being civilized. In fact, lately capitalism has been leaning towards modern forms of digital feudalism. Rosa Luxemburg is proving more relevant than ever or if humanity has to choose between socialism and barbarism. There is no third way. But let us be serious, to avoid barbarism it is not enough to invoke the idea of socialism in the abstract. Which, unfortunately, tragically in the minds of the majority has been tarnished as a concept. What is required is that what we do is to demonstrate what could be done even today. Before socialism comes, before Second Coming. And of course what we are doing is envisioning by referring in scientific detail to a self-managed, economically participatory, rational socialism that democratizes the economic sphere, democratizes work democratizes what happens inside the company where workers work, a socialism in other words worth bleeding to sacrifice, as so many generations before us have sacrificed to build.
