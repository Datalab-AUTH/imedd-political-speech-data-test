The time. When Syriza with money and aspirations for Brussels and institutions within the domestic system, along with their right-wing centrist counterparts, voted yes. That night. We saw for a few hours in practice what Aristotle had defined as democracy as the power of the majority of the demos, who by definition are the poorest for a few hours, until Mr Tsipras overthrows the people by saying yes the no. The people had been disengaged from the bourgeois system that imposes the priorities of the very few as a one-way street as the only alternative. Then that night you remember it turned out to be rabbits and weasels in the corridors of the Syriza Maximus and my own ministry who conspired for the yes vote behind my back. Rabbits and weasels. They led the lions of the streets and squares into battle and then said they were delusional, demanded that the lions out there also get back into the iron cage of the leftist memorandum. And so upstairs the establishment was set up. The oligarchy resumed its stride, resulting in the re-establishment of the New Democracy and subsequently the establishment of the Mitsotaki A.E. Since then, having seen the devil with their own eyes, the establishment has done everything it can to demonise the referendum to murder the character of those who still honour it. They felt you see the crown fall off their heads, their power, the power they had over the many evaporate It was indeed a nightmare for them in the referendum. I understand them when they say we had a saint. Of course you didn't have a saint, Alexis you did, but that's another story.
