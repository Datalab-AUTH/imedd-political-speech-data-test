You may have to think that you are not drawing, that you cannot collect. The resentment caused by this disgusting Mitsotakis SA because you are not committed to abolishing the energy exchange, the vile Hercules, the small and medium-sized enterprises' tax prepayments, the Hyperfund, all those things that are killing the viability of the country. All those that remind us of the greatest useless capitulation of the left in the annals of history, that of the night of the referendum.
