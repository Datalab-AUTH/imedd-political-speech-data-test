We are here to reject the idea of delegation. Asking voters to vote for systemic parties that were once on the left PASOK SYRIZA instead of the reactionary delegation, we bring forward the vision of a united front of movements, organizations and parties that will wrest power. To give it back, to return it to those who have no power. They have no power over their own lives, and as a result they fall victim to the most brutal exploitation. Day 25 alliance for rupture, friends, comrades, comrades, comrades-in-arms. We are not saying to the world vote for us to save you. On day 25 alliance for rupture we are not saying to the movements of students, workers, trade unionists, ecology, join behind us, we are the vanguard. So if you line up behind us, your dreams will be realized, your struggles will be vindicated, not Day 25. Alliance for Rupture we are doing something simpler. We ask them, we ask you. What can we do for you? How can we strengthen your struggles? What education do you want? How do we promote collective agreements everywhere? What do you want us to bring to Parliament? Yes, the Day 25 alliance for the break we don't claim the vanguard. We are here to strengthen, strengthen those of you who are claiming. You are planning, you are participating, you have already broken the shackles of privatizing dreams, fears, joy and sorrow.
