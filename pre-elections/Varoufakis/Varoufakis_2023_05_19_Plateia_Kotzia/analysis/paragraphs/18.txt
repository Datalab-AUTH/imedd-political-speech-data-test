These proposals for laws are put forward by us to show the citizens out there, the citizens who have lost confidence in politics in general, not only in the Left, that there are alternatives even within this rotten, dismal half-capitalist half-feudal system. Because how else are we going to pull them off the couch by abstaining? How else do we get them out of the self-fulfilling expectation that there is no alternative? How else do we convince them? That Manos Hadjidakis' otherwise moving song is wrong when it closes with the verse with the phrase good night Kemal, this world will never change. How else can we convey to them the hope that this world is already beginning to change, that it can change radically overnight from one moment to the next, that where everything seems futile, absolutely futile, suddenly the many, the masses of people, out there who had surrendered to pessimism, cynicism, self-indulgence, suddenly realise in the blink of an eye that it can all be different.
