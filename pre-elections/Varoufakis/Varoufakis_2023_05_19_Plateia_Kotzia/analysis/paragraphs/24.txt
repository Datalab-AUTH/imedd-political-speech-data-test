Do you know well who is the greatest ally of the oligarchy? Those who talk about progressive governance. At the same time that they are renouncing the rupture. At the very moment when they renounce their past, calling it a dangerous illusion. Because words are badly abused in every election period, especially this one, let me remind you what the word progress means to us on the Left. Have we forgotten it? For the Left, humanity, the country, society progresses when power passes from the few to the many. When economic power goes from the few to the many. Not just benefits in the context of charity or vote buying, transfer of economic power from the few to the many. That's what progress means.
