That's why the rupture is needed. So. For us, rupture in practice means one thing. Without prior negotiation with anyone. We will legislate our 100-day government program. We are legislating the creation of a public red-loan management company we call Odysseus, which we will replace Hercules with. It's the only way to truly protect the basic anti-housing shop and farmland. Anyone who pretends protection without abolishing Hercules is making a mockery of our people. No bankers and no funds, folks, right? Because the bankers gave it to their own funds.
