We are here for you. For the youth. Our generation has failed. All we can do is deliver you. Whatever political capital you have left to run it. Tonight we are here in Athens and you young people must remember that this is the Athens of the uprising, of the 3rd of September, of the marginal demonstrations against the Nazi conscription. This is the Athens of Kaisariani, the Athens of the Kokkinia blockade. And not to forget. It is also the Athens of the 12 dead gassed by the British and the Bolsheviks on December 3, 1944, plunging the country into civil war and the whole world into the Cold War. We are in the Athens of 1, 1, 4 of Sotiris Petroulas, the adamant against early Mitsotakism. We are in the Athens of the funeral of the Old Man in the midst of the Junta, of the Law School uprising, of the Polytechnic. In the Athens of the squares of 2011, which like the Polytechnic in '73, the squares in '11 amidst memorials and a deep deep memorial night. The squares of '11 saved our collective moment, just as the Polytechnic saved our collective moment in the Junta, while the majority in the Parliament voted to turn the country into a vast debt serfdom. The squares were filled with a democratic pulse, laying the foundations for a break with the current extension of the memoranda, which is none other than Mitsotakis SA. We are in Athens on July 3, 2015. You remember July 3, 2015, when Syntagma Square was drowned in the flood of people of NO. That glorious evening, comrades, fellow comrades, fellow travellers, friends, that glorious evening at Syntagma. Different generations. Of the EAM of the Polytechnic, the Trade Union Struggles, the Student Struggles, different generations saw their separate struggles merging in a giant celebration of liberation, as Marianna said before fear.
