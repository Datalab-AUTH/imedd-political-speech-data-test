Finally, we are legislating the Dimitra system, the future of digital transactions that protects consumers, businesses in society from up to 2000 million euros in fees. That's the 2 billion, huh? I don't remember, it's a lot of zeros. The Demeter which at the same time will offer significant interest to depositors in the form of tax rebates. It will offer our state the possibility of cheaper internal borrowing which reduces the social cost of a banking crisis. It increases our society's defences against possible new blackmail by the European Central Bank, the flagship of the Troika. This is the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture's immediately implementable 100-day moderate program and a clarification.
Why do we call it a rupture programme? Because of realism. We have no appetite to make a break with anyone. We just want to legislate the obvious, the necessary. The necessary, so that you young people and young women can have. A decent future in your country in our country. But we are confident and we don't mince words. The Memorandum arc inside and outside Greece will mark these self-evident things as a rupture. And along with the European Central Bank ally will begin the threats of how a rupture will occur. So you see that we are not populist. We say clearly: freedom requires virtue, courage and a willingness to break. And you know this. Otherwise, you would not be here tonight, after all.
