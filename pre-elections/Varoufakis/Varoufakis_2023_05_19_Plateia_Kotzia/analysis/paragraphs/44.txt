I think I'll leave you with two messages for tonight. One message to those who call us the mound of his system, you've heard it, so. Because it says we propose immediately workable solutions to the problems of the people, but we want to operate within capitalism. To those who accuse us that we are only interested in civilizing capitalism, in building a better capitalism, I have a message for them. First of all, it is as accurate as the obscene lie that we voted for memoranda. So let me be clear, we do not mince words. Capitalism is not being civilised. Just as the circle is not squared, capitalism is not civilised. Lately, in fact, capitalism has had to say it before in modern forms of digital feudalism, proving how right, how relevant Rosa Luxemburg remains when she said that humanity. Will have to choose between socialism and barbarism. There is no third way. Socialism or barbarism?
