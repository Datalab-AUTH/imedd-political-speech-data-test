We do not play the monopoly of purity, wisdom and insight. For 2 years now, with a very heavy heart, I must confess, we have been suggesting to the same leadership, even of SYRIZA, that we sit down to discuss how they mean progressive governance a coalition government. But two years on, what do they tell us? Let's first see if you get into parliament.
And when they later and recently realised that not only will we get into Parliament, but we will get into Parliament strengthened, they turned it around to come after election Sunday. These responses mean one thing, they want neither a minimum common program of break with the oligarchy nor a common front to support a government of break with the oligarchy and the reason is simple. The SYRIZA leadership has long chosen not to make any break with any oligarchy. I heard Mr Tsipras say that Mr Varoufakis, he says, has recused himself from the call of the progressive forces, no, Mr Tsipras. The Day 25 Alliance for Rupture has disassociated itself from the distribution of ministries that you are organising, Mr Tsipras, to those who accept to co-govern at the mercy of the oligarchy, with credentials in the oligarchy and with a progressive facade. That is all we need, Mr Tsipras, to accept what we are being asked to commit ourselves to our voters, to these young people. Imagine now if it is possible to commit ourselves to these young people, so that we will make cuts and breaks to get their vote, so that we can get their vote and then make Mr Tsipras Prime Minister, so that the cuts and breaks that we committed ourselves to never happen. If we did that, we would have no reason to exist, not only politically. Biological. We would nullify our raison d'Ãªtre, which is none other than the return of the leftist ethic of telling the truth because the truth is liberating, not hiding it to extract some office.
