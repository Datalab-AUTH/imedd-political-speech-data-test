Today, tonight, here in Greece. That candle becomes a candle, because we worked hard, because we never asked for a commission. And you know what else? You know. Because we didn't want to be alone within the walls of our so-called higher political morality. The candle that we turned into a candle and today becomes a candle is because we opened the doors, the arms, the souls of Day 25 to non-members of the left, to movements of new feminism, new trade unionism, radical ecology in youth organizations like ARAS, like children from other organizations who joined together with Day 25 youth. Of course. Of course, I see you here now, the new line, the comrades of Popular Unity, a convergence. A convergence that makes me feel that it is worth living this moment with you.
