Let's go to today. Today, the self-proclaimed owners of Greece, so they consider themselves, Alafoussians at the same time, understand the danger that the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture poses to their power. They know that unlike SYRIZA, which they have long since integrated, we are not going to be integrated. It is not in our nature, it is not in our DNA. They see and are horrified at the potential of our project, in you, in your faces. They understand that what we are doing here is only the first step in the creation of the new great Greek disobedient, selfless, disobedient Left that we lived with our comrades in France, in Britain, in Ireland, in Bulgaria, in Albania. By the way, yesterday our sister party in Albania, which has just been created, got 4.78% in the municipal elections in Tirana.
