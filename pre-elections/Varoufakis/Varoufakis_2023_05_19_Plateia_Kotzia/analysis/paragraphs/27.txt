In conclusion, the leadership of the so-called progressive parties is asking us for the votes they lack in order to rule for the wolf. We will not have them. Period. And to end with the leadership of Syriza who are in a panic mode, it's clear. They wonder why Mr. Tsipras and the whole bunch are not pulling SYRIZA. We suggest that they should think that maybe it is because of the image, we saw it on the screen, of Mr Latsis publicly thanking them for giving him the Greek land for development. Why can't they get it through their heads that this is one reason why you guys are not pulling out? Could it be the other picture? Mr. Pyatt, who was the United States ambassador here in Athens, thanking Mr. Tsipras for pointing out Alexandroupolis as the new military base of the United States from which they are adding fuel to the fire on the fields of the endless inhuman battles in Ukraine.
