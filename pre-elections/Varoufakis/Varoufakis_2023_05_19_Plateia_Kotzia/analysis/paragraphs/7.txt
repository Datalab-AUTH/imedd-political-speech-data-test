Because fellow travellers, comrades, friends, don't make the mistake of thinking that what we are experiencing here tonight is just an election rally. We are not here just to celebrate our certain consolidation in Parliament, absolutely certain, but that is not why we are here, no. We're here for something bigger, more beautiful. We are here to celebrate the emergence of the new great militant left that will leave everyone with their mouths hanging open. After this Sunday's election. And especially after the July runoff election.
