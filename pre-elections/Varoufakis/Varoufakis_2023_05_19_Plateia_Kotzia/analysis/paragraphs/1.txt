Comrades, friends, romantic disobedient, disobedient realists, fellow travellers and competitors. Along with Jeremy Corbyn's companion greeting, along with Adrienne Cluément, who was here on the podium conveying the moving support for the Day 25 Alliance for the Rupture of France's Insubordinate France party, co-host Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Along with the support I carry, at the request of the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador and his Morena party. Along with the love and wishes of another old friend of many of you and me, Rafael Correa, Naomi Klein, our heartfelt companion and friend Noam Chomsky, Elche Temelcuran, Brian Ino who has written the musical theme to each of our videos, Roger Water. And all of our fellow travelers of Day 25 Europe-wide, the Progressive International, which counts 200 million members from all over the planet. Along with all these messages, tonight it is my duty to carry here in our Athens, to you who have set up tonight's celebration of struggle, rupture and subversion. To bring you the message of the struggle for good from all corners of our Greece. From wherever we have passed on this electoral journey. From Rhodes and Xanthi to Alexandroupolis. From Chania and Heraklion to Serres and Kavala. From Volos, Trikala, Larissa to the Ionian Kyra, Corfu. From Ioannina and Arta to Patras, Aegio, Corinth, yes, and Sparta, Kalamata. The message. From all these places. From places with soil soaked with sweat, with the tears and blood of fighters who never wilted. Even under the yoke of the most brutal occupation. Even after the bitterest defeats.
The message from everywhere. The message we have been authorized to bring you tonight is one. Enough mourning for the betrayed referendum, time for a new overthrow.
