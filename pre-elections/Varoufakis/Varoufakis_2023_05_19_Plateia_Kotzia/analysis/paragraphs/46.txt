That was one message. Now I have another message to the others who are telling us and will be telling you from today until Sunday morning and perhaps in the evening and beyond. Come on you guys, put your backs into getting Mitsotakis out and then we'll make up, we'll answer them live and breathe, to dismantle Mitsotakis SA. But we are left-wing people, you guys, is it enough for a man to leave for socialism to come, for exploitation to stop, for plunder to stop? In what country in the world has something wonderful like this happened, to get rid of one man and everything will be done as it should be? We want to get rid of not only Mitsotakis. But with the existing machotacism, this unholy alliance. Be careful, machotacism is not just right-wing. It is something worse. It's an unholy alliance of far-right centrists who have never been a cartel to love. And far-rightists who believe that the security of the country requires drowning migrants in the Aegean. That's what existent machoctacism is.
