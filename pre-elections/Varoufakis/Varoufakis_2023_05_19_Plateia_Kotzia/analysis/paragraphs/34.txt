We abolish the golden visa immediately. No more golden visa. You won't get a Schengen visa because you bought some apartments and put them on AirBnB. We are drastically restricting, at the same time, AirBnB, all these short-term rental platforms that push rents sky high that make it impossible for our people students, doctors, nurses, teachers, professors to find a place to rent. Yes, you will be able to rent your house through AirBnB or similar platforms, but for a maximum of 60 days a year and not consecutive days. Two separate months, May and September to make some pocket money. But you won't be able to de-facto withdraw our country's apartments and ship them overseas, because that's what AirBnB is.
