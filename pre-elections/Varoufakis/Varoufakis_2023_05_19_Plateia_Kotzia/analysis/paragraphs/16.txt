Two words because we reject the idea of delegation, the delegation that asks their voters to be clear to parties that were once associated with the Left, PASOK and SYRIZA. Instead of the reactionary delegation, we bring forth the vision of a united front of movements, of party organizations that will wrest power to give it back to those who have no power. On their own lives. And having no power, the result is that they fall victim to ever more brutal exploitation. The Day 25 Alliance for Rupture is not telling people to vote for us to save you. We are not saying to the world I am not to the students in the youth movements, the workers in the ecology movements line up behind us so that we can realize your dreams on your behalf, so that your struggles can be justified. No. The Day 25 Alliance for Rupture asks you. What can we do for you? How can we empower you without hating your struggles? What education do you want? How do we promote collective bargaining in the sectors you work in? What do you want us to bring to the parliament where we only enter to be your voice.
