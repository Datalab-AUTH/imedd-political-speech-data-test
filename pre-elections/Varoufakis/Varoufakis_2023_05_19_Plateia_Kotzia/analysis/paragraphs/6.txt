We are not only in this Athens. In the city station, in a history full of struggles and betrayals of the people. But also in a square whose two names symbolize the permanent struggle in the heart of our city, between hope and despair, between light and darkness. Kotsias Square is the square most of us know, a surname that refers to the mayor and later minister of the fascist dictatorship of the Wednesday of August. National Resistance Square is written on the kiosks today. A national resistance against everything that the pro-Muslim Anti-Communist Kotzias stood for. A square, a city, a long tradition of difficult but necessary and necessary struggles. To this tradition of struggles in this city of Athens, you too, especially the youth of today, come to add your own little stone. Let us all celebrate a renaissance together.
