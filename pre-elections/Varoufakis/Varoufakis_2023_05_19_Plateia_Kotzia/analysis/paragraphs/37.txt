Therefore, we are planning the country's productive restructuring and green industrial revolution on the following basis, focusing on the domestic production of green technologies in areas affected by deindustrialization. Example in the industrial region of Patras, high-tech battery manufacturing factories. In Megalopolis, Volos and Ptolemaida, the manufacture of marine aluminium wind turbines. While we allow and plan, in the arc of Northern Greece, Macedonia and Thrace, from Thessaloniki to Alexandroupolis, to become a centre for the production and distribution of green hydrogen, which is the diesel of the future.
