And this new one. What is being born is none other than the disobedient disobedient disobedient big left that is now emerging little by little but rapidly, especially among the youth who embrace the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture and are inspired by our well-crafted technocratically sound and politically subversive government program. A program. A program that we have been building patiently, carefully, scientifically before Day 25 was even founded, from the heroic rings of Diem 25, shortly after the referendum. I look around me and recognize the old ranks of Day 25, you who were with us, in Santarosa Square. Do you remember? July 2019. We were fewer and fewer then. We were anxious to put our people's magnificent NO back in Parliament. We were united by our refusal to sit on the couch and curse the darkness. And so with our swallow in front of us on that Sunday, July 7, 2019, we managed to light a candle. We managed to put the no vote in Parliament for the first time since the summer of 2015. For the first time, we broke the darkness with rays of light subtle but irresistible.
