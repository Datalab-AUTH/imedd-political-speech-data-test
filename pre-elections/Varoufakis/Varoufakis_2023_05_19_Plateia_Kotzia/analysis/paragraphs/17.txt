Yes, friends. Fellow travellers, comrades, we do not claim the vanguard. We are here to strengthen those of you who are claiming, planning, participating, you have already broken the shackles of the privatization of dreams, fears, joy and sorrow. Yes, we are tabling proposed laws for everything.
But this, parliamentary work is not based on the illusion that our proposals will be implemented because they are good ideas that they will be implemented by the system, they will say that the system what good ideas they will implement. No. These legislative proposals. Like Odysseus on red loans, the Demetra system that will break the banking monopoly on digital transactions, the recovery of democratic sovereignty over tax offices, public property, energy.
