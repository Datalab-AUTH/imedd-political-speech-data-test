Friends, friends, we are the only party that says no mining anywhere and we abolish every mining contract. Why? Because dependence on new sources of fossil fuels. It shields the oligarchs. It rewards the lenders. It poisons the soil, the water, the seas, the beauty of this country, of the entire Mediterranean, turning our space, our nature into a sad cross structure of black oil tanker pipelines. The oligarchs do not care. They will have the wealth to buy villas in places still clean. They will filter their water and build fences to keep the victims of poverty, climate and environmental destruction at bay. To put it simply, mining is deeply classist. It is a raid on the environment. And climate disaster is also a form of insidious international class warfare.
