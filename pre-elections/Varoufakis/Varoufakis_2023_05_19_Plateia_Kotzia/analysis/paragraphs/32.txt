We are implementing the plan to relieve small and medium-sized enterprises from the tax burden of the Troika. Specifically, with regard to VAT, the 24% rate goes to 15%, 13% to 6% and all basic living expenses to 0%. At the same time as we are abolishing all tax prepayments for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time that the tax rate for small businesses, 1-10 employees, goes to 10%. 11-500 employees, medium sized businesses, goes to 20%. And, over 500, what is it? Supermarkets, OPAP, banks, and the evil cabal. It goes to 30%, that makes sense.
