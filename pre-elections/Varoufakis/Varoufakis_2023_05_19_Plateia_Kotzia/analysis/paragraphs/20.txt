Until Mr Tsipras overthrows the people by saying yes to their no. Just before those hours of freedom we felt that night before the capitulation, the people had been unleashed from the bourgeois system that imposes the priorities of the very few as the only alternative. Since then, having seen the devil with its own eyes, the establishment has done everything to demonise the referendum. To assassinate the character of those of us who still honour it. They have felt the issue tilting and falling off their heads. To lose the power they had over the many to have that power evaporate. It was a nightmare for them. When they say they had a saint then, in July 2015, I get it. Of course they did not have a holy saint. Alexis they had. But that's another story.
