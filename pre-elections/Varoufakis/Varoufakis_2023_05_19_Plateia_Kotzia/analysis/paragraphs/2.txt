Subversion. History is being disobediently written. It is written with disobedience. So much for lamentation, time for a new reversal. So much for decay, time for a first rupture. So much for the toxic lie that there is no alternative, that rupture is an illusion. Time for it to be owned that, yes, everything can be different. Last night we were in Thessaloniki, the Thessaloniki of the Federacion, of the 12 dead workers who fell on May Day 1936. The Holocaust of our Jewish fellow citizens, the blockade of Chortiatis, the dead youth of the EDA, the place where Lambrakis was murdered in '63 or Yannis Chalkidis under the Junta, but also the city where, under Mitsotakis SA, the students of the Aristotle University took on the abomination of the university police of Mrs Kerameos and won. They annulled it in practice.
