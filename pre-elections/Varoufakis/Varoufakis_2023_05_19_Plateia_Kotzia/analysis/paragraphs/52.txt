Let me add the following. The intra-memorandum rotation, one leaving the other without changing the memorandum framework, as they say they will not change it, is a guarantee of the perpetuation of Mitsotakism under another name in the post-Mitsotakis era. My friends, fellow comrades the things are simple. As I said before, our goal in these elections, as in the next ones, is an electoral result that, on the basis of our coherent well-worked and directly implementable governmental program, will launch the emergence of the new great militant left of the youth, which will soon, in the name of the youth, claim power in order to give it to the majority, to the many, to those who are plundered by the oligarchy and big capital. Plundered with the help of the three memorandum parties that invoke ideologies, liberalism one, democracy the other, Left Marxism the third. Ideologies which they have long ago trivialised. Nothing less will suffice. No axiom distracts us from this goal. No siren will distract us. We move forward. The peaceful revolt against the extinguishing of the light that began tentatively four years ago with the entry of Day 25 into Parliament, two days after that rally in Santarosa Square. Today, with Mera 25 Alliance for Rixi, here in the square opposite the Athens City Hall, it is in full growth and tomorrow the new great Left that the country needs will be born.
