Just as they had done before, so now with the news that Alafouzos, Marinakis, Vardinoyannis and the evil cabal are trafficking Putin's oil. A truth that when Kleonas told it from the floor of parliament he was sued by Alafouzos. And what's the best part? Which is the most imaginative? It's this, Alafoozos sues Cleonas for carrying Putin's oil and Alafoozos' channel, SKI, doesn't mention it. Such news of megaton proportions. You have the head of SKAI suing a parliamentary representative of a parliamentary party and I don't mention it, it's not news for this channel or for the other channels of other friends and enemies of Mr. Marinakis.
