When the memorandum arc. They will get over the transitions between their intra-family disputes and form another memorandum government, which of course will bring the new measures imposed by the Troika. That's how it is. They know it. What do you think Mr Katrougalos' crime was? He blurted out what all the Memorandumists know but which they keep a secret during the election campaign. What is the secret? That either with New Democracy or with Syriza, or with a combination of New Democracy, PASOK and Syriza, measures are coming. It could not be otherwise, the state, the social security funds and the private sector are sinking deeper and deeper into the black hole of bankruptcy that began in 2009-2010. This is the fate of any government that honours and accepts the memorandum framework.
