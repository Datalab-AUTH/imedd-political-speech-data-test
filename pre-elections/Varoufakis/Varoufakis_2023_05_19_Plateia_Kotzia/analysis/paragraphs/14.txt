I spoke before about the convergence with Popular Unity and with the other fellow travellers or comrades from all the movements who are with us tonight. It points the way to an even greater and even more effective unity of the Left. It demonstrates what the unity of the Left requires in practice. It requires on the one hand that you have not sold out for a chair, that you have not become compromised. And on the other hand, it demands that you overcome bitterness and selfishness by focusing away from yourself. This is the cornerstone of the Day 25 Alliance for Rupture and believe me. It is a solid foundation, a foundation capable of lifting up the new great left we are all building together. With this election? Yes, it is but a beautiful stop on a beautiful journey. An electoral result on Sunday night that will strengthen our momentum before that momentum is ejected by spreading hope again to our comrades trapped in memorandum parties.
