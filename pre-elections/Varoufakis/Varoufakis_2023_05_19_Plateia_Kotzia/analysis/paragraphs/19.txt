Do you know why they hate the NO vote in the referendum? Because it was at such a moment that the frustrated masses suddenly felt that yes, they have power, they felt strong, they felt strong, strong in unity, it was those heroic days, just before the referendum. The referendum that sent panic through the oligarchy, the oligarchy that felt the ground crunching under its feet, precisely because the human masses stopped being afraid, they felt the power of unity, the greatness of saying no to brutal blackmailers. And when these liberated people went to the referendum ballot boxes and cast their no vote, these human masses suddenly transformed into pure smiling faces. Faces that put aside fear that overcame terror and for the first time in Greek history voted along class lines. They voted ignoring the parties and the system of power. That night we saw, if only for a few hours, we saw in practice what Aristotle defined as the Athenian Republic. Which is what? The power of the majority of the demos, who by definition are the poorest. For a few hours. For a few hours the poor declared their interest.
