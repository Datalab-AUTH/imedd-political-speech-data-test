But you see, our people are not used to parties that are not afraid to talk to them so openly 2 days before your elections and talk to them about the cost of tears, blood, sweat, all the things that freedom requires. But that's the way we at Day 25 for the Alliance for the Rising are saying what we believe and believing what we say. Before Election Sunday. And after election Sunday. Both the first election and the second and the third and the fourth.
