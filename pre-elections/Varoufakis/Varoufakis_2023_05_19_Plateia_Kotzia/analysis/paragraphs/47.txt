By the way, did you notice, did your antennae, your antennae catch the York Times article today along with the video? Proving once again the crimes against refugees by Mitsotakis SA, always with the cover-up of the European Union. Did you see in this video the horrific images, April 11th, now recently? 12 of our fellow human beings, some of them children, young children 3, 4, 5 years old, being taken in a Coast Guard van to a deserted beach, a beach on Lesvos. Before being forcibly taken to a boat, which then took them to a Coast Guard vessel, which then abandoned them in the middle of the Aegean Sea, in flagrant violation of international law, the international law that all governments invoke against Turkey. We did not make this up. The conservative New York Times made it up.
