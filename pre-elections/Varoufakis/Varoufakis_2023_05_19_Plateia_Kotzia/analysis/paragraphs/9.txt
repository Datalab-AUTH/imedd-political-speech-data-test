We neither honour it nor accept it. This is what we do. We move forward for a disobedient, disobedient, selfless Left. We don't honor the memorandum framework we don't accept it so it's nice tonight because it's a beautiful thing to participate in a historic moment. Why historic? Because here today, friends, comrades, compa√±eros, fellow travellers, at last, the new that for so many years refused to be born after the death of the old is finally beginning to be born.
