Exactly. No bosses. No bosses and no bureaucrats. To put it another way, a progressive government must come by definition to be progressive in its break with the oligarchy, otherwise it is by definition pro-oligarchy. Which means a progressive in government needs two things. First, a minimum common program of rupture that, to be worked out, must be forged together. It takes months many cannot be done Monday to Wednesday. Second, a progressive coalition government needs something else. What we are building here. A common front on the basis of the parties, the parties that will constitute the progressive, supposedly in government a front that will support them in the difficult moments of the conflict with the oligarchy, a front that takes time and work to build, a front like the one we are building here today in National Resistance Square, and not Kotzias.
