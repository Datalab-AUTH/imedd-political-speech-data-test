I want to leave you. With a phrase that caught my ear. In 2011. In Syntagma Square, just before the dispersal of the indignados with that chemical warfare of the police. I remember a young protester, I never got her name, saying to a PASOK MP, who was pushing the protesters to get into the parliament, gasping to vote for memoranda, throwing her a who are you, baby, to stop me from voting for this? Then the young protester calmly sober, almost serene, tells him who should I be? Drawing strength from the sober strength of the sober fighter, having all together overcome the lamentation of the defeat of 2015, looking ahead to the new upheaval we are launching, as I said last night in Thessaloniki, our political revolution, comrades, comrades, comrades-in-arms, friends, our political revolution today refuses to borrow its poetry from the past, only from the future. And so we find the strength to shout first break, everything can be otherwise we move forward.
