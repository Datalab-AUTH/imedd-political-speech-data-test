So you saw who we really want to uproot Mitsotakis SA. us. It is not enough for us, of course, for Kyriakos and his company to leave Maximou so that we can say in these sad rooms as some people desire. We demand not only that Mitsotakis leave, but that we get rid of the shareholders of the eponymous.
The oligarchs. Who you know now care, they don't mind changing the name of the SA, call it something else. They'd be happy to accept another CEO, let Mitsotakis go and someone else come in. The only thing they would care about would be a real progressive government that doesn't continue to implement the oligarchic policies that line their pockets. Which pockets are theirs now? Their pockets don't fit, Cayman Islanders don't fit, digital money doesn't fit in there either. So to get rid of not only Mitsotakis, but also existing Mitsotacism, requires a break with the Memorandum arc, not a change within the Memorandum arc. It is the debt of disobedience. The only debt we have. It is the debt of disobedience. The only debt we have is the debt of disobedience. We do not obey the orders of the oligarchy.
