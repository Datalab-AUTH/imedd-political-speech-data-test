Before the July 2019 elections, they thought that nightmare was irrevocably over. Until July. Until July 2009, when Day 25 revived the no vote by putting it back in the House. And what didn't they say? Diaton star is gone, gone, gone, never to be in the House. Isn't that what they said? What they didn't do to keep us from getting back into the House to extinguish that candle of hope that lit the day 25 in the House. They foresaw our disappearance, they worked diligently to cause imperatives in our parliamentary team, which in the end did us enormous good because we got rid of uncivilized people who had come with us for the offices, not the people.
