Third. The Superfund. Do you realize that we are a country under occupation? Can you tell me another country in the world where in human history, apart from periods of actual occupation, there is a Super Fund in which all the public property, that is, what is left of it, has been put into it, and it is controlled by foreigners. Tell me a country in which this was not even done in India under the British Empire, and SYRIZA passed this. Under SYRIZA, the Hyperfund was passed, hands off the Hyperfund. Whatever bits don't bother them these 3 sacred geese with golden eggs are considered that they can participate in a coalition government, either with liberal.
Either neoliberal or progressive. That is why we in the day 25 alliance for rupture will not participate in any coalition, because we will slaughter all 3 of these sacred geese one by one.
