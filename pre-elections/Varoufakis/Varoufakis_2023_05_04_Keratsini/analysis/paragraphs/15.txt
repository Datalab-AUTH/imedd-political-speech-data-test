You remember a while ago when the government legislated those platforms of Mr. Pierrakakis. The market pass the fuell pass the allowances that humiliatingly gives to the Greeks who are suffering from the new austerity which is of course The Accuracy. The precision that is created to a very large extent by the supermarkets, the energy exchange, all those who find an opportunity with the increase in energy costs, the increase in transport costs to send prices sky-high, they have made it anyway. Imagine, I can't imagine. Because we're a serious party. It would never occur to me to criticize the government. Then we criticized what I'm criticizing you now for being a subsidy to the supermarket man oligarchs. It never occurred to me, maybe it should have occurred to me, I'm not a good politician, it seems, to stand up in Parliament and say Mr Mitsotakis. With how many Pierakakis are we going to buy a litre, petrol or a packet of macaroni? My mind doesn't go that far to think about that.
