But progressive government means going against them. You have to write your own program. So you need preparation and you need the people out there to be ready to support your government in going up against the media of mass deception with the bankers, with the financiers, with all the people who will do anything to bring you down if you mess with their bosses. This progressive Front movement, when are we going to build it, between Monday morning and Wednesday afternoon? So when they say come after Sunday, what do they say? We don't want a clash with the oligarchy, we want to do everything we've promised the oligarchy or not do any of the things we've promised them we'll do the three sacred geese I was referring to before, not to be touched And you're going to come and get a ministry You guys, you know if I wanted a ministry wouldn't it have been lost that night? We didn't build the day 25 alliance to break up to get a ministerial car we don't love ministerial cars. We're about people, we're not about office.
