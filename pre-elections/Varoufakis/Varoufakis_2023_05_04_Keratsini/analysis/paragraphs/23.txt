So that's why we are so determined as far as AirBnb is concerned, I have no objection if any of you want to rent your home. For a period of time. Do it. For a period of time you go, say. For example in Thessaloniki for a month to work. And you take the goal for a month. Well, no problem, let's say you can rent it for 60 days, not all at once. You can rent it in May and August, May and June. And under no circumstances of course corporate AirBnb like the ones we are referring to.
