And in final analysis combination the Ulysses, Social Housing Agency, Ban, abolition of the Golden Visa. And immediate restriction of AirBnb. By what right do they give Schengen Visa to a Ukrainian Russian Nigerian Chinese no matter he comes to live in Europe on the basis that he has got a condominium here in Piraeus, nor a condominium with 250 grand he gets which AirBnb does. He doesn't even come to stay in Greece, he goes to Berlin, you go to Paris, Schengen visa. Comes tourists stays in AirBnb the money go American tourists example from the American tourist's American account go to the owner's German account. They don't even cross the country from here we only have the tourist, I'm not saying to come the man, the tourist. But here nothing stays nothing. Absolute zero is radical, number zero. I insist. It stays minus because what is actually happening? It's like a brain drain Here we have a building drain, it's like we've sent our apartment buildings abroad, because they're not rented to Greeks anymore. So the supply of houses is decreasing when your supply is decreasing, because the rents of the others are increasing. We are talking about a dark vortex. With this history, so we say abolition of Golden Visa and extremely.
