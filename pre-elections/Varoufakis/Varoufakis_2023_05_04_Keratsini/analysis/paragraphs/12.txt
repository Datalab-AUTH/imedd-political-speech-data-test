They say, he says, Staikouras says the Delphi Forum, which is the Davos of Greece. The dailies, the shipping, the capitals. Mr. Kyriakos Mitsotakis that foreign investors triumph for Greece of course what can I get out when they come and take such profit rates, plundering the Greek people? Why are they not worshipping the Mitsotakis government and not upgrading all the old paper we sell them? Because by buying all these property titles they are earning profit rates that do not exist in existing capitalism, they only exist in Greece. Do you see the amazing contradiction? On the one hand, our debt, our bankruptcy, the misery of this country, the misery of this country, the more and more it deepens, and the more it deepens, the more the rating of the Greek security increases, either for red loans or for Greek bonds. The country's credit rating. When we went bankrupt do you remember 2010? It's been 13 years.When we went bankrupt we had an income of 220 something let the zeros be many 220 something we had a debt of 300 220 something income 300 debt now we have 192 income. 400 debt. We are more bankrupt than ever. And yet.  The foreign investors and their local minions are triumphant because our bankruptcy is their overreach.
