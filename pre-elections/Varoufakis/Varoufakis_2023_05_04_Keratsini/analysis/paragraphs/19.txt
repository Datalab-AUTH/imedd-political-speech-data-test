A short pause here in brackets. Bring payroll. Mitsotakis that we have an immediate influx of investment because the fund brought 3 grand into the country? Amazing he says jobs to witness jobs with these direct, no jobs came in and got the loan with 3K he puts it on the hammer 50. The guy who had paid off the 100K gets nothing, he gets thrown out on the street, whether it's a homestead or a small business. And this fund has put 3 down and gotten 47 and taken it to the Cayman Islands. The place won't see it, he's not even like the evil Greek zapper in the Greek black and white movies who was kind of fat who took people's money, but then spent some in the neighborhood. Oh boy, he's going to the Cayman Islands. 70 billion will be transferred that way. There's only one way to stop this. Not with what Syriza says either. SYRIZA, with the proposals it has made, knows what it is doing. It basically secures them. That they will get the 50 of these tells you I'll do a haircut, they won't get the 100, they'll get the ear. They were never going to get the 100 they gave 3K to buy the 100K loan to get 50. The only way is to eliminate the Hercules purchase. Driving these predatory funds out of the country, creating a public company to manage the bad loans, giving this person the right to stay in the house, paying a fee of no more than 1/6th of disposable income, to freeze forever, to keep the percentage of the house that he has already paid off, so that when the loan is paid off at some point, whether it is sold or whatever, he can keep the portion of this borrower's share that he has put from his or her savings over the years for this house. This is the Ulysses program. It is well designed technocratically. But it is also a nightmare of the funds waiting to get 70 billion will go to the Greek kaymans, what can we do? We can't, we either choose our people or the rights of the predators. It is not a difficult choice. It's not a hard choice. I hope you agree.
