First we will abolish the energy exchange, which energy exchange is not an energy exchange. Anyone who knows doesn't need to know much, if you've heard of an exchange, you know that in an exchange it's a market that needs thousands of players to operate. To compete with each other so that prices are kept at levels that are somewhat in line with the values of the companies whose shares are traded on the exchange. It must be thousands when it's 5, you know what it's called? Coffee shop. Yeah, he knew. Coffee shop sits the nor 10, nor do they send the pink hot ones themselves. Latsis, Mytilineos, Pigeon, Vardinoyannis and the conglomerate and not even send now is with we live like this, it's all electronic and they decide every day what price to put us. That's it. By what rules? Do you know? No one, no one, no one, it says stock market is self-regulating, yes if you have thousands of players, if you have 5, the only self-regulation is how much to put on the megawatt hour today. Like a cow, if you don't hit it too hard. She might die, you might not have milk tomorrow. That's their limitation. How much they can extract from the Greek society the maximum and you know I did Mytilineos came out today. Read navy trade and he said he said 112% increase in his profits from last year which was 103% increase over the year before and calculate what that is? Every year 100% earnings growth and up. But that's how great a businessman he is to tip his hat to. Jeff Bezos doesn't have that kind of earnings growth, he wouldn't be that good a businessman, they're not entrepreneurs. They're predators. Because if he's given them the right to choose what prices they charge you we go to another one which is one of my favorite topics.
