That's where 13 years of debt serfdom has gotten us. Because I am in this place which is a sacred place for us because of its history. Let us not forget that in this area from here to Elefsina, where we were before, we had a mini industrial revolution from the 1930s onwards, I would say, especially in the 1950s with the Marshall Plan, which means that at the same time, there was a brutal exploitation of the working class, of the women who worked in the factories, but also in the shops and in the homes. We have had a history of refugees coming here to these lands being labelled as Turks, a racism against refugees that has been going on ever since. We have a history of very beautiful struggles from which beautiful things have come out. A trade unionism that was pure then, A Cultural development, A pride of the working people who made their lives through adversity, despite living with the sledge-hammer of exploitation, With very low incomes, but with a sense that the future was worth fighting for. A region that the debt prison, the debt prison, brought to the pre-Godfathers of Marazosis. From what was the cradle of this country's remaining industrial revolution compared to industrial revolutions in other countries, but a significant industrial revolution from the cradle of our own industrial revolution, this place became a melting pot of pollutants, a melting pot that, as the mayor here has taught us, that the ruling class wanted to sort out, slowly began to accumulate in this area. Example the beeswaxer down at the beach.
