So you will allow me one complaint. When Mr. E talks about the Merra 25 coalition for the break and says that we support it, we do something with it, we do something with the fascists anyway. Comrades of the KKE together we voted against the amendment as a political leader. President of the parliamentary group of day 25, I stood up on the plenary session of the parliament and said several reasons why we voted against it, as the KKE voted against the amendment, one of the main reasons is that today they are using such an amendment to ban Kasidiaris' party. Tomorrow they will ban the communists. Because we live in an unhistorical European Union, were my exact words, where every 23/08 these unhistorical European Union sack the communists with the Nazis, forgetting that if it were not for the communists, the Nazis would have won from the Atlantic to the Urals. That's what I said. So friends of the KKE. I don't know what the polls are showing you and you're alarmed at us. We tell you one thing. We will be in the same cells if the Nazis win or if Kyriakos Mitsotakis and company continue to win. And that is why we only turn the other cheek and consider you comrades.
