Fellow travellers, friends, friends, compañeras, compañeros, compañeros, these cannot be changed by blah blah blah. That doesn't change by playing a little with a tax rate from here to there. A solidarity contribution here and there with a contribution to social security funds further on. These things can only be changed by a frontal rupture, which only the day 25 alliance for rupture stands for and has a plan to do.
