Speaking of the roof. There is more nonsense than what both the New Democracy and Syriza are saying about the problem of young people who can't find houses to rent or buy a house because they don't have enough money either to pay the rent or to pay a mortgage. The problem says they don't have enough money, we need to subsidize them and they suggest. You hear on the New Republic and Syriza axis a rent subsidy. I mean, how much brains does it take to figure out that if you subsidize the rent, the rent will go up? And then the Greek government will have borrowed more money with no benefit to young couples or older to older couples. The only way to reduce rents is to increase the supply of homes. So the social housing agency. Build eco-friendly neighborhood complexes with sophisticated green technologies to also help domestic production of green technologies in the building industry.
