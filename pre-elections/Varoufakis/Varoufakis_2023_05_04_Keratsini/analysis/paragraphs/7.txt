Friends. These are important days as we speak, the decision makers are planning the next coalition government, which government I don't know which parties will work with. But I do know that the decision-making centres are interested in one thing. A coalition government that firstly, will avoid slaughtering the 3 sacred geese that lay the golden eggs of the oligarchy. They don't want these sacred geese to be touched. The energy exchange. One. Keep your hands off the energy exchange, they say, there's a lot of money in it. For the five. Vardinoyannis, Latsis Melissani, not Beesanides, Mytiline, Pigeon and the English CDC that has taken our PPC.
