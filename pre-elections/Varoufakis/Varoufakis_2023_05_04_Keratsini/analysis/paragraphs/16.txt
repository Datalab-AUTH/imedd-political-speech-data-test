So, just to be clear. The Dimitra system is the future of digital transactions. They like it, they don't like it and we don't implement it. It will be implemented. It's the future in countries where central banks, unlike us in Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, China, China, the United States have this digital public trading system, which will go beyond the banking system. And you won't have to pay a toll to buy a coffee from a shop; to make a transfer from one account to another account, this will be built on top of the digital system of central banks for countries that have central banks. The innovation of demitra is that for a long time because I have been working on it and we are working on it with our partners and in Ecuador with Rafael Correa, then because they also have such an issue. They don't have their own central bank because just like we have the euro, they have the dollar. The demitra is such a digital system, which is being set up, founded, built on because we do not have a central bank on Taxis Net on the Taxis Net on the TIN. Each TIN has an account. You transfer Now you don't transfer money from the account to your fame to pay ENFIA traffic fees a bunch of fees nice. With equivalent codes and much easier with mobile apps with plastic cards that we will issue, you will be able to transfer money from one TIN to another TIN to make payments without paying any fees to anyone you will be able to park and its from your savings and get a great equivalent interest rate. Which you will get in the form of time discounts to give you an example instead of having 1000 € in Piraeus on the highway you leave it in the account of the executioner in Euro Mr. Mitsotakis, so that you are not confused, I tell you. And keep a year in a year those 1000 € pay off example 1080 € taxes, you get 80 the equivalent of 80 € interest equivalent of 8% interest. Which bank gives you 8% interest? None, it gets you 8%. Easy, and 10 and 18 and 22 vpn so but if you have 1000 € in if I'm not mistaken it gives 0.6% at the moment then.
