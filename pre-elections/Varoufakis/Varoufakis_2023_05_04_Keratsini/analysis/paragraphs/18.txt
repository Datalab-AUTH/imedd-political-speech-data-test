This is just a small piece of our programme. Our Ulysses Red Loan program is even more important and one reason they talk about the executioner is so they don't talk about Ulysses. You know the story of the red loans, but it is worth telling it once more in passing so that we can absorb it. You have a man who got a house 150 grand, in the good times 150 grand. He had the 50; he gave it away and borrowed 100. Out of the 100 he paid off 50, total that is until the crisis started or she herself could no longer repay out of the 150 she had given for the house she had paid off the 100 and she has 50 left. But life is not going well, what can we do? Collapsed the collapse of the Greek economy can not repay. Reduce the loan panotokia the 50 left to owe become 100. A fund based in Delaware or Jersey comes in; it buys this loan that has gone from 50 100 to 3000.
