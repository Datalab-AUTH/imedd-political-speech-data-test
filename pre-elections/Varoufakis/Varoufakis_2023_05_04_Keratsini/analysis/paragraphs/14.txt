Speaking of design, there's been a lot of talk lately about a hangman's noose, have you heard of it? It's amazing. It's been taken out, says the New Republic trolls in their newspapers. Their channels have caught us, he says, in the act with a plan or, in the worst case scenario, Varoufakis says, and the day was thrown, he says fireworks. Now the firework is the pre-election hanging plan. A firework. It is a plan that is in our 2019 election programme. It's a plan which we tabled in the form of a draft law absolutely codified, just as government comes in, it tabled a law for passage in the House, we did it in December 2020 we tabled it. The Demeter Act in Parliament. We. When we did that conversation go talk about it. You don't interview me you interview me, we weren't playing. We did everything to hear the executioner's plan silence. We went so far as to shut down the City of Athens' technopolis. And we held a workshop, we invited the journalists, we brought in a great economist from Brown University in the United States along with Nikos Theocharakis, my colleague at the University of Athens, and we had a whole section that presented Demetra. We made a video of it and we put it on the website. In silence suddenly a week 10 days ago, they discovered it, they caught us with Demetra in our hands. Baroufakis is going to close the banks again, why? Because he says the Demeter is a plan to take away your euros. He said. Mitsotakis today I don't know where he was today, he was somewhere. Yes, he said, he says that Varoufakis says, he says, we will take you the EURO and will make them hanged and even when at some point he decided that he wants to be a little more humorous, you have to ask Varoufakis, how many Dimitris is a souvlaki?
