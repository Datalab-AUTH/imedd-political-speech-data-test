July 2019. Maria and I met I didn't know you before we met in the corridors of the Parliament. We were walking in. Here. We put the NO together in the House that had been defunded since 2015. I won't forget the first plenary session when you had to stand up, Maria. On the floor of the House was 29 years old. She felt incredibly nervous. She had to get in there, get up and walk up those steps on that like. It's like an archbishop's chair is it? Isn't it? The whole architecture of the House of Assembly is not reminiscent of democracy. It doesn't predispose you to dialogue, one goes up too high, looks at the empty chairs below and has to make a fiery speech as if they're full. Let us say and it is the very opposite of what a Parliament should be. I compare that to Mary today. With that Mary who walked into Parliament and I'm really touched, Mary. Why in these three and a half four years, Mary? She tamed. The nervousness. And she became the way you saw her today. A young woman. Who worked at the Butthead. Proletarian who when she looked at the Minister of Labor who had never worked a day in his life in his life. She knew what she was talking about. He was talking about what he knew, and everybody in there who had no idea what wage labour was, knew that they were looking at a man who had lived under her skin. What does wage labour mean in Greece under the memoranda? Maria Dynata.
