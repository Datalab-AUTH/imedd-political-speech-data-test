You have read about Attiki Odos, they are ceding it again, as if we had not learned anything from the Attiki Odos fiasco, and they are giving it to the Italians to take it away, he says, we will negotiate, he says, we will negotiate better with the Italians. The Italians have invested ten billion in our trains. They are not a bankrupt state-owned company. It belongs to the Italian Ministry of Finance. Go to the Italian Ministry of Finance and tell them to come and invest in Greek trains. They'll tell you, and here we are, son. We can't invest in Italian trains, what are you telling us now?

We have a pandemic, we gave them and 180 million for lost profits, not to cover them as some shopkeepers were given a refundable not to close to pay the electricity, to have some to move. Did you see anyone go what not tell me what profits you would have made if we didn't have a pandemic take And without not turning it back. Take what they did to Fraport.
