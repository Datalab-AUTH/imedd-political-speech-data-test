We had a period from 2009 10 to 2017 when we had a recession across the eurozone. Do you remember that? All countries were in recession. Not just us, we had the worst. But they all had a recession one country. For 18 months there was no recession. Belgium. Do you know why? They couldn't form a government. And because they didn't manage to form a government, they didn't pass austerity measures and they didn't have a recession as soon as they formed a government they passed austerity measures and they had a recession, so I'm not entirely sure about governability, but at least we agree that government that a country, especially when you have Turkey next door and wars and so on. You need government fine make it. New Republic, PASOK and SYRIZA the differences between them on the substance. They are zero, maybe none at all.
