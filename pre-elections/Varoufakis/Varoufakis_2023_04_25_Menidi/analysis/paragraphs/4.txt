Well, we are not planning to leave the euro. We are not planning to have a conflict with the European Central Bank, but friends, fellow travellers, comrades, comrades and comrades if they come and tell me that the way they came and tell me that it is not new. Bravo if they come and tell me that if you dare to put a cap on electricity so that Mytilineos does not profit, we will close your banks. I will say to him, close my banks, this is an act of economic terrorism. Is it possible for your partners in the European Union to tell you then that you know why they are saying this about the EHIC? If we don't cut the social security system, they will close my banks, you bastard. So I am sorry. I have a bourgeois culture, but there are limits though. And then if necessary. So I come back to the question of the paperwork, Elizabeth, so if I have to, if I have to, if I have to, if I have to. With a push of a button I have a national currency and then I print it out. That's the answer to a question from Elizabeth Elizabeth.
