We will black all these governments, whether it is New Democracy PASOK, whether it is PASOK SYRIZA or all three together, we will black them out, so we are asking for your vote not only to black them out, but to put forward our proposals. Like the executioner like Odysseus To take the positions that we take on co-option, on international issues, to be the only ones who bring the Palestinian issue to the parliament, to be the only ones who talk about a peace plan, on Ukraine, not that it will happen, but someone has to talk about peace. At last both sides are premiumizing war, a war that will never end. Never because its goal is to never end who wants the war to end? Putin as soon as the war is over, however it ends unless he gets Kiev and Berlin together which I don't see it that way, Putin is over as soon as it ends, if it ends at the same time Zelensky is over. If American industry is finished. He's going to cry. The arms industry and beyond. Texas oilmen have made unbelievable untold sums of money because of the war in Ukraine. It is a war that sacrifices people every day Ukrainians. Russian Ukrainians, Ukrainian Russians and various others. And at the same time a civil war is of course ultimately both within Ukraine and within Russia. So people are starving in Africa because of fuel prices because of fertilizer prices because of food prices. The only thing we are talking about in parliament is a peace plan with concrete proposals, not in the air, just peace. We have made a concrete proposal on how it can be resolved, which I think is perfectly rational to anyone we have told. Even to mainstream French, Germans and so on, we are told, this is how it should be resolved, but shut up. Shut up, because anyone who dares to go against the NATO line that the last Ukranian must die before we take Moscow is considered a Putinite.That's how it is, and we are told this by those who carry Putin's oil. We have reached unbelievable stages of absurdity and insanity.
