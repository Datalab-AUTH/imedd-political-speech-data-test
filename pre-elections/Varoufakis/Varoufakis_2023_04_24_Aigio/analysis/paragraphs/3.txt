They are also fighting over the have you heard of the investment grade. Do you know what that is? Q. Say you have a friend, Kostas or Helen, a girlfriend and she comes and tells you. I'm not dating, I have a mortgage, I can't pay it. I can't sell it. My income is not what it used to be. And the payments are sky high, but a gentleman comes in. And he gives me a credit card to draw some money to make me pretend to pay it off and now where he gave it to me at a prohibitive interest rate he gives it to me at a slightly lower interest rate, but still a much higher interest rate than what I can lift. What would you tell your friend to your friend? Take it get another credit card. That's it. The whole thing about the investment grade is that they're going to grade what we call the Debt Service. So if there is that view, view is that everything is going well. And it's just a management issue of which one of them is going to manage it better? The day 25 view is diametrically opposed that God himself descend with angels. This thing can't manage it to talk very specifically to give specific examples and then they start talking.
