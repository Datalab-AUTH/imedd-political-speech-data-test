Things are simple. The day before yesterday. We closed St. George's not if I'm not mistaken, it was 13 years since the first memorandum. Well, there are 2 Narratives here, there is the New Democracy PASOK SYRIZA narrative that the Memoranda are over? Greece is a free country, that this is what they call the European framework, but it is not European, it has nothing to do with Europe, it is the memorandum framework, it is the framework of the troika of the conquerors. So Souble and Sia. There is a framework within which we have to move, say those who think we are gone. We have escaped from the memorandum Greece from what we don't call in the day 25 Chreodoulouparikia, A Chreodoulouparikia. There is this view and they are arguing with each other. Mitsotakis, Tsipras Androulakis on how to manage this mnemonic framework. Tsipras says, I got you out of the memoranda Mitsotakis says what are you saying I got you out of the memoranda. Androulakis says, if it hadn't been for me who had put you in the memoranda, we wouldn't have come out of the memoranda.
