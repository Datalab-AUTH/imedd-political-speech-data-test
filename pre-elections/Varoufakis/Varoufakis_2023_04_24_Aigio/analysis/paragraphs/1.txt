Friends and friends, fellow travellers. We welcome the leader of Day 25, Alliance for a Break, Yanis Varoufakis. Thank you very much Maria, thank you all for being here. The Aegean is the only one. Provincial small town to which we come where I come I the kleon, Kriton, wisdom will go to others, but there is a reason my, let me share it with you. It is an attempt so to honor and remember and also to remember myself. My grandmother. Who is from here, she's from the rosewood Trissygene Economou. She was born in 1898 and died in 1983. So that's why Trissygene I'm doing today, so the exception to come to αίγιο, but other than that it's a great pleasure to be here. So, I'm not going to make a ten-cardinal speech, I think we'll do it a little differently. I'm going to talk for a few minutes to warm you up a little bit and then we'll share the microphone. Questions, short placements, so that as many people as possible can speak because through the conversation it will come out much more beautifully. So the issues then, friends, fellow travellers as we say on day 25.
