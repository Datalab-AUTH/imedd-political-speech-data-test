He was caught in America. Stockbroker in New York. Doing the unbelievably awesome. Then you remember 2007, 2014 Goldman Sachs and so on. So another great business. Commercial bank 1 1 1 another predator what did they do? Paulson He was making derivatives he was putting in boxes pieces of loans he knew were red. That is, they would not be repaid and along with Goldman Sachs had them Goldman Sachs was picking up clients, investors and some middle class people who wanted somewhere to put their money and they were selling them, that is, they were selling them rotten derivatives, knowing why they had made them, that they were rotten and they were caught imale. It is a valid understanding between Mr. John Paulson and the CEO of Goldman Sachs. Making fun of each other's clients and calling them sponges they were told. Sponges such that like dumb little animals, they suck up all the garbage they can find. Of these they were about to put him in jail, oil Obama Obama forgave him gave him pardon and off went the gentleman and what he did mostly goal came and took the Piraeus Bank. Because he can't get around New York. After that, because okay they didn't put him in jail but people know what a puppy he is and he came here. And under Syriza he took Piraeus in 2015 16 after I left the ministry, that's the situation. This is can we can tell such stories until the morning we won't do it Because I said I'll see you, I'll give you the microphone, but I want to say just a minute.
