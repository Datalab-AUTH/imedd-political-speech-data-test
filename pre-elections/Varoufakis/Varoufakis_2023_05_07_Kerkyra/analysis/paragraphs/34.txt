For example, you guys say, wait a minute, I've done it because I've had discussions with my New Democracy colleagues in Parliament. What am I saying? Do you think that 100% prepayment of shop tax is consistent with the viability of shops in the Greek private economy? You are Liberals, you are supposed to get along with the merchants? You go and tell them that 100% tax prepayment. It's in the national interest and in their interest. They tell you then why they do it, they won't let us who won't let us? The troika. But the troika, didn't you kick them out? Didn't they leave? Come on, we're talking amongst ourselves, John. And what's the next one? If we do it, they'll close the banks. They say it, they say it, but if you have a plan. What happens if they close your banks, you're a traitor. Because they are interested in not changing anything, in continuing looting This is the mandate they have from their bosses, from the shareholders of Mitsotaki S.A. Let's be clear. In closing my speech, friends, fellow comrades, comrades.
