Our goal is to crack down on Mitsotakiki SA, but not only Mitsotakiki SA, but also the shareholders of Mitsotakiki SA who are oligarchs. A vote for Day 25, an alliance for rupture is a vote for the crackdown on Mitsotakiki SA and its shareholders is a vote for the other parties of the meme, which talk about progressive governance. What is their goal? Do you see them? They are giving credentials to the shareholders of Mitsotakiki S.A. Did you hear Latsis thanking Mr Tsipras? For the Hellenic he handed over to him. They give credentials to the shareholders of Mitsotakis Inc. and what do they say? My company will be better. Let me make my own. I won't call it a "S.E.C." It can be an E.P.C. A limited liability company, not a joint stock company, be a people's company. I'll look after your interests as well as the Mitos A E. Let me do it with a progressive bent.
