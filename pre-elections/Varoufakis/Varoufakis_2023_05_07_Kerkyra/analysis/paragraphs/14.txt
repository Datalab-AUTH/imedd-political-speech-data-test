Because through this superfund, you have now seen, fortunately, that the Council of State has put their two feet in one shoe, in a series of decisions: to return, to take out of the Superfund, EYDAP, the Athens-Piraeus water supply and sewerage company and the one in Thessaloniki. To get them out of there. Return them to the state. Do you know what their problem is? That the statute that the Syriza people have drawn up, under the orders of the Troika, of course, does not allow this. And the Troika is currently asking for equivalents, if you take EVDAP for EVATH, what will you give? Because these are ours. And right now, in the Ministry of Finance, on the sixth floor of Syntagma Square, the bigwigs in the Ministry of Finance are looking to see what they will give them, so that they can take EVDAP and EVATH, so that they don't come into conflict with the Council of State. You will see after the elections they will find a way to try to overturn the decision of the Council of State, because we are not an independent country. We are a government, a state, a state under occupation. That's why we said that NO in July 2015. That's why we put the NO again in Parliament in July 2019. That's why we are hated and demonized, because we are the only ones throwing the ramp lights, throwing the spotlight on the 3 geese laying golden eggs. And not only are we shining the light on these 3 geese, but we have a specific program, Sophia Sakorafa mentioned before, we have submitted a proposal for a law in December 2020 that describes legally, technocratically how these 3 tents will lay golden eggs for the people of Greece. How they will be socialized, how they will return to Greece. They will leave the Cayman Islands, from London, from Jersey from Delaware.
