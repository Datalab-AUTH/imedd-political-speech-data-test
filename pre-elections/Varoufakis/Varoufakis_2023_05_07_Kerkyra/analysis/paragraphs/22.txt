Mining touches you here a lot. Because the beautiful Ionian Sea, if this mining takes place, will cease to be beautiful. The whole ecosystem. Which has created this blessed place. is under persecution. I believe that mining will not happen. Because their goal, as with the predatory funds, is to create profit out of nothing. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be ready to stop every drill where it goes to drill into the earth to bring to the surface fossil fuels from which we will never gain anything. Only the planet will be burdened with them because you're, don't make the mistake of thinking here, at least we're drilling here and finding huge amounts of natural gas. I hope it never happens and Exxon Mobil comes in and takes it all. Huge amounts of Billions what are you going to get? You think? Let me tell your drunkard nothing at all. You won't get it, Exxon Mobil will get it, but you'll tell me, can't Exxon Mobil, the Greek State, pay something? Of course, according to the sanctions, it will pay 11% of the profits. Not Exxon Mobil Exxon Mobil Hellas, another company, this subsidiary, Exxon Mobil Hellas, do you know how much profit it will have? Zero. Zero. Exxon Mobil Hellas. Whatever revenue they have will cook the accounting book their expenses equal their revenues. How can they do that even though they have a 10 billion profit Exxon Mobil Hellas. They will sell a scrap of paper Exxon mom from the United States to Exxon Hellas they will cost it 10 billion. They will calculate in Exxon Hellas cost of zero profit 11% 12% of zero what is it? Zero. that's what you will get, you will only get the hole, the destruction of the environment, the destruction of the earth, the climate change and they will get the annuities as they get your red loans with the energy exchanges, you see? That. It's not just a lot of money. But it's also a package that consists of a number of tools of evil.
