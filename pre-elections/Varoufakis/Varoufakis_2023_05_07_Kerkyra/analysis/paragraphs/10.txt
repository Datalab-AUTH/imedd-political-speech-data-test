Let's go to a second one. The energy exchange. Here they outdid themselves, they became the worst of the class. Who was the first teacher of the plundering of public networks such as the PPC? Thatcher. Thatcher, in front of these people, was a socialist. Don't let the KKE come out and say that I say Thatcher was a socialist. It's a figure of speech. I say in front of them. In front of these mugs. Even Thatcher, who I spent my youth protesting against her government, was better than them. Shall I tell you why? Thatcher's argument was what, with the PPP, the British PPP, which was public, it worked fine, there was no problem? What was her argument for privatising the British PPP? She tells you: Why should we, the public, set the price of electricity? If the private sector can produce cheaper electricity and give you cheaper electricity, why is that a bad thing? So he says to you, we will do this. What is the price of a kilowatt hour, today with the public system we have? 100; 100 Â£. I'm just saying a random number now. Well, here's what we're going to do. That was the proposal in the House of Commons. We'll fix the price at 100, which it is today. By law it will not be allowed to go any higher. We're going to privatise the PPP, break it up into pieces, give it to private parties, put other people in, producers. And we'll let the market see if it can get the price down below 100. If it brings the price down below 100, what do you care? You'll benefit. And it passed.
