That's the basic principle of Nazism that everyone is the same. The basic principle of Nazism. The greatest enemy of democracy. And since we had one of those? Just now here let me say a word about the Kasidiaris party. I feel ashamed that there was a Golden Dawn in the Greek Parliament. I feel ashamed that in the opinion polls the Kasidiaris Party is doing well, but comrades, fellow comrades, fellow travellers, friends. Will we fall into the Nazi trap? We will fall into the trap of heroizing them by mutilating democracy. Through amendments that will eventually turn against the Communist Party of Greece against the Communists and later against us. We will not mutilate democracy to save it from those who want to mutilate it. We will crush the Nazis in the streets, in the mass places, at the polls, in every street of the country, in every neighbourhood, in every alley, in every town, in every village.
