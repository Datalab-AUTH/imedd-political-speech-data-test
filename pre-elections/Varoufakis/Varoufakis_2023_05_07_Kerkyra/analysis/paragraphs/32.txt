The good thing about the demitra, apart from what I've already said, is that in cases of a banking crisis the system continues to work, because it doesn't depend on the banks. That is the beauty of it being completely independent of the banks and we said above if the banking crisis we are referring to is not accidental, but is deliberate, as it was in 2015 when Mario Draghi did everything to create conditions for a banking crisis here. To create a suffocation for a people who were told no to the cut in the ESSP, no to the creation of the energy stock exchange of these 3 hens that lay the golden eggs for the oligarchies. And we say Demeter. For all its merits it has the advantage that if we need to create our own currency, by all means. It reduces the cost of the transition and they tell me. You're talking about a new currency, a national currency. It's treasonous to even think about, you're not telling me you don't think the German government, the German Central Bank the Bundesbank doesn't have a plan to transition to the Deutschmark? It didn't say it wants to go to the mark. It's like saying to the Minister of Defense. Do you have a plan for what happens if Turkey gets into the Castelores? And he tells you yes and you say yes and you say don't be shy a little war monger you plan on war that's what they tell us. It's like going to the fireman and telling him he's playing with fire. No, he's not playing with fire. He has a plan to put out the fire if there is a fire it's not the fireman who puts it out.
