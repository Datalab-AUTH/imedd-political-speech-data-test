And that's what the government considers... Meanwhile, I have to tip my hat to the audacity of Mitsotakis SA and Kyriakos in particular. Really Kyriakos what can I say? Such audacity has never been seen on the entire planet. They come out and cheer and demand that you praise them for foreign direct investment, foreign direct investment. What is it? Where are they? Sounds good, investment is a good thing. Do you know what they mean by investment? The 3 grand they came here to make 47. That's direct foreign investment. That's the only investment coming into this country. Predatory. They took the airports. How much did they put in? Tell me how much they brought in. It's a radical answer, there's a radical number called zero. Zero. Zero. You know where they got the 1.2 billion to buy the 14 airports. From you. You lent it to them. From the systemic banks, which didn't have it, because you recapitalized them. So it's like coming to your house, saying "I like this, give me the money to buy it from you". And you say: "You're not good enough to do this". And I say to you: "Oh, I'll close the banks for you" because that's what we did in 2015. Why do you think Mario Draghi closed the banks in 2015? To impose on you the dream of Hercules, this goose with the golden eggs, which are laid by this goose, in other words you, your assets, the assets of the Greek people, to go to the Cayman Islands. So here is one of the three geese.
