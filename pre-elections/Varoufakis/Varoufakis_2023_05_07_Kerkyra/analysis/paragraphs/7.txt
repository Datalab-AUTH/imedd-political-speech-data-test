First goose. The red loans. I said it before. How does the system work? You know it, but let's consolidate it one more time. You have a guy, he's got a property, whether it's a shop or a house in the good old days with 150,000. Of that he had 50,000 in the bank. He put the 50,000 down, took out a 100 loan, bought the property 150, fine. Years go by, he pays off that 100, half of it. So he has now put down 50,000 down and has paid off 50,000 of the 100,000 loan. He still owes 50,000. And then comes the crisis. His income goes down, he can lose his shop, he can lose his job, his wages go down, his pension goes down, you know. And he can't pay back and he goes red on the loan. The remaining loan of 50,000, it's reddened and it starts with the chips and grows exponentially and before you know it, the man goes from 50 to owing 100 again. And then comes a predatory fund, under Hercules, first legislated by SYRIZA with the digital auction platform and the securitization and purchase and sale platform of securitized red loans. And then Mr Mitsotakis completed it with the so-called Hercules. So here comes a fund that can be owned by the banker himself. Or it could be owned by the banker, a politician, another predator from Ireland, an American. And a Ukrainian or a Russian - it doesn't matter. We'll never know that because they've set it up in the state of Delaware. All of this is in Delaware. Why Delaware, folks? It's a tiny state. Let me tell you why. Because the legal framework there allows you to form a corporation without the state knowing who you are? You know what I mean? So even the President of the United States can't know who owns this predatory fund? That's what the state, the state of Delaware, is for. The bank account of this fund is in the Cayman Islands or Jersey, a little island between France and Britain, where there is no legal framework. Go ahead, grind dogs. Whatever they want, they do. Tax havens. So here comes this fund. The loan that was 100, had gone to 50, and it went back to 100, for that 150,000 property. He gets it for three grand from Alpha. Here, here. It says Ionics.
