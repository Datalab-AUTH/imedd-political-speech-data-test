Well, that's what the free public digital transaction systems are for. We said in countries that have their central bank they build on the central bank, if you don't have a central bank what do you do? Demeter, do you build it on top of Taxis Net? So just as you enter Taxis Net, you enter to pay ENFIA, income taxes, road taxes, personal taxes, VAT. You have your codes you log in, you transfer money from your bank account to your VAT. What we say we will do we will do something very very simple. Something that is even simpler than what Pierrakakis is doing after the various platforms. Each VAT will have an account, you will have a PIN which you already have that is, but it will be even simpler. You will also be able to do it through a mobile app. We will also give you a card. As you have bank cards, you will have a card for the executioner in EUROS of course, so in the currency that is in force in the country, no parallel currencies nor executioners eh. It's like going with a Eurobank card. To shop for something from a shop here and you don't tell me how many Eurobank you will give to get a dress, a hat. I'm closing the brackets again. This system gives you, first of all, free transactions. It's important. Do you know that every year we as the Greek people will pay the bankers 2 billion in fees for electronic transactions, as if we had 2 billion to give them. For something that costs them zero, because when you do electronic transactions, the system works without work, without anything, without anything, without electricity, nothing burns them and the cost is zero and they get 2 billion at a cost of zero unbelievable.
