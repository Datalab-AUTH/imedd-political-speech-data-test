Speaking of the executioner, I'd like to say a few words about it, wouldn't you? It's such a great pleasure to talk about the executioner because? It is presented by the deception media. Like a firework. Varoufakis's Day 25 now before the election. It was in our election program in 2019. There is an article in the Financial Times in 2015. Back in those difficult times in June, commenting on my program. Of the parallel over-the-counter payment system that would be built on top of the TINs that are essentially. The yeast for the Demeter and commenting on it in the Financial Times, Not exactly a left wing tabloid. They comment on it and say it's a very, very good idea. By the way, if they want me to share the article you can see it. It's a very old idea. We are proud of this idea, it is the future of digital transactions. It's a system that when you have a central bank, like America, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan. Denmark. When you have a central bank this system? Digital public, digital, digital, free transactions. You build it on the foundation of your central bank infrastructure, the digital infrastructure of your central bank. That's what the British are doing right now. They're building a so-called. Central bank digital currency CBTC is called in English. The Chinese are doing the same thing, they've already done it, they have 135 million as we speak 135 million accounts. Chinese citizens and foreigners doing business in China have digital accounts directly. In the Central Bank of China. When you have a Central Bank, you build it in the Central Bank. And what is the target? To be independent of the banking system, so that there is a banking crisis. Not to be affected.
