A little parenthesis: have you heard them talking about Demeter? I'll come to Demeter too. And they tell me on the channels: Mr Varoufakis, in which other European country is there a Demetra? The answer is none. None, yet. It's the future, but that's another story. Look at what's happening. the Superfund, which doesn't exist anywhere in the world, doesn't bother them. It bothers them to build a system of public free digital transactions that doesn't waste you every time you make payments to each other or pay the government. They don't have a problem with innovation, that Demeter is an innovation. Proof: that they had no problem with the Hyperfund, which is the most vile, obscene and repulsive innovation on the planet. From this Superfund, meanwhile, their profits are immeasurable, the predators' profits.
