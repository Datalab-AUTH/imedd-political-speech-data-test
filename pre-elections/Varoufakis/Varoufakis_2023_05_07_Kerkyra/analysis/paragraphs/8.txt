By the way, do you know who is closing the banks? The bankers. Is there an Ionic today? They bankrupted it. Alpha took it over. Is there an Alpha today? No, there is, sort of, but it's owned by a hedge fund that you don't even know who owns it anymore. I'm closing the parenthesis a little bit, but I couldn't resist the temptation. So he buys this 100,000 loan for three grand. If this loan, the house that's attached as collateral. With that loan, he puts it up for auction and makes 50 grand. He's put up three and he's got 47. That kind of profit rate doesn't exist in California, or Singapore, or South Korea, or China, or Africa, or anywhere. You can understand why foreign brokers and their local partners hear red loans, bankruptcy of the Greeks and Greek women and they literally rub their hands together. And what do they do? They praise from California where they live, from Berlin where they live, from the Bahamas where they may reside for not paying any tax at all. They drink their champagne in the name of sucking up to the Greeks. Because there are no such profit rates on the planet. You saw how they managed to turn your bankruptcy into their own profit. Think about that. Aside from the social injustice, the other guy got a property that made 150,000, put up 100 and was left out on the street. The fund put in 3 and got 47.
