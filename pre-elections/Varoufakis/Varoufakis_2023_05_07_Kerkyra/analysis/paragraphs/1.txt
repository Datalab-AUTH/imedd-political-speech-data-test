Friends, fellow travellers, compañeros and compañeros. It is a great pleasure to be in the great electoral castle of day 25 here in Corfu, because as you know, you gave us one of the highest percentages in 2019 here in Corfu. And I think, as wisdom said, we have honored it. We sweat the jersey in the House of Hellenes and Hellenic Women. If you look at the legislative work that we have done over these four years or so and you don't have an idea of how many MPs we had there, you would think that we are a party with 70, 80 MPs. We were a handful of MPs, and the work that was done not only by the MPs but also by the political planning, by the people behind the MPs, it was a moving effort.
