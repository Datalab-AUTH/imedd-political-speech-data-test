Exactly what they were saying just before the crash of 2009-2010. Remember? The talk about the shielded economy, shielded banks, hard core of the eurozone, the arloubes of Simitis? Do we remember all that? They are saying the same thing now. Think about when we went bankrupt shortly after that period, why did we go bankrupt? We had an income of around 220. Never mind the many zeros, we're confused. We had an income of 220 and we had a debt of 300 and we went bankrupt. Now? 220 has become 192. And the 300 debt had become 400. Add to that the red loans. Add the private debt, which with the public debt goes to 700 billion. We are more bankrupt than ever. But, as long as New Democracy, PASOK and SYRIZA say yes to looting that benefits foreign oligarchs. Financiers, funds and their Greek stakeholders. Of course, they hide it and there is an easier way to hide it; how do they hide it; in the Mitsotakis years they added around 50 billion in new debt. 50 billion. Think about that: 50 billion in new debt - in a country where we give, we don't give five and a half billion a year for the National Health System. Five and a half, National Health Service, but that much for education, maybe 11 plus 12? 50 debt.
