It's going to be a long fight, we have 2 elections, have no doubt. There will be a second because the 2 big parties the 3 still just the third is not big. The parties of memorandum. They don't want simple proportional representation even SYRIZA who voted for it because if they wanted it they wouldn't use this obscene. Argument about a government of losers. What is a government of losers when you believe in simple proportional representation? If you have 151 MPs and you have formed a government, you are the winners according to simple proportional representation. But for that to happen there has to be a minimum common program. There has to be a common popular front to support a progressive government that goes against the oligarchy, but they are not interested in going against the oligarchy. They want to become the prime ministers and ministers again.
