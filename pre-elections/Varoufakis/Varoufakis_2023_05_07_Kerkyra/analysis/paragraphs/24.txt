Well, the Greeks are no longer suckers, we put the NO vote back in the Parliament. In 2019 we will now put it in a stronger one. And we will not only put it in stronger. It is a great joy. The fact that we are no longer just Day 25. But we have it with us. As mentioned in the introduction. Comrades from a range of movements, whether they're ecological movements, whether they're social movements, whether they're health-related movements, whether they're. Movements on specific issues like red loans and auctions. Whether they are organizations, parties like people's unity that our paths parted in 2015, but we met again, converged, and so we are proving to be friends. That the unity of the left is possible, that all we need. It is. Not to distance ourselves from each other on the basis of principles. We did not sell out of popular unity, nor did we leave ministries and cars behind and rejoin, we became part of the social fabric to fight for the NO that the Syriza leadership betrayed that night. The night that the Greek people with that 62% wrote history in the world history of the left, a history that we will honour and highlight and will take it abroad again. Indeed, after we have strengthened it even further in the Greek Parliament, in the Greek Parliament.
