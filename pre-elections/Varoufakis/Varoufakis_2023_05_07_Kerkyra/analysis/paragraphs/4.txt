The difference with 2019, the last time we were here during the election, is unfortunately huge, huge. Things are much worse today. Let me explain. The first years of the memorandum were a period of total decline. They bankrupted the Greek state in late 2009, early 2010. They loaded the largest loan in the history of mankind on the most bankrupt European state, which just to say it, you understand the magnitude of the crime in terms of shrinking incomes. It's like a friend of yours, a girlfriend, telling you that they can't pay off their mortgage because their income has gone down, from their shop, they've lost their job, and a bank goes to give them a credit card, so they can draw on the credit card to pay off the mortgage. Crime. And imagine if they did that conditionally: they'd say, "I'll give you the credit card, but you'll shrink your income even more." So that starts a debt prison for that person, for that country, that's what happened in 2010.
