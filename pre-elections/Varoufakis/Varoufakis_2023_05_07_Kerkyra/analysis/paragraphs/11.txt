These people here, they don't have their God. They created, he says, as part of the privatization of the market, the energy exchange. They didn't put a ceiling on the price, they didn't say, as Thatcher said, 100 if the market gives a lower price, that's fine. No, they said that the stock exchange would decide the price, no cap, no rules. How? On the basis of competition between the players who will participate in the energy exchange. Who are the players? Vardinoyannis, Latsis, Peristeri, Mytilineos. And a hedge fund, another predatory fund based in London that took over our PPC, the small PPC. These 5 are the stock exchange. So no need. Do you need to know a lot about stock markets to know that this is not a stock market? A stock exchange, because... Never mind the stock market. Imagine a farmer's market with 5 stalls selling tomatoes and potatoes. Is that a farmers' market? Can't these five get along? Won't they raise prices? The energy exchange they built is a cafe. A caf√© for the oligarchs. They sit there every day and say, "You suckers, what are we gonna get today, guys?" They may not say it like that, but they mean it. Implicitly, they say it amongst themselves. One of them says: "We'll give them 180 euros per kilowatt hour." The other one says: "Come on, you, put in a cup." The third comes along and says: "Guys, what is this charity? 300." Fifth guy comes up and says: "Don't be a fool, if we give them 400, they'll die and tomorrow they won't have to pay for electricity. Take it to 220." They cook it up and they find it, 220. Those are the rules of the market. That's not a market, that's a cartel. This is a nefarious mafia, which has the legal right given to it by the Syriza government in 2017, 2018 with the establishment of the Energy Exchange.
