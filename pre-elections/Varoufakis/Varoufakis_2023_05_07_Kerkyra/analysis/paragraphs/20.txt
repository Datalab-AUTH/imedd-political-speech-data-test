You force them for so many years to live off whatever reserves they have had savings they have had, you have an independent public revenue authority, the IRS, which today comes in every day and makes tens of thousands of seizures of allegedly. Forfeited accounts, pensions, salaries, money which they want to have is necessary for people to live their savings. So in the long arm of the IRS do you know that we are the only country in the world where the state does not control the tax authorities? Because it is not only the Superfund that A in front of the AADE, the first of the 2 a. The second is a beginning. It's over, but anyway the first one is an independent authority. Like hell it's an independent ADEA. It is fully controlled, as is the Hyperfund by the lenders from the foreign occupiers. It is independent of the Greek Parliament from the Greek state. Right now the Greek government, even of Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Doesn't Aadea control the Aadea software, doesn't pierrakakis control it? Ask him. He doesn't even know who wrote it, who has the keys knows. Imagine there is a company that I don't know who is in Silicon Valley, which right now has all the statistics, all the tax data of Greek citizens that the Greek government, whoever it is, can push a button? It ceases to have access to the tax data of Greek people. Banana country under effective occupation.
