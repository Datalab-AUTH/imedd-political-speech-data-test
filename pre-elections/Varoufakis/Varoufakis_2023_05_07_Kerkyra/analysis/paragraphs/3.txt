Look, the last time I was here, we promised that we would put the no vote in the House.  Because there was no parliamentary party representing that magnificent no in the House until day 25 came into the House in July 2019. But we are asked by the average citizen who may be somewhat frustrated or disappointed and out of the political process. "And what do I care that you put NO in Parliament?" I'll tell you why you care. Because that No was not a No to say No. That no was about the plunder you live every day, whether you know it or not that the plunder you live every day every time you open your utility bill, every time one of the servicers calls you, the so-called, at the cash registers to blacken your heart with threats of what will happen if you don't pay the instalment, every time you go to the supermarket, every time you turn on the water tap, every time you take the rubbish out. Behind all this is a private individual who is not an investor, who is a predator and who is squeezing out what is left of the life of this people, yours and even the democrats. A large majority of those who vote for a new republic are people of the people. And they themselves are subjects of exploitation and plunder. And let them vote for them.
