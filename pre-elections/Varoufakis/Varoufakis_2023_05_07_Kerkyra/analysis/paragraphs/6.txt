Because as I said, the first years of the memorandum were the collapse of the whole country. The ceding of it to the lenders. With all that was going on, I don't need to upset you by reminding you of things that you know very well and remember very well. There is just something extremely interesting going on. If what happened wasn't so dystopian and misanthropic, it should be a subject of scientific study and we should all sit down and bow down - look at what the atheophobes did, what did the atheophobes do? They created 3 mechanisms for looting the bankrupt, the Greek people. And indeed from 2018 onwards, if you look, there is a 20%. 2 out of 10 or so.
Of Greeks and Greek women who are doing great, unlike in the first few years of the Memorandum when almost everyone suffered from what are they doing great? From new production processes? From new wealth? From investment? They are doing well because of these 3 mechanisms of plundering the bankrupt. They found imaginative scientifically designed ways to turn the bankruptcy of the many into wealth for the few. This has never been done before, in human history. It is one thing to exploit a worker as a capitalist. You put it to work, the product is sold, you make a profit - Capitalism. And it's another thing to profit from another man's bankruptcy, to take another man's red loan. Huh? The bankrupt government bond. Loan, debt of the bankrupt Greek government and from that you make immense profits. This has never been done before. It happened in the last few years and on day 25 we were the only party that explained it, analyzed it, made it clear to the people in and out of Parliament and put forward proposals on how it can be reversed. These 3 mechanisms , lately I have been referring to these 3 mechanisms as 3 geese laying golden eggs for the oligarchy. Are we taking these geese one by one?
