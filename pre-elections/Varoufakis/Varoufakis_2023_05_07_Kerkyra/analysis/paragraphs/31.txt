We tell the truth to the world. We are not saying that the banks are shielded. Banks are made to be unsafe. You understand that. When the savings that are in have already been borrowed, they are already gone. Obviously a bankruptcy means a bank collapse. This is where Credit Swiss collapsed, the mighty, Swiss bank. Our people here say, what are you talking about, John? You're playing with people's deposits, telling people that the banks are not safe? But is it possible that they're highly capitalized? Do you know which bank had the highest capitalization in Europe in January last year? Credit Swiss? High capitalization doesn't help, if you're going to start bankrupt. It's the end of the story. And of course Switzerland also has a sovereign state. Pompous has a central bank that prints as many Swiss francs as it wants and we saved it. They didn't save it, it collapsed, they gave it to UBS as a package, but the depositors didn't lose their money. This is the Greek government. The Greek government, which is supposed to guarantee the deposits of the Greeks, those that exist up to 100,000 per account, does not have the Greek government to give them away if there is a bank crash, it does not have to give away what it has guaranteed to the Greek citizens. And there is no central bank to print them. We are at the mercy of Frankfurt, we are at the mercy of Lagarde. We are a debt slave reading and we say so clearly.
