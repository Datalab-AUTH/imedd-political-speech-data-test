But it was a period when everyone, everyone or almost everyone, 99% of Greeks were losing. Even rich people, wealthy people, well-off people, people with apartments with property, they couldn't get by easily, they might have property, but they couldn't rent their apartments, their houses, their shops, they couldn't sell them. There was no market, they went to sell them and they couldn't find buyers. They had to pay ENVIA, they may have had property, they had no income, they had no cash. Of course the working class. Women, young people, young people, suffered much more, but in general in the first few years of the memorandum, everybody more or less felt the cost of bankruptcy under their own skin. Since 2017-18, when Day 25 was established. It's no coincidence, it's the reason why Day 25 was founded then. We saw that the Syriza government would create a narrative of an exit from the memoranda, when in essence what we saw them doing again. They signed the fourth memorandum that, they signed in August 2018, which of course they called it an exit from the memorandum, because what better way to tell a lie? Is to reverse the truth, to create a huge lie. That's what Goebbels taught in his textbook on propaganda. Literally now. You reverse the truth, the fourth memo, you call it a post-memo. Which is a huge lie and then what do you do? You say it over and over and over and over and over again. We see it coming here that's why we made day 25 because that no vote had to come out of the House to stop the looting, which I'll describe right now.
