You haven't heard anything about this from the channels of the oligarchs. Is it strange? I mentioned some names before. Vardinoyannis, Mytilineos, Pigeon, add Marinakis. Put in Alafouzos. All the channels. That's all they needed to talk about these three things, these three mechanisms, the three geese with the golden eggs. Who? The leaders of the plunder. The owners of these three geese that lay the golden eggs. What do they say? They'll close the banks. He's playing with the Greek people's deposits, again a rupture. Another adventure. As if liberation and not occupation is the adventure. As if every March 25 and October 28 we don't celebrate as a people the fact that the only adventure is the occupation, it is saying yes to everything, it is accepting the fascist army to enter your borders. The only way to prevent adventure is to say no to those who are plundering the country and who, after all - those who are plundering the country are those who are sending our children abroad.
