The country is in a process of desertification. Yes, immigration is a problem. No, immigration of foreigners coming here to put down roots and produce and become part of our society. The immigration of our own children. Where they go. You know that we now have examinations for higher educational institutions. We have medical schools that after many years of study will produce the next batch of doctors. Do you know that more than half of them will be abroad by September, offering their services in Canada, Germany, El Salvador, China, India. Just think of a country that is poor, bankrupt, that has given so much and so much of the family's savings, of the public's savings, to train doctors. We send them to provide services, ready-made, in Germany. Is it possible? Not only did they get everything through the memoranda, but we invest in human human human resources - doctors - so that they can go and offer free of charge, as far as their training is concerned, medical services to the German public. And they see this as a way out of the memoranda. They consider it as Greece becoming a normal country. That we are back in the hard core of the eurozone. We are again an armored economy. This nonsense.
