Let's go to the third goose with the golden eggs. Overtime. Overseas. You've heard of the Super Fund? Superfund - in English it sounds even bigger. So? Like something that came out of the Marvel comics. Do you guys know of any country that has a superfund? There isn't. Wherever you go in the world, not just in Europe. On the world stage, you're not going to find a super fund. What is a super fund? They set up a company, and they put what's left of the public assets into it. What's left. Archaeological sites, beaches, highways that have not yet been assigned, shares that we still have in the banks, as the public. Everything that exists in this Superfund. Which, okay, there's nothing wrong with putting it all together. The bad thing is what? In the statute of the Super Fund, specify that the management of the Super Fund is in the hands of foreign lenders. We are the only country in the world, friends, ladies and gentlemen, fellow travellers, comrades and comrades. We are the only country in the world, the entire planet, that we have ceded our public property to foreign powers. This was not done even by the Wehrmacht. Nor was it done in India under the British Empire. It was not done in any country, not even in Africa. Under colonialism. They can pass the wealth on to them.
But no colonialist dared to put into legal framework something as obscene and vile as the Super Fund.
