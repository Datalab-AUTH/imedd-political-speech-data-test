Let us not forget another debt. Do you know that this government has pledged to give Hercules' predatory funds, minimum, minimum 23 billion if they don't make a profit? Here come the Delaware predators, they're looting, we'll make about 70 billion. It's our calculation, overseas, from this country. From this country they're going to make another 70 billion and take it overseas. And we have guaranteed them that "Guys, if you don't make at least 23 billion, we will give it to you." We don't have it. So we're going to borrow it. From whom? From the Troika. From the European Central Bank, who else? To give to the predators in Delaware. Look, if the supporters of the new democracy, the vast majority who are not haves and have-nots. People, knew what their own people were doing, at their expense, they would have risen up. They don't. Why; because the grabbers themselves have the means of mass deception. And what do the means of mass deception tell them? Every time we come out and say this 23 billion? Varoufakis was recording the Eurogroup, he is unreliable. When they hear about the energy stock market, us talking about how Vardinoyannis, Latsis, Peristeri, Mytilineos, CVC put their hand deep in their pocket to literally strip you.
