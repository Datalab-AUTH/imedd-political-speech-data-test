When we set out exactly the process that they do it and say what should be done differently, 5% above the average cost of producing and distributing energy, nothing more. Varoufakis will close your banks and take your deposits and make them into a hangman's noose of euros. In other words, black propaganda. The right used to say what it used to say, we will take your houses. We the Communists came the funds in their own and took people's houses. They were saying, as they are saying now about the deposits, Varoufakis will take your deposits, what deposits? 7 out of 10 Greeks have no deposits, they have less than 1000 â‚¬ in the bank. Have you taken care of taking the deposits yourself?
