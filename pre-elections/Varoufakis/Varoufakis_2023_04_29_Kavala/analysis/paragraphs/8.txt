What market? The energy exchange? In a stock market really in New York in the New York Stock Exchange, in the London Stock Exchange, every day there are losers and winners.There are thousands of gamblers playing They make bets They borrow to get some They finish their day and can't sleep at night because they are losers Some are sailing on a sea of happiness because they have made millions of billions. This is how a real market, a stock market, works. It's odious and this stock market is misanthropic, but that's what a stock market is.
