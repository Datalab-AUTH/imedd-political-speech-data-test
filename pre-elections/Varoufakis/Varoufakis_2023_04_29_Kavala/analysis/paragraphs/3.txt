The fact that they engage in blatant lying blatant lying? It shows how panic has gotten the better of them. Why? We have no problem when they take down Hercules for selling red loans, to exercise to read the bill, to look at exactly what is being done, to describe to you exactly what is being done and to criticize strongly, denouncing criticism of what is being done, of what Hercules is doing, not what Hercules is not doing. They engage in criticism of what the executioner is not doing because they have no arguments and they don't care. Ultimately, all you care about is Goebbels' tactics.
