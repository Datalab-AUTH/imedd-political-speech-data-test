Will this ever be implemented by the establishment? Of course not, but the only way to convince the man out there that, "Wait a minute, they're right." Could something be done today within the existing capitalist system that would give us a breathing space, that wouldn't get us thrown out of my store, that wouldn't have to close it down and fire my employee. So you can start a conversation with the people out there who are frustrated with politics. If you tell them vote for me to make socialism, you've lost them, we'll be down to 5% and we and the KKE and eventually the predators will continue to plunder our people and the working class will continue to either abstain and sit on the couch on election day or become part of Kasidiaris and Golden Dawn. If it can no longer contain its anger, because the only reason why fascists and Nazis grow in crisis conditions is because when the left fails, anger becomes a force of Nazism.
