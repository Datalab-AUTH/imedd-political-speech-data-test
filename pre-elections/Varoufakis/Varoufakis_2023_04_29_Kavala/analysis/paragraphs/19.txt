Our goal is One. After we have put the NO in the Parliament, after we have put the NO in the Parliament, after we will return stronger together with our comrades from the popular unity, from other areas and movements of the left, stronger, much stronger in the next Parliament, the next day to build the foundations for the new great left party that will aim to govern. Not just not just to protest, to govern. The only way to do that is to explain to people the tools we will use from day one.
