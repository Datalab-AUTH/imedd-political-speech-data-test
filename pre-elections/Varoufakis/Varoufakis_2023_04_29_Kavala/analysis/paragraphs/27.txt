You double the cost of the national health care system and don't tell me where we're going to get the money? It's not much. It's really not much. Think about it. The entire Greek state pays for the national health system five and a half billion is nothing. If you think that private people pay around 10 billion out of their own pockets, private people, private doctors, because if there is no primary care it will go to the private person. We know the private sector, it is highly inefficient in health care. We saw it in the video, they needed them when there was a real crisis. Healthcare we all went to public hospitals as it happens and when it goes to your heart you go to private, slowly you go to private it will slaughter you. You go public the substandard public will save you though. Well and an order of magnitude to link it to Hercules again I say it and I say it again, I have a hair on my tongue. As the Greek people, we have been guaranteed by our political leadership to guarantee the predatory funds 23 billion euros, a minimum profit, that is, if they do not make a profit of 23 billion euros, you will give it to them, you will borrow it from foreign lenders, the European Central Bank, the Troika and so on to give it to them. 23 billion. So don't tell me we are going to double the NHS spending from five and a half to 10.
