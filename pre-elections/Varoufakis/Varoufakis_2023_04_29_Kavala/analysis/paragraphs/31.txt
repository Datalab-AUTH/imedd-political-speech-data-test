Going now to the private sector have you heard the principle of the day 25 alliance to break one worker, one share, one vote? Consider a change in corporate law very simple, which says that shares in the company are like student ID cards at university. You go to university, you write you've passed, you enter, they give you a student ID, you don't pay. You don't buy it, you can't sell it, you can't rent it. You can use it to fill it out and get books, vote in student elections. You can go online through your department's university website, readmagazines that the department has bought for you. Imagine if stocks were like that. If they weren't bought as if they were commodities and sold not rented and given to you. It's a vote to all the employees of a business, whether it's the top man or the clerk. That doesn't mean you get horizontalization but it does mean that the shareholder meeting, like now, you have a shareholder meeting that appoints the board of directors will be made up of all the employees.
