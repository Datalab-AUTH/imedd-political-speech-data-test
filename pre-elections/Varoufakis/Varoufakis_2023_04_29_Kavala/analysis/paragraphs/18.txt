So I'm going to say it one more time because it's very important. The reason why we are making proposals that are being discussed on TV is not because we believe that the exploitation of man by man, the whole dream of capitalism will go away with the executioner or with Odysseus. But it does mean that the only way to have the possibility of a prospect of overthrowing capitalism is to show our people what can be done within this rotten system which the oligarchs and their horde of hordeynats do not even do that.
