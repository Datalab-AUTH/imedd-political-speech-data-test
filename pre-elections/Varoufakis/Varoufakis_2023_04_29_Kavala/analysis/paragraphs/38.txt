In conclusion. I don't want to bore you too much because we'll do this again in a month, right? They're going to burn the first election. We will not burn the second election, they will get a mandate from Brussels, especially from Frankfurt. Find them. If a bipartisan government emerges, if Mitsotakis, who has a tradition of defections from his father in '65, knows the art of what is in his dna, manages to corrupt PASOK to get some of them from there is the will and the Greek solution and whatever else he can find, and make 151 deputies, then we will have a Mitsotakis government again. So yes, if you can't, if you can't you have to get as many people as possible to vote day 25. That should be the message to people who are wavering between us and SYRIZA in the second round to get Mitsotakis out. It is a truth of arithmetic what I will tell you is a truth of arithmetic. A vote for SYRIZA raises the bar for Mitsotakis' self-reliance. The only way not to be. Mitsotakis is prime minister again is to strengthen the day. A vote for SYRIZA is also a numerically lost vote. You're not going to kick Mitsotakis out do you want him gone? Mitsotakis does not say Sunday the greater the percentage of day 25, the more frequent the chances of Kyriakos in how apostasy to stay again to reside in the maximu. We'll either have a two-party government if the numbers come out or more likely a three-party government. Mitsotakis will be gone. He's already got a job overseas because he's an SA, the man's a Mackenzie CEO, he's going to NATO, he's going to Coleman Sachs, he's going to go somewhere lucky. And then there will be a government with a straw man. Remember Papademou? It'll be a Mr. Alivisatos, it'll be someone I don't know who, right? This government will be silenced by Syriza with Alexis Tsipras staying out of it, but holding all the strings to keep the Syriza people moving.
