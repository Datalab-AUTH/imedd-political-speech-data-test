Dimitris Koutsoumbas asked me indirectly through a speech. Will poverty go away whether we have the demitra or not, no, poverty will not go away. But you know it will go away 2 billion euros that you are currently giving to the bankers to make transactions. It is not a first step, a first step, because when the bankers take from the people 2 billion a year, every time you pay with a debit card they keep €1 €2 half a euro 2 billion is that. You know what 2 billion is. It's weapons in the hands of the oligarchy against the people. We won't give them, we'll take these away with the executioner, will the executioner bring socialism? Of course not. Because it will bring socialism to get out of the European Union as the KKE says. I grew up and many of you outside the European Union and we had brutal capitalism outside the European Union. It is not enough to get out of the euro or to get out of the European Union.
