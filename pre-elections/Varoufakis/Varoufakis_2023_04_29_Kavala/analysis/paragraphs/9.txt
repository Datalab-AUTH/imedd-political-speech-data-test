What Alexis Tsipras set up with, you remember him, with my friend, my former friend, and my colleague, my former colleague, George Stathakis. Where Stathakis was coming out and saying that now from now on the electricity is going to be a lot and it's going to be cheap. The energy exchange. What is the energy exchange? An energy exchange with 5,000 people competing with is not an energy exchange, do you know what it is? It's a coffee shop. They sit 5 in a cafe. It's not a coffee shop, it's electronic. It's like doing a zoom or a skype, a watchapp. Every morning And they say the price to put on these donkeys here that we're going to steal and loot them? Someone says let's put 350 euros a kilowatt hour on them, the other one says, "No, let's not overdo it then, let's make it 330, they get along with each other. This is the energy exchange. This is the Roman arena, in which the rules of the market tear the flesh from the capitalists! Nonsense. They're getting along. Capitalism is a market that resembles a Roman arena for the workers only for the workers only for the many, but here we have gone too far, we have socialism for the oligarchs, because that's what it is. A whole state works for them. They don't produce products to sell on the market to take a risk and say that their profit is a reward for their risk, dear boy. What risk is bardinoyannis taking in the energy exchange? Pigeon.
