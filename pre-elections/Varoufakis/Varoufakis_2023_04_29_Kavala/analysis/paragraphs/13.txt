But shouldn't we denounce to the Greek people what is happening with Macquarie? How do we help the Greek people to shake off the narrative that everything is going well or even worse narrative, Do you know who is the biggest enemy of progress in our country, the left, the subversion? The sense that people have outside, not that things are going well, our fellow human beings are not eating fodder, they know that things are going from bad to worse, they see the desolation, they see the debt slavery, as we call day 25 they see it and the democrats see it. They don't see things are getting better. But what is it that is essentially locking them in, in the new democracy, in the system, clipping their wings, not allowing them to free themselves from this Old Party, not even bourgeois, oligarchic establishment. The feeling is things are going from bad to worse, but there is no alternative. Nothing can be done.
