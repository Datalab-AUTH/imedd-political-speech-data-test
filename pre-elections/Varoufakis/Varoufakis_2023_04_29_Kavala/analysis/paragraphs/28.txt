After 100 days. Here we need to have a long discussion. All of us. On Day 25 we have laid out some basic parameters of what it means to transition from capitalism to a non-exploitative society, say Socialist. I don't use the word socialism, but it doesn't come out very easily as long as there is a national socialist movement. I remember now the pachos coming out at congresses and saying here we are all Socialists and I can't have a problem. When I hear the Syriza people saying to each other, comrade. I can't call you comrades, so I call you comrades, I can't help it, I'm in shock, it's a psychological shock of mine so I don't know you.
