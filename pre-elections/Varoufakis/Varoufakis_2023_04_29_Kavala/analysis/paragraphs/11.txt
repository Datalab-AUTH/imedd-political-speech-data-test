The Makwari before it got the deddee had got many such public companies of the privatization and dosan Makwari. One of them is the London Water Company of the whole of metropolitan London. Tems Water. They took it for £5 billion, they loaded it up with £10 billion of loans using the company as collateral. And you know what they did with those loans? They didn't invest it in London's sewers, in London's water quality, they put it in their own pockets. In their pockets!  That water company. That's the one that has the bond.
