I was listening to Mitsotakis the other day saying, remember the imaginative thing he found against us, "How many hangmen will make a souvlaki? Did you hear that? The same day he had said something else to the laid off people here in your area he had said E what do we do? That's the market. Interesting, isn't it? The market works too well when it brings in revenue to Mitsotakis Inc. And the cost is the layoffs. In other words, we have a regime now that is not just exploitative. Capitalism has always been exploitative is the essence of capitalism. But here it is not pure capitalism. Think about it, we have a Patchwork, a mixture of socialism for the oligarchy and hard market for the rest of us; the rest of us, the have-nots, the have-nots, the weakest, the working class, the middle class, the lower middle class, the unemployed, the disabled, the retired, are thrown into the Roman arena of the market market arena, in which the lions tear their flesh. That is the market system, but for the oligarchs there is no competition. There is no such thing as the Roman arena. The great theorists of liberalism, the great proponents of capitalism, so to speak, have always thought, what they said, Adam Smith, for example, said that the good thing about capitalism is that competition between capitalists forces them to convert their own greed. Everybody is greedy, Adam Smith said, but because of the competition between them like mobsters undermining each other eventually the market forces the capitalists to serve the social interest. This is the ideology of the right.
