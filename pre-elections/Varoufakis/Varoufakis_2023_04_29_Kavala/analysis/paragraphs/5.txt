Before I go on Let me in the atmosphere which the periklis created read the names of our candidates in the 2 counties of the region, Kavala and Drama.
Because it is of great importance and for me personally it is a very great joy that not only do we have with us the people with whom we started with day 25, Diem 25 even before day 25 started from 2016 17 18, but we have new fellow travellers, we have new supporters, new comrades that we had walked together.
Then that first five months in the spring, the Greek spring that the Trojans were talking about and shaking. We parted ways because of disagreements, but the fact that we are together today shows that our disagreements were not strategic, they were tactical disagreements; plus we have what it takes. What a leftist, a leftist needs; the ability to put aside our egos, our bitterness, our counter-arguments and to embrace each other again and move forward together in the common frontal united struggle.
