Secondly, the labour market is abolished. There is no more boss and proletarian. When you're in a company of even 300 people, 30 people and you're all shareholders and he makes the decisions. No what you do the management together, together you elect the management. The management does the management but you decide as a General Assembly how to share the surplus of the business. Suddenly there is no profit and salary differentiation. There is no profit and no wages. There is a surplus. If the business hopefully makes 100 and its expenses are 80, there are 20 left and you shareholders decide those 20 how to distribute them? Can you divide it equally or can you say wait a minute here we have this lady here who, if we are all money, why is she writing the software? We'll give her more. That is decided democratically. And what does everyone get? Percentage of the surplus there is no profit and salary differentiation.
