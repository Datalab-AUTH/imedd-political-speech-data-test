That's why I want to welcome here today and locally this alliance for rupture under the umbrella of Day 25, which is expressed in terms of faces, because as feminists said in the 70's, the personal is also political. Here in the constituency of Kavala we start with bright from apostolaki apostolaki, bright who are you are here? She's abroad, we send our love to Germany. Despina Damianidou, Despina Damianidou. She's not here either. George Ioannidis, George is here. Michael Makarios. Kostas dwarf together we are from the first moment of day 25. As with Michael. George Passas. There he is. And now I'm moving on to the constituency of Drama, Maria Neofotistou. And Maria is missing. The girls don't want us to strike today. Apostle Prokova. Apostle. And Anastasios Hadjilazarou. Resurrection.
