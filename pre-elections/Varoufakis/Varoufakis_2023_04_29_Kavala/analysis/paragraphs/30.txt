This is for the public sector, for universities, for hospitals. Imagine a nice conference made up of conscripted doctors from the national health system.  Be the one that appoints and dismisses hospital boards. What could be more beautiful than that? Without going through the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Health gives the money. And it also does a general coordination. If you like the logistical infrastructure to buy centrally the state to reduce the prices of the logistical goods that are bought and are necessary as raw materials for the hospitals.
