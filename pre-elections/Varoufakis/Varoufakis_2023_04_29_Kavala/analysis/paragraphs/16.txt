The only way to radicalize it is to radicalize it, to say look at what Hercules is, what they're doing to you, how much is your house right now, how they're looting the properties of your neighborhood, of our whole country. You've heard so many times I imagine the explanation we give that they come in, they get a 100,000 loan for 3 grand. So that particular borrower may have already paid off 100k. But with the pancakes, the loan has gone back to 100,000 again. They kick him out, put it under the hammer for 50k, they've put 3, they get 50 at 47 they take it out on the Cayman Islands. So what do we do? We explain this to people, people don't know. And they don't know that all the money goes to the Cayman Islands.Nobody said that. And at the same time we're saying look at what could be done today, here's Ulysses, we're creating a public private loan management company, here's the bill. Here are the reasons why this law, if the Greek government gets it, would not conflict with European law. Not that we want to respect European law, but so that the other guy doesn't come and tell you what Europe will say. No matter what Europe says, there is a European law here, no matter how many pips are counted. Our proposal for Ulysses falls within the scope of this, we are waiting.
