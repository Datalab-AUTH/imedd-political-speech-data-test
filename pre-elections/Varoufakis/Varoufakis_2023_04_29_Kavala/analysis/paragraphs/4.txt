Goebbels was the first teacher of propaganda and he said one thing: To keep the voice of the opponents, the opponents of the Nazis, from being heard, you take a big lie The bigger the better and keep repeating it over and over again. This is written in Goebbels' propaganda manual. The New Democracy and PASOK and SYRIZA are engaged in the full full implementation of Goebbels' propaganda doctrine, as far as we are concerned, it strengthens us, it makes us feel that something good must be done, it can't be. It can't, if we didn't do something good we will be severely criticized.
