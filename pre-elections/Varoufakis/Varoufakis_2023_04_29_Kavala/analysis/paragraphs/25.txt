Finally, tax payments. Abolition of the energy exchange, that coffee shop we were talking about before. The first thing you do is you put a cap of 5%, 5% above the average of the average cost of production, so what do you do is you calculate? We know this RAE with this trivial energy regulator, every day they issue a rap sheet telling you what the average cost of production was, meaning if you put hydro which is zero, water flows turn, Turbine generated electricity free wind turbine free or Solar free. Good. Gas high. You add up all the units. You multiply each unit by the cost, the average cost of each unit so and you come up with a sum what the average cost of producing a kilowatt hour across the country is and you say retail will be that number plus 5%. Get a 5% profit. Why is it a little bit? Do you know? Do you know any shopkeepers who have a profit of more than 5%? They got 200 and 300 and 400%, 5% on the first day of that. The first day you don't need, it's not, it's not, it doesn't take a lot of philosophy to do that. On the first day it puts a 5% cap on the overhead relative to the average cost of production and then from there you start the process of putting back together all the pieces of the PPP that were broken. PPP, ADMIA small PPP and all the others, all the other little pieces that the single public electricity company broke into. You create a common entity and you make big investments in cooperation with foreigners if necessary in green energy, in the production of green hydrogen from floating wind turbines produced in the country, in Northern Greece they are floating between Thrace Kavala and Cyclades and they produce excess electricity, which is converted into green hydrogen, here is a development plan.
