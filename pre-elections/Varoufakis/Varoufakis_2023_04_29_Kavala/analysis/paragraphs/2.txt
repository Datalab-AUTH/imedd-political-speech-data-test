I will take the opportunity of something Pericles said, that they are talking about our programme, they are talking about our proposals, they are in a frenzy with the executioner.
But what is interesting is that the only way they can deal with our proposals, the executioner, Ulysses, the energy exchange proposals, is not to criticise them but to indulge in black propaganda. If you see Daily Capital All the mouthpieces of the oligarchy what do they say about Demeter? You will see that one fifteen-year-old student, if he or she had read the demitra for 10 minutes, would know that what they say is a lie. You can criticize all policies and in the demitra and Ulysses there are criticisms you can make.
