We The first thing we achieved, and I think it was a real feat, we put the no vote back in the Parliament in July 2019. We are the only one, representing the no in the House. PASOK First memoranda, new democracy with PASOK, second memoranda, Syriza, third and fourth memoranda. They have the narrative in common with each other that we are not in the memoranda anymore and that that no was an illusion. So says Tsipras. The KKE never supported the no vote it considered it an illusion since the week before the referendum and asked people to essentially throw a no vote. We were the only one who put the NO back in parliament; not only did we put it in parliament, but the day after we entered parliament, we kept tabling proposals on how, within this rotten system of the rotten fake state capitalist Greek system, the Greek people can be relieved. Why do we put forward these proposals? Take Odysseus as an example. We sat down and really got killed. We did too much work. You know we are not a handful of Members, a handful of Members who stand up myself, not me so much, my colleagues, the rest of us. George Loyiadis, Kriton Arsenis, Maria Apatzidi, Sophia Sakorafa. Who did I forget? I didn't forget them, we're like that. We lifted in 2021 these guys on their shoulders a parliamentary work that the parliamentary group of larger parties with 20 70 MPs have not done. They have not done. So we are tabling a bill! Not just a Policy in a 4 page pamphlet. We sat down and wrote the bill as we would have done if we were in government because we in opposition have a sacred obligation not only to say we don't like what the government is doing to say when the government brings down a bill, what would we legislate instead of what it looks like. For the citizens to judge it for the journalists to judge it for the commentators to judge it for the students to judge it for the people who want to spend 10 minutes judging us.
