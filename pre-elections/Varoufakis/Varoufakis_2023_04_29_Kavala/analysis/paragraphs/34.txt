This is our vision. If you like, it's a vision that has worked for some years in Yugoslavia, in the good Yugoslavian period, before they started to borrow huge amounts of money after 1971, which resulted in the collapse of so-called self-managed socialism in Montragon, Spain. It can't happen tomorrow. But it is important to know the break and we are making it; what we are doing to stop the looting, to give a bigger piece of the pie to the many and take it from the authorities, because that also means redistributing power. You clip the wings of the oligarchs takes them to the media of mass deception, the frequencies. You give them to the entertainment, so all of a sudden people find out what's going on. Suddenly you have media outlets that inform where there is a real dialogue, there will be arguments, there will be disagreements, but disagreements on the issues that affect society, not cockfights that have a goal that we don't learn what oligarchs are doing against us. And always the rupture must be on the basis of a vision left without a vision from an expression of my grandmother is like meatballs without an onion, it is not possible. It has no reason to exist.
