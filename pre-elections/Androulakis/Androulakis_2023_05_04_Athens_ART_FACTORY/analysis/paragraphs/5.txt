The new generation, as you know. Since 2009 they have been in a whirlwind of constant crises. It's the economic adventure. It's the coronavirus pandemic that of course left some good ones. Goodies like the Internet, zoom and all that make it easier for us to take these initiatives without meeting. We meet face to face. And of course, the energy crisis, the rise in inflation, the rise in commodity prices that have happened particularly in the most vulnerable economies that don't have strong institutions. That create a mature market. All these have increased insecurity, fear and frustration. They have trimmed ambitions, professional personal ambitions. And most people, especially the younger generations. They are so pessimistic that they have become believers. That no matter what they do they will live worse than their parents and grandparents. So when do we see? Graduates looking for a career in other countries. We know something is wrong. So that's why. We need to see the evidence that the government wants to hide. One in four young people today is unemployed. Or one in four young people? Probably facing the risk of poverty in the coming years. Also, growth, what growth? What the OECD has announced and what the Prime Minister is questioning is terrible. To even go so far as to question the official figures of international organisations, which with what they announce we have a duty to have an election debate and not on the basis of the propaganda of certain channels. Most of the new jobs are in the 400 and 500 euro range. Who can build a life of dignity on these wages? And with the state of labour rights in the country.
