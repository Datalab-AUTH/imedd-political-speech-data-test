And the other one is the cartel parties. I do not aspire to make government in Greece to be a strong governing party, and suddenly in organizations. In boards of directors to find all of you, as happened with New Democracy and Syriza? We are not building a citizen-client relationship. We are building a political relationship of trust, credibility and interactivity, so that we can discuss, address and analyse social problems properly and solve them with the experience that we have, the experience that you have and the experience that our friends who have left Greece in recent years have, and this is very crucial because PASOK is not a cartel party. And that is why I consider it a priority in our programme. I say it everywhere I go. That we must if we become a government. The main priority must be the de-partisanship of the state, i.e. transparency and meritocracy in the selection of the administrations of organisations. hospitals and the entire public sector, i.e. open. International competitions to make selections with five-year terms of office to break the electoral cycle, which can create problems in the work of these people with. Better financial incentives to bring in people with great competence, because at the moment what we are experiencing is that in critical organisations there are people who have nothing to do with the subject, simply because they went and stood at a rally on the side of Mr Tsipras or Mr Mitsotakis. Or someone else in the past to take a role. Undermining. Unintentionally or intentionally the public interest? So, that is why I aspire for what is starting today to have completely different characteristics and to be a truly new political mentality that the Greek people and the country need, both for the good of the state and for the good of politics itself as an object of solutions for discussion, dialogue and confrontation, but which always leads to a result far from toxicity. And discord. Now?
