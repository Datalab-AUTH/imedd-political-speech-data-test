Friends. Tax and insurance incentives, but also exemptions. That will affect every new professional, every new entrepreneur or freelancer. We believe that the Recovery Fund is a fund that we must use more properly. Supporting innovative activities, new business ideas. We are strengthening the facility in lending, it is happening in many, many countries, especially for young people, for schemes created by young people with a focus on the social economy. Unfortunately, in Greece these policies are very immature and of course we did it in 2010, we need to strengthen it even further, then in the first years we were in government.
