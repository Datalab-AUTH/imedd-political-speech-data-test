I will tell you some policies today. These are mainly for the younger generation, but not only for the younger generation. Which are in our programme. But before I go. To the political issues. And the programmatic ones I want to respond so, in a few words, to what I heard, but which I was not prepared for, but it would be good to say a few words. First of all, the participation of young people in the parties. The main reason in my humble opinion of the aversion of party aversion, because. Political debates take place. Parties act as hedgehogs that do not allow in an interactive way the participation of young people and it is not a current phenomenon. It is a phenomenon of many decades. I was often surprised that the Polytechnic generation considered it a disadvantage for people who were making a modern political career to participate in a youth party, whereas in their own years it was the common norm. Participation in a youth group and even those who did not participate were considered to be uncommon. So what is this? What makes young people averse to politics. First of all, it is disillusionment. It is the crisis of confidence. Many times they have trusted people and parties and have been overwhelmingly disappointed.
