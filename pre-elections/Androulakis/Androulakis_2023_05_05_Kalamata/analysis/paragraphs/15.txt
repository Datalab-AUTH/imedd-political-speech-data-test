Friends. We have said a lot of programmatic things today, in fact, it was the event where we presented our program. Our priorities. And the statewide ballot. And yesterday was an important date because we presented a strong network of scholars from abroad progressive children, a PASOK from abroad. Because for us, having a relationship with the Second Greece that left during the years of the economic crisis is not just a matter of one party. It is a matter of the homeland because these people have new experiences, new perceptions and can help on issues that push Greece towards a better future.
