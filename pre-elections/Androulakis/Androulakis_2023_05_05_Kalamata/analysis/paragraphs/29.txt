Friends We must also talk about the update of the ELGA insurance regulation, extending the coverage of disasters to livestock caused by climate change. Our country, which is at the heart of climate change, cannot be a country that this year we all say will experience the hottest summer. The Ministry of Rural Development should not give priority to a new ELGA, a new regulation that will take account of these huge climate changes at the expense of the Greek producer. And of course, the whole process for the new CAP programmes must be completed within a year with specific dates for application, evaluation and payment to end the hassle and bureaucracy that is causing our farmers great hardship.
