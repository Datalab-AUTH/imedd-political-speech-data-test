Finally, the land workers. Tsipras was saying whoever wants to come in 15 Mitsotakis is now playing on the fear of the Greek people and says closed borders, what do we say?The borders exist, we have a duty to guard our borders, they are not only Greek borders, they are also European borders and without the Europeans putting their hand deep in their pockets to guard our borders. But. Come on, everyone, you are all basking in the fact that Mr Mitsotakis does not see that farmers and stockbreeders are being destroyed by the lack of land workers. Hey, this is going too far for populists, with the tie. So that is why there must be support for this huge issue with a coherent immigration policy.
