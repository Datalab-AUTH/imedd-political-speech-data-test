We're talking about strengthening the special education structures to have the real school of inclusion.I go to many parts of Greece and I meet parents with children who have learning difficulties, who are on the autism spectrum and they say, you know, I have a fear and I'm talking about people 45, 50 years old. When I leave this life, what will my child do? Well, this is not a European country. This is a country that is decades behind and we have a duty to change it by making strong services for these people, our fellow human beings and their families. And of course a school tomorrow in Mrs Kerameos and we have 3000 psychologists and social workers, but isn't that how many schools we have? We have 23-24,000 schools, it will be very few. So we are talking about strong structures, strong services in every school, to deal with the very large and growing incidents of domestic violence in schools.These are a few proposals along with a strong public university, which makes public education a protagonist. Because we are not against having a non-state non-profit university in Greece. Because the issue of a private one is another discussion. Harvard is not a private university, nor is Stanford a non-state nonprofit. If there's a business group that wants to do a university with research, with campuses with infrastructure, let them come and do it. We don't disagree, but PASOK's priority is a strong public university so that every weak, Greek or middle class child can get an education without looking at their grandmother's, grandfather's, mother's or father's wallet. Because for us, the public university is the most powerful weapon of upward social mobility for every Greek.
