So we, because I hear some people from SYRIZA saying that we were pressured by the Troika and we made the agreement to sell the red loans, because PASOK was not pressured by the Troika not to do the law to protect the first home, but it did and SYRIZA is now claiming that they didn't vote for it. So that is why we believe that criteria must be introduced in the negotiations between the funds and the borrowers and we are not talking about borrowers, only individuals, we are talking about cooperatives. Dozens of cooperatives throughout Greece have sold their loans to the funds, with the result that agricultural property is at risk. So, universal protection of agricultural land. We stand in the way of the de-fellatinization of the Greek economy and regulations generous regulations and not to come the funds that are interested in the 15% that bought the red loans to make 35 and leave. People are speculators they are not interested in the future of the Greek economy. We said negotiation at the forefront with banking criteria so that there are long-term arrangements. There is no other way, the other way will be a way of undermining the competitiveness of the country and of course. The borrowers of the Greek franc. Our proposal is clear, it is 80,000 families, there may be some here among you.1/3 of the change is that one third of the interest rate is charged to the borrower and two thirds to the banks.
