So that's it? Which is the big bet on May 21 Is all this life-changing description to be put into practice? And obviously it is in our hands and in the hands of the Greek people. But it is also in the hands of every member of our party. Every member of our party in the coming days has a duty towards the history of the party towards the Greek society towards the great struggles of the change of the 80s, 90s, 2000, of consistency, of hope, of social justice, of national dignity. In the coming days, each and every one of you should take the cause of the rebirth of the democratic party into your own hands, here today from Kalamata, from Messinia and the Peloponnese. Your warm welcome gives us hope. It fills us with strength. But above all, it makes us feel the weight of the debt of the new change. That is why we call on every Greek woman to make a decision for change on May 21, to change the country, to turn the page and live again years of perspective, years of justice, years without inequalities, years of stability. These are our values. These are our principles this is our struggle these are our struggles for this. All together May 21 for the great victory. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm presence today and you can be sure that on 21 May PASOK will be reborn and dynamically return to the forefront of history for the benefit of all the Greek people, especially the weakest and the middle class. Good strength and good luck in our struggle.
