Thank you very much for this warm presence. And here from Kalamata, from Messinia, from the Peloponnese, we are sending a message of rebirth, perspective and new hope for all democrats, for all progressive Greeks. We are opening up paths of logic and progress against the establishment, maintenance, populism and elitism. You know very well that 21 May is a very crucial date for the country. 21 May the stakes are not whether PASOK becomes a bigger, The real stakes are whether every democrat, every progressive citizen finds his home again, the home of democracy, of respect for human rights, of prosperity, of progress for the Greek people. This home. That sealed the years of post-independence; that built the National Health System. Which built the strong public education that gave opportunities to the child of the farmer, the farmer's child, to study, to have a family, to succeed in life. The party that tamed all discrimination. Political, religious and united the Greeks without fear, without division.
