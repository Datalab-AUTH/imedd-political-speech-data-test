Friends. For many months now there has been another discussion about partnerships. What do we say? What is happening in all European countries, in about 85% of all European countries. There are governments of cooperation. But cooperation governments are not come and share ministries, secretaries general, governors of organisations. It is with programmatic convergences, with persons of common consent, with persons who can serve. These partnerships? So I believe, as a European Social Democrat, that this way of exercising power helps transparency, creates institutional counterweights. We do not have a Prime Minister who is capable of everything from sending the country out of the European Union to setting up a spying state to influencing the judiciary to seeing oligarchs in the Recovery Fund projects, because there are internal counterweights in governments because of programmatic convergence and personalities. And yet they say and stay only in the face of the Prime Minister, because they stay only there, because this personal concern of theirs does not care about the future of Greece, nor of Tsipras and Mitsotakis. The future of the chair interests you. So what am I saying? It's that. obviously he won't impose. One more thing. The faces. It'll be common ground.
