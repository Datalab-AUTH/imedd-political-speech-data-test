And of course what does Europe say? All of this is the European institutions coming to Greece and Mr. Mitsotakis with Mr. Gerapetritis saying, don't meet the Greek government. What other European state has a liberal government? Which has this kind of behaviour.But why? Because, quite simply, Mr Mitsotakis, like Mr and Mr Tsipras in the past, does not care if the country is exposed. If they cared about this, they would not have held the false referendum of 15 saying the people voted to tear up the memoranda and in the end we almost fell out of the European Union, so that in the evening, a few hours after the popular verdict saying no, Mr Tsipras did the no yes, this has not only happened in African colonies, a similar example has happened.
