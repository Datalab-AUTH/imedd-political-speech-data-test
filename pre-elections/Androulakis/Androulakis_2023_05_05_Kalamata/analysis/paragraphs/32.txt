Friends, the farmer needs a different approach with honesty, with integrity, mistakes have been made and we know them very well. These mistakes must not be repeated. We cannot have this incredible mockery that we have experienced over the last three years with the raisin product. You know only too well what has happened here. We have to end these games and move dynamically into areas of the economy where the ministry will plan, inform to make the farmer an entrepreneur and that is the direction and value of the existence of the state, of structured strategic planning. So that is why we are saying. Greece cannot be an endless hotel, this development is unsustainable, tourism, which is now very strong here, must be linked to agri-food with measurable data, so that we know every year how many travelers who come to Messinia enjoy Greek wine, Greek oil, olives and processed livestock products. Only in this way can we build an economy, along the lines of Spain and Portugal, which in the past imitated Italy, so that tourism becomes the engine that will support all the Greek people in the Greek region. To have strong competitiveness and to keep the children of farmers on their land to succeed and create families with dignity.
