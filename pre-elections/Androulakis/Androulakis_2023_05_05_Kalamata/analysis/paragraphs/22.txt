So what we say is clear. The whole model that has made high school and middle school a staple is wrong. Prioritizing kids in tutoring can continue that. Making it a huge cost to raise a child. Paying thousands for tutoring. While we can support the public school how; by changing to the model, it cannot be according to PASOK that a person's future is judged in one exam. That is why we are in favour. Of the national baccalaureate national baccalaureate is multiple exams in the last 2 years of high school and so there is a dispersion of risk and fear of the student and it also puts the focus of teaching back on high school and middle school. But that's not all it is primary and elementary. It has huge problems. What are we saying? We in the primary say every student. One computer, every teacher, one computer and every classroom interactive whiteboard to have modern lessons.
