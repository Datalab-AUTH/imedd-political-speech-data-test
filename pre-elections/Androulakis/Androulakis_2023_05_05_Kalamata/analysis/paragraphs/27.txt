In conclusion. I can't help but talk about agribusiness. We have also spoken from Thessaly about a new contract between the Greek farmer and the Greek farmer. After all, PASOK is the party that gave prospects and dignity to the entire rural world of the country in the 1980s. So we did; in this sector that was a source of life for Messinia and is a source of life for Messinia. We believe that we must take initiatives. This is where one of the most famous brands of the global agri-food sector is produced, namely Kalamata olives, extra virgin olive oil and other high-quality products, the surplus value of which, unfortunately, is reaped by third countries. The time has come to invest in standardisation and to put a stop to the bulk distribution of products at the expense of the producer. Ensuring the quality of agricultural products and supporting quality agriculture is a priority for intelligent agriculture and cannot only be a regulatory commitment of the new CAP, it must be a genuine national priority. This needs a new rural development plan.
