For Vangelis Venizelos. With the Novartis affair, he organized his personal extermination. We all remember what happened in the Greek parliament. And in the summer, with the wiretapping case, he also spoke highly of Vangelis Venizelos, because he considered his proposal and his view of the rule of law to be very important for public debate. Am I saying this? Why? And we will talk about the programmatic issues later, and we will not just dwell on them, but they have a very great value. Why? People have to understand, it's not just what you say. It's also who says it, and we have two unreliable and dangerous systems of power. So I call on all Greeks, especially the younger generation. to embrace their struggles. To put their hope in us. Because our word is credible. It is documented, it is concrete. We do not play the game of divisiveness, nor do we play the game of toxicity. We firmly believe that the Greek people will stand up only if the new generation stands up and even more so if they are united in the great global changes. This is our vision for our country and not a country where there is a nuclear accident in Ukraine or a war in another country and Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis fight over the slightest thing in Greece. So this is not a serious political system, the Greek people do not deserve it, the Greek people deserve much more and we are all here together to offer it on 21 May, building the new hope with the word of progress and perspective.
