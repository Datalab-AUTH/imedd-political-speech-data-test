Friends. I cannot say enough about private debt. Why do I hear a lot of talk? In fact, Mr Mitsotakis recently announced the 120 instalments that we have been talking about for months now. What do we say 120 instalments for everyone, for seven tax offices and when they meet all the instalments you get a 30% reduction from the initial capital and Mr Mitsotakis says we did it. Do they participate and how many have been excluded. This is the mockery of the new democracy that he had the audacity to announce. The 120 instalment arrangements only for a few people in the country. And of course the red loans. Mr Tsipras. He was saying and here he would have said it for sure don't pay seismic fees. Yes, yesterday, when he was talking about Andreas Papandreou. He said the following. He says our proposal for red loans is very realistic, so we don't say seismic charges. He was talking about seismicity, mocking the Greek people, in other words, Mr Tsipras himself was being self-deluded. In other words, unreliability and theatre on the backs of the Greek people, who have huge deadlocks and are desperate, seeing the danger of losing their home.
