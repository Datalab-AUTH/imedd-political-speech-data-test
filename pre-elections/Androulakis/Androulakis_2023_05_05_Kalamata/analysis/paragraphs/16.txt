So, we have some structured priorities.First of all, the cost of living. The cost of living and the cost of production undermine everyday life and competitiveness. What should we do? What is your cost of living? They are elastic costs. Health, education, rent.We say rent, we say rent, short term rentals are galloping. With Mr. Tsipras' decisions, the funds have taken the red loans of thousands of Greeks, they are being blackmailede new real estate programs are being introduced, which is not a sustainable development, a stable development. We are undermining in the long term our lives in our everyday life. In a few years we will be strangers on our islands, we will not even be able to take a holiday, a doctor will not be able to find a house. In Rhodes and Kalymnos so that a teacher can do his job. What is the state doing about all this? It's a traffic cop. Of foreign interests?
