Friends. We are saying that while we are having the adventure of the energy crisis, we are saying that there should be a subsidy for the purchase of animal feed, for fuel with zero excise duty on agricultural oil during the crisis period and of course it is very important to talk about the fixed energy costs. Why should we have fixed energy costs? Because. the war in Ukraine brought forward an already predetermined event. leaving fossil fuels and going to other forms. Energy costs are going up, that's a known fact, what we do. We put strategic fuel transitional fuel, natural gas that we do not own and that even Tsipras said that we should stop exploration, stay only on those that he had signed, so we are energy In blackmail from third countries. What are we saying? Priority to renewables, but how? Build a strong energy grid with high interconnectivity, so that the green transition does not become a business for 5 oligarchs with huge energy parks. We believe that farmers, farmers, cooperatives, processors should be prioritized to have a stable energy cost for the next 15 years by doing their planning.
