So I want to be clear around Kalamata where Mr Mitsotakis cannot co-govern with his own party. Will he agree with PASOK? Let us be honest; let us be honest at last. Mr Mitsotakis is not co-governing with New Democracy, he has formed a group in the Maksimou, he has even given ministries to the orphans of Karatzaferis, the most critical ministries. But he is supposedly a liberal. And he runs the whole state alone with his nephew until recently. And this man has a culture of cooperation, no culture. And I want the centrist voter to understand that with a strong PASOK we will have stability with a strong right we will have an authoritarian concept at the expense of the public interest that will make the state a spoil of power for the cronies of Mr. Mitsotakis, as Tsipras did in the past with Kammenos.
