So that's why it's my priority, but I don't hear any answers. Meritocracy, how do we have meritocracy? So I pledge that if we are a government, all the posts of hospital administrators, of hospital administrators, of institutions, of boards of directors, within 2 months there will be an open international competition. We will also give strong financial incentives to bring in people of high competence. Why managing millions of 1 €-1500 € per month? I don't think it happens in any other country. Why is this happening so that the party officials can put failed MPs in the party to take care of them? We do not aspire to such a state. We want a state that serves the citizen adequately. And I am surprised, but not a single person was found to say a word to say I agree I disagree, I did not hear any journalist asking them as they ask me urgently what I will do 22 May I did not hear them ask, especially after the tragedy of Tempi that scarred the Greek people, do they agree with the proposal of meritocracy or will they continue the viciousness of the party state? Because if we look at the biographies of all the protagonists of this incredible tragedy, they are all ignorant of the history of trains. Party children of the new democracy, friends of the machismo, with total incompetence.
