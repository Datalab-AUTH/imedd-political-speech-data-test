So what do we say? New construction.So that it creates a social pool of housing plus opening up closed houses. With incentives for reconstruction from the Recovery Fund and tax incentives low or zero ENVIA to include houses in the pool to build 150,000 such houses in all major urban centres to be given on social criteria to young couples and. People with other problems on social criteria. And so we don't give new property by making the citizen a customer, as the New Democracy program does, which is also for the few. You should know that most people are excluded because of the cost of housing today, but we are making a framework of healthy competition, so that through the 150,000 houses that are in common areas, the rents will be reduced and so the benefit will not only be for the 150 thousand families, but also for the tens of thousands of other families who live in these areas.
