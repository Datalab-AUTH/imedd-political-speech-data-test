Second point of inelastic health costs. Our hospitals. Our hospitals, the national health system that we George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos implemented. They are in good shape; we are in good shape. Proving to the European Union what Mitsotakis despises, the day before yesterday he said that we should not believe the OASA because it is a mistake not to listen to the OASA to listen to Mr Bampi Papadimitriou and the canaries of New Democracy. Amazing things. So what does it say third on private spending in health care? The Greeks praise us only the Bulgarians and Lithuanians say with the Recovery Fund was done in the years of the pandemic; why does Europe do it? The Recovery Fund? Primarily to support the health systems and economies from the side effects of the coronavirus. Mr Mitsotakis supported the health sector; 2% is the actual amount from the Recovery Fund and it becomes 4 because please add up the energy upgrading of the buildings; it is our commitment to make it 8-10% in order to revive the PASOK The national health system which is the party that envisioned it.
