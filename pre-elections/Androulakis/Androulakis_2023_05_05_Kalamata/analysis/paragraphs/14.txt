To be fair. This was the case in previous years as well.Because you can't say. In PASOK you are selling off the OSE. For 200-400 million euros, but then give it away at a minimum price? And endowing the Italians with 250 million euros from the barren lines.And making an independent authority where you put people seconded from unrelated departments, with the result that there is no control over the trains. To have a telecommunications contract without a single â‚¬1 of Greek money, all European funds. And to give 7 extensions under SYRIZA and New Democracy. And I say this because suddenly we have forgotten the tragedy of Tempe.How easily we forget. I want to stimulate the memory, not just to remember the tragedy, but to understand why our state is not changing, because we don't take the lessons of history, we skip everything easily, while we can imitate the best practices of other European countries and create a normal state that guarantees the public interest, where Greek children will finally feel secure and have a perspective. This is our great vision. A state that will guarantee that will guarantee. A society of equality and justice with opportunities for young people. How else will they stay in Greece? To have families, to stand up. If this state does not work on other terms than the current ones.
