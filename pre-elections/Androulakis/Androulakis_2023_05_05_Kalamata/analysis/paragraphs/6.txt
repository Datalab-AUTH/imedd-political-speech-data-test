I say this because Mr Mitsotakis. He says every day. That I have a personal problem with him. Why would I have a personal problem with him? I have my nephew watching him. I attacked his family. I had the Internet parastatals photograph him as an agent of China, Russia, Turkey. If possible. Did he do all this at my expense? Mr. Mitsotakis? So this is why the problem For me, the problem is not personal, it is deeply political, it is a political issue to send to the dustbin the stories, the practices of the right wing that Mr Mitsotakis imitates from his father in the 90's. 93. We therefore have a duty, every democrat and every democrat, to say so far to the New Democracy parastatal.
