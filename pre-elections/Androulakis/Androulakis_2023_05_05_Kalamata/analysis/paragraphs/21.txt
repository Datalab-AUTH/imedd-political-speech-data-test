Friends.Another part of the cost of living. Very useful is education. I listen to the last day again. In the usual toxic conflict. Let the journalists say. He was trying to serve hits on the narrative. Mitsotakis. Are you with the university police or are you not? Because it became university police and we know it or rather it did, but it doesn't work around as university police with our taxes, but there is no university police. And why we've been asked for so many years we've been told, you are and not following what I've been saying all along. Very simple, what's happening all over Europe? Security companies control the universities, students enter with a card, there are cameras in the labs that have expensive machines and that's it. So we have to make a new body to buffet the new democracy and in the end it doesn't work. The new thing now is the base 10. Are you saying you are for the base 10 or against the base 10? Mr. Tsipas, as a known populist, says, We have no exams, get in all of you, okay elections are coming he will say and as well as a car to the children. No motorbike all the same he will give something to get no votes.
