So what do we call cost of living? Social housing programme. It's an idea that came to us out of the blue. But the Portuguese have been doing it, the Spanish have been doing it, the Italians have been doing it, the Germans have been doing it, the Austrians have been doing it for many decades. Why shouldn't Greece do it? They give us the money from the Recovery Fund. 20,000 houses, Portuguese. 10,000 Spaniards, 11 Italians thousands of 100 houses. Mr Mitsotakis 70 in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. This is his perception of the cost of living for the Greek people. 100 houses compared to the thousands that other traitorous governments said they put into the development programme.
