I do not aspire to impose on any person. The persons will be of common consent. And if they think and want an excuse, why not suggest them? It is because the problems facing the country have been decided. They are their protagonists and not only now, but since the bankruptcy of Karamanlis and afterwards, because they never gave consent, never gave a helping hand, never spoke the word of realism, consistency, responsibility; they were only interested in conquering power with the Zapiaia, with the Thessaloniki programs and all these unbelievable things, the unbelievable mockeries that they then christened as illusions. To take the blame for the problems.
