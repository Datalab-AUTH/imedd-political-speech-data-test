Why Mr Tsipras? And he says, "Don't you own Andreas Papandreou? We don't own Andreas Papandreou. So let's be philosophical about it. Andreas Papandreou. He belongs to history; he is the greatest democratic leader since the Second World War. In the DNA of the democratic party. There are 2 faces, there are 2 faces that symbolize Greece of realism and progress 2 faces. The great Eleftherios Venizelos. The great Andreas Papandreou. We. We don't have property rights, we have something much bigger. Mr Tsipras, we are the continuators of the traditions, principles and values of the historic democratic party. And we don't expect anyone to stamp us with a political passport. Nor property titles. But let us tell the truth. Who is closer to Andreas Papandreou? The leader of the party that Andreas Papandreou founded or the leader of the party that led him and tried in the Special Court to lock him up in the prison that organized his personal extermination together with Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy? You know Mr Tsipras has a talent for falsification; for distortion. Because. The criteria and the level of political morality are measured very differently.
