So why is it necessary for the future of the country to revive the democratic party? Because, quite simply, our political opponents have only one weapon in their hands. To divide the Greek people. They have set up 2 paracratic mechanisms on the Internet. They are trying to discredit authoritative journalism; politicians who speak programmatically to those people who are fighting for something new and different, keeping the country tied to a very bad past, a past we thought we had left behind decades ago. It is no coincidence, after all, that these two parties. From 2014 onwards. I can say even before that if we consider the date when Mr. Karamanlis handed over a bankrupt Greece to PASOK as a milestone from that moment they started to fight fiercely against PASOK, they tried to blame everything on a party which historically offered many times more to the country than they did and even today they try to use PASOK's reforms. But which they never voted for. What did the Left and Right support in Greece? The reforms in local government; here it is in Many local politicians who remember if they ever supported the great reforms of decentralization of the state and regional development; the reforms of transparency? The reforms of meritocracy? The Assep? The clarity? Or the reforms that built the rule of law making Greece a normal European country? And I'm talking about independent authorities and the separation of powers, the autonomy of the judiciary. None of this was supported by them, which is why today they do not respect all this titanic work and they do not respect him, because inequalities have escalated.
