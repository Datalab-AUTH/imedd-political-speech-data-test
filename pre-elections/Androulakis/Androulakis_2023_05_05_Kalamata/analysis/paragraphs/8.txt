So let's not talk about the distant past, which is not so distant, let's talk about the recent past. George Papandreou. He took over a bankrupt Greece. And with the truth to the Greek people. Mr. Tsipras. He christened him Pinochet. He identified George Papandreou with the murderous dictator of Chile. And a few months ago he was saying that it was probably Mr. Karamanlis who bankrupted Greece and that George Papandreou was right, while for a few months he was blaming Karamanlis, reversing his narrative. He's going to Serres. While he has already put his close associate and press spokesman Mr. Antonaros on his ballot papers. And he speaks highly of Mr Karamanlis.
