Friends, thank you very much for your warm welcome, which is another message of victory. It is another message that the democratic party is back in the political spotlight of the country. Friends, we are fighting a daily struggle, a national struggle, a patriotic and not a party struggle, because we have a duty on 21 May to let the sun of hope, perspective, social justice and national dignity rise again. The sun that gave the Greek people the best years, the years of post-independence. We have a duty to fight against two systems of power that divide the Greek people, that fight only for chairs and that have an incredible audacity against the democratic party.
