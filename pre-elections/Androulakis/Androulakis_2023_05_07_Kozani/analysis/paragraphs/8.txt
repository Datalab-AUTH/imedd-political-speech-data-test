But, friends, let us look to the future, let us look ahead, why PASOK? What is the reason? Beyond the deep historical and social roots, the footprint, the great projects, infrastructure, hospitals, the NHS, public universities, independent authorities, proud foreign policy, patriotic stance on national issues. When have we ever had New Democracy and Syriza as our companions? What did they support of all this? The ASEP? Transparency? The protection of the first home? Which of PASOK's great reforms are they trying to appropriate? They supported with their vote in the Greek parliament. They have always been enemies of change and both of them were conscious enemies of the great changes made by PASOK to make Greece a normal European country and to make its people stand up proudly in international competition. So let's go to the future. What are we doing today? What is our programme? Why are we talking about European social democracy? Why are we proposing a strong welfare state and a truly competitive productive base? Because our people simply will not stand for it. Our people cannot afford any more inequalities. Our young people cannot go abroad by the tens of thousands because they have no prospects and no future here. The country is collapsing demographically. What do we do? We continue to listen to the Internet parasite. Killing themselves for nothing. If there is a nuclear accident in Ukraine, Tsipras and Mitsotakis will be fighting in Greece.
