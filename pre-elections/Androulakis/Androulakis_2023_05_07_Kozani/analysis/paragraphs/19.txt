That is why social democracy is needed, because it speaks nationally, socially, patriotically, with a people-centred approach, with a focus on the poorest regions, with a focus on new growth that is sustainable and provides good jobs for your children. Imagine if SYRIZA or New Democracy continue to be at the helm of power. What is the future for your families? So, are the people who created all these problems going to solve them for you? But they have not solved them in the last eight and a half years. That is why I say here from Kozani and Western Macedonia: give me the power to make the power systems of Tsipras and Mitsotakis, which undermine the public interest for the benefit of the domestic oligarchy, for the benefit of the chair, for the benefit of their parties, a thing of the past.
