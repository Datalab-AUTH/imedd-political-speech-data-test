Friends, we have a duty on May 21, with a strong PASOK-Movement for Change, to mark the inglorious end of these two closed systems of power. Those who change the election narratives like shirts. On the one hand they want self-reliance. The other they want a government with a vote of acquiescence. One day with Varoufakis, the next they denounce Varoufakis, the next they say come PASOK to work together, but we can't have a programmatic convergence in 3 days. So what do you want? All they want is not to cooperate with PASOK, but to end PASOK. They don't want our cooperation, they want your votes to continue their unrepentant games. So give a message of change. The democratic party is back as a protagonist to put the practices of hatred, discord and denigration in the dustbin of history.
