So what are we saying? First of all, rents. In all urban centres, rents are rising. We are saying as in all serious European countries a social housing reservoir, 150,000 houses for 150,000 new couples, for poor Greeks with low rents to be built either by the Recovery Fund or with tax incentives and incentives for reconstruction, to open up old houses. Already in Thessaloniki, 15,000 have been registered in the houses. So if we give reconstruction incentives, zero ENVIA and low rent for 15 years, thousands of our fellow citizens will find cheap housing, they will have families and of course this will help the regions, the residential areas, with competition to bring down rents in general and not say, we will give you new property, as Mr Mitsotakis says, and young people will go and see that because of the cost per square metre they cannot join these programmes. Second issue. Very important. And probably to wrap this up and see the disregard for simple logic. The New Republic says they knew the problem and they are striving to solve it. I want you to know that in the Recovery Fund the Portuguese put 26,000 new houses. Billions of euros from Europe, not a penny of their own money. 20,000 Spanish, 10,000 Italians. Thousands of Germans. Thousands of Austrians. And Mr Mitsotakis, in contempt of the younger generation, put up 100 houses, 70 in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. This is the social face of the conservative party that disdains and disrespects the problems of the younger generation, pretending not to see the demographic projectile.
