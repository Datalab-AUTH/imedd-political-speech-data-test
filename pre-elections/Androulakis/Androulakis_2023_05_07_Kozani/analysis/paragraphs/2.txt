I heard Mr Mitsotakis say today that I have a personal problem with him. He probably thinks that I put my nephew on his tail and not him on his. I also heard him say that PASOK, the PASOK of the new era, is closer to Mr Tsipras' Syriza. Who is Mr Mitsotakis addressing? To the Greek people, to their memory? Or is he addressing the mass media, which reproduce misery, lies and fake news to people who have forgotten what happened in the last 15 years? So let the Greek people here today from Kozani, from Western Macedonia, think about who is closer to Tsipras? Me or Mitsotakis? Which party will always be on the right side of history, PASOK or New Democracy? So let's put them in order. If in 2010 the majority of our MPs voted for what Tsipras and Mitsotakis voted for together, we would be in the drachma today because they were on the same front against reason, for the bankruptcy of the country, but they pretend not to remember. And because Mr Mitsotakis has probably forgotten, I call on his sister, Mrs Bakoyannis, who voted for the loan agreement at the time, to remind him who was on the right side of history. Who is closer to the practices of Mr Tsipras and Mr Polakis in attacking independent authorities? Me or Mr Mitsotakis? Have you ever heard any member of PASOK attacking the principles that PASOK itself created in order to have a strong democracy and the rule of law? Just as SYRIZA executives attacked the independent authorities from '15 to '19, in the same fierce way Georgiades and others are attacking today against Rammos and all those who fought to expose the wiretapping parastate. So we are not like them. They are absolutely the same. And if they think they are not the same, their practices are certainly identical.
