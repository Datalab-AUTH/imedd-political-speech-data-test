Friends, we must speak to memory because they are constantly trying to present another reality. Mr Mitsotakis said that we have very big political differences. Yes, we do have huge political and moral differences. I did not have anyone in my entourage who was involved in the scandals that his closest associate, his nephew, is involved in. Mr Tsipras had his best friend convicted 13-0 by the Special Court and had him on SYRIZA's ballot papers, instead of sending him home, just as Mr Mitsotakis did not let the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry do its job and bring Mr Demetriades to justice. So they are similar there too. Where do they differ? They differ in the fact that we are not looking for a measuring tape to see where we are closest to each other, because they are on the same side of the river and we are on the opposite side, because we are fighting for values, for democracy, with the sole aim of prosperity and respect for human rights. You won't see in PASOK the phenomena of Patsy. You will not see in the PASOK the phenomena of the client state, which had the audacity to say yesterday that the PASOK of my time is against meritocracy, because it says we did not vote for the evaluation of teachers. But the evaluation was carried out by meritocratic structures and not by an army of New Democracy's temporary employees; obviously we are in favour of evaluation.
