Friends. Many important projects I can say for your area, as I will meet next with the local government on the issue of the bridge of Servia, which remains closed, another issue that must be addressed to stop the bisection of the municipality in two. All these problems show that when a region like yours, which is going through what it is going through demographically and economically, is not a priority for the country, then unfortunately the public interest is at risk along with all of you.
