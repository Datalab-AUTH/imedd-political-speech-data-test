So let me start with the big issue of the day, which is the cost of living. Wages are rising very slowly and the cost of living is galloping. So because Mr Mitsotakis's pledges that wages will increase by 25% over the next four years are a mockery, just like many of Mr Karamanlis's and Mr Tsipras's, because they are of the same populist school. I say to you that we have another priority. To reduce the cost of living that and as long as wages increase to more than cover the problem and not consider every month looking at supermarket prices, looking at how you will get there in the first fortnight. This is what is happening with the younger generations.
