So that is why I say to you, our struggle is not, dear friends, to win only a seat in Kozani or to go to a strong double-digit number. The real struggle, the duty of each and every one of you is that on May 21, the home of every democrat, every progressive Greek, becomes big again to embrace real struggles and give real hope to all generations. And I am glad that all generations are here today, the generation that founded PASOK and the generation that raised PASOK and my generation that will rebirth PASOK, the great movement of Andreas Papandreou. But for that we have come to Andreas Papandreou, where many claim the dowry of the founder of PASOK, the same man they did everything they could to wipe off the political map of the country. I heard Mr Tsipras say yesterday that Andreas said that the only opponent was the right. Tsipras forgets that it was Andreas who sent the right-wing of the post-civil war state into the dustbin of history, and it was Andreas whose own fellow travellers at the time did everything they could with the right-wing that he locked in the dustbin to take him to the Special Court and to prison. But do you know? There is no limit to the audacity. Is Mr. Tsipras giving PASOK lessons in anti-rightism? Please see our ballot papers. Our ballots do not include the far-rightists of Kammenos, nor the so-called supporters of Karamanlis who supported the bankruptcy of the country and which PASOK lifted up, sacrificing a huge amount of its political capital. So the gentlemen of SYRIZA should not look for the Right in us because they have it on their ballots.
