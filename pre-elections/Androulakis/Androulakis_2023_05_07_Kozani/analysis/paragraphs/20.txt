I cannot conclude without saying a few words about our national issues. It is absurd that there is no national understanding. And Mr Mitsotakis has the nerve to say that PASOK is a party that does not want to have an understanding. Isn't it we who voted to strengthen the country's deterrent power with France? This year, are we not the ones who voted for the country's armaments? This year, is it not we who supported the health protection of the Greek people? Isn't it us who, in all the bills that provide solutions to problems, had the voice of reason? What did SYRIZA do, Mr Mitsotakis? But more importantly, what have you done, Mr Mitsotakis? So populists with or without a tie cannot give lessons in logic and consistency to the party of Andreas Papandreou, who holds high the flag of national consensus on the great issues of the nation. So we invite them to tell us their positions, what do they say, what do we do about Turkey? What do we expect from next Sunday's elections? I listened carefully to Mr Tsipras saying when he met the Chancellor of Germany that if Turkey changes its government, that is Mr Kilicaroglu, he will go ahead, he says, with a discussion on the Aegean Prespes. Andreas Papandreou and Aegean Prespes do not go together to end the mockery of the Greek people. Because you cannot say that you have a credible interlocutor in someone who talks about many islands that are in the grey zone or someone else who makes a spot on the Turkish elections by putting the islands of the North-Eastern Aegean and Western Thrace in red. If Mr Tsipras is going to find solutions with them, he had better go home too, because we have seen how he has handled our national issues with dignity.
