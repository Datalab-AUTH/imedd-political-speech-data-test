Friends. So, we have a policy that does not lead Western Macedonia to desertification but gives it a perspective for a just energy transition that will become a reality, as has happened in other advanced European countries. That is why we are proposing to maintain the energy brand name of the regions, to ensure district heating in all cities in the region. Complete land regeneration and environmental restoration of landscapes, retraining and utilisation of human resources and incentives for new professional activities. For example, agrotourism. Modern infrastructure with an emphasis on green transport. After the Tempi tragedy, did any of those with huge responsibility for the tragedy think that the train is the only green means of transport of the time, which all European countries are investing billions in, and that a strong network linking Greece with the central European countries should be started here in Western Macedonia? But when? When the money of the Recovery Fund runs out will we say all this? Then where will the next government come in and say what to do? We don't have any more money, evil Europe is not giving it. But when Europe did give it, that money became an expanded NSRF at the expense of the country's infrastructure. This is the government of Mr Mitsotakis.
