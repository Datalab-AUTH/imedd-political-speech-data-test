Homeland, a big thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Democratic Heraklion sends a message of joy, hope, victory and the rebirth of the democratic party. Here in Heraklion, the historic castle of PASOK. In the square where Andreas Papandreou loved and adored. Here again we begin by picking up the thread of history. Here in this square. In 1985 I first heard our founder Andreas Papandreou as a child. It was here in this square that I heard the late George Gennimata in 1993. Here in this square today, after many decades, I come. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Because you are once again proudly raising the flag of PASOK, the sun, the sun of optimism, the sun of hope, the sun of social justice and our national dignity. PASOK is here, united, strong. All generations of the Democratic Party are here in Democratic Heraklion, sending a message from all corners of the country. The Democratic Party, the people-born movement of May 21, is once again becoming the protagonist of developments. We have a national debt. We have a national debt. We have a national debt on May 21 to revive our movement, because it is a one-way street for Greece to become strong again and the Greek people to become proud.
