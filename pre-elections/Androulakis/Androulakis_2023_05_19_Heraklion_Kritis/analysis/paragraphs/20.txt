I am addressing all of them today from Heraklion and I call on them on Sunday to give us a strong mandate. We will not let them down. With this programme we are building a new relationship of trust with every Greek for a Greece of decency, dignity, meritocracy, a real productive economy, knowledge and sustainable development. We are indebted to the welfare state, strong cohesion and the rule of law is the vision of every European people. We have no room for manoeuvre. There are only a few hours left until Sunday and we must fight together, all together, to guarantee the Greek people the brave changes that our country needs, the changes that give a real perspective to the new generation. Only PASOK can be the progressive alternative to what we are experiencing under Mr Mitsotakis' cruel system.
