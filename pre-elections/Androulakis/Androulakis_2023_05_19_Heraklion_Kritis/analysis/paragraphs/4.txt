Today the square of Democratic Heraklion shows who the real opponent of the Right is. Already Mitsotakis would be a thing of the past if it were not for Mr. Tsipras. That is why on May 21 the real opponent of New Democracy is reborn. But what did Mr Tsipras do about Golden Dawn? The so-called leftist, the so-called progressive? The day before yesterday, the unscrupulous Mr Tsipras invited the misguided voters of Golden Dawn to vote for him.
