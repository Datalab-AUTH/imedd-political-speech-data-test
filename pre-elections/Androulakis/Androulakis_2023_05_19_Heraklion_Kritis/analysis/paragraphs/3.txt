What are those doing who want to abuse this historical and social legacy of the party founded by Eleftherios Venizelos and re-founded by Andreas Papandreou in 1974? Let us take the example of Neo-Nazism and Golden Dawn. Let us take this example. What they did for Golden Dawn. One looked at the polls. Mr Mitsotakis, while Golden Dawn was below 3%, it was useful for his self-reliance and did nothing for three years and in addition let Kasidiaris campaign from prison. What did Mr Tsipras do? What were his democratic reflexes?
