Friends, we owe it to young people to commit ourselves that the cost of living will fall. Your children, your grandchildren are leaving to study in Athens, in Thessaloniki. Other young people come here, but they cannot find houses, low-cost housing. Rents are going through the roof. In recent years we have had a huge rise in the cost of living. What are we doing? What the Socialists are doing in Portugal and Spain. Social housing for 150,000 young couples and students. No, we are not giving away houses, Mr Mitsotakis. We are giving houses with low rental costs, either from the recovery fund, which had the audacity to say that it was interested, and the Portuguese have put 26 000 newly built houses in the recovery fund, the Spanish have put 20 000 newly built houses in the recovery fund, and Mr Mitsotakis despises the younger generation, putting 70 houses in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki, but he is throwing ashes in your eyes with the EUR 150 youth pass.
