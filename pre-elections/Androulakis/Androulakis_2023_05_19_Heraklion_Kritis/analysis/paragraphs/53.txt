I pledge, here from Democratic Heraklion, I pledge here from Democratic Heraklion, that we will not disappoint any Greek woman or Greek man. The new era with a strong PASOK will again be an era of social justice and national dignity. Because PASOK was born to serve the people and the country. That is what we are, the people-born patriotic movement. Friends, remember historically we have always been on the opposite side, from easy, from patronage. We have made mistakes. Let's be honest with ourselves. We hurt the people sometimes. But we have a duty to make this experience a brave change. PASOK has suffered and learned.
