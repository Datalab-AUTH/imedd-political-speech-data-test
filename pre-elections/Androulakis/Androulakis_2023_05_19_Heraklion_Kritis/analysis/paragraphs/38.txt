Friends, education is what the Greek people need. Dignity in public education too. The centre of gravity today is not the school, the high school and the lyceum, but the tutorials. We must put an end to this, because the cost to the Greek family is enormous. What are we saying? We establish the National Baccalaureate, as in other European countries, so that the centre of gravity for the youth is the public school and not the tutorial. And that way Tsipras and Mitsotakis won't be playing dice on the backs of young people about the base 10 and that your children's future won't be decided in one exam. There will be no family angst, no child suffering, but in the last 2 years of the national baccalaureate with multiple exams, the child will choose with dignity and cheapness how to create their dreams for a better life.
