Putting into the dustbin of history the discord, the toxicity offered by Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis at the expense of the public interest. However, friends, I would like to clarify to our political opponents here from Heraklion that there are no titles of ownership of the historical social legacy of the democratic party. This legacy and its continuators are those who fight every day for respect for human rights, for a strong rule of law, for the separation of powers.
