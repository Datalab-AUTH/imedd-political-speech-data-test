Young people today want to study. PASOK is here. We are here again in Liberty Square. In the square of the Democratic Games, in the square of the proud Cretan people who gave birth to PASOK. Here we send a message of victory again to all of Greece because Crete will once again become our castle. Crete will be green again. This is what we must achieve on Sunday 21 May.
