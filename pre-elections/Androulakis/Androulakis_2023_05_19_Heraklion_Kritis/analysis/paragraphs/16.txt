People do not forget what the Right means. But we have a duty to confront every kind of maintenance, the maintenance that makes Greece unable to stand on its own feet in European normality, the maintenance that makes hundreds of thousands of Greek children go abroad, the maintenance that continues the client state and the buffet. We have a duty to build a state of transparency and meritocracy. That is why, and here from Heraklion, I pledge that if we are the government, all the positions of hospital administrators, all the positions of organizations that were appointed by party children of New Democracy, Syriza or ours in the past will be stopped and with an open international competition, the best Greeks will come to serve the public interest, to respect your taxes and not to be the signatures on the office of the Prime Minister of the day.
