Friends and friends, the Greek mother, the Greek family, the mother. We have a duty to deactivate the huge national demographic bomb. Demography is a top priority for a patriotic movement such as PASOK. That is why we support the family and especially young mothers in their multiple roles. No child, I pledge here from Heraklion, no Greek child will be left out of nurseries and creative activity centres. Let us support the Greek family. Also increase the maternity allowance for freelance women so that they can stay at home with their child and not have to run to open their office before they even give birth. And of course, lower taxes on families with children.
