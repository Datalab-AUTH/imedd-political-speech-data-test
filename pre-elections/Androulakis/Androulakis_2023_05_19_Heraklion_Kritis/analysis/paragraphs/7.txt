Justice. Who respected justice? My friends, Mr Tsipras was acquitted by the Special Court, a member of Syriza, and he said that justice works very well. Another member of Syriza, his closest associate, was convicted 13-0, justice is bad. Mr Mitsotakis, we are catching him with a goat on his back. With the illegal wiretaps that I am also a victim of and the Armed Forces Authority, he is absolutely covering for his nephew. So what justice? When has justice ever been respected? We discover the interceptions, for months I was bombarded by the New Republic social media that I was an agent of foreign powers. What the right did in the post-civil war state at the expense of the left. And when after a few hours I went to justice, instead of the Left really and genuinely supporting our effort, they started to instrumentalize the case by telling the people "don't trust him, he's taken".
