They remain unrepentant and they must pay for it at the ballot box on Sunday. They are two unrepentant power systems that in the face of their goal of capturing the chair, put the public interest and your real concerns in the back room. It is therefore our duty to defeat these two systems by the popular verdict on 21 May. Friends. I am talking about consultation, I am not talking about power bargaining. There are no power bargains, Mr Tsipras, Mr Mitsotakis. The government will be determined by the people on 21 May and not by the oligarchs in dark rooms, as you have learned in the past.
