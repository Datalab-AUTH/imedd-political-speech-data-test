From this proud place, we send a message to Mr.Tsipras that when he invites the excrement of the apologists of the junta, he must also take responsibility. Why is he inviting me to progressive fronts? Who are the progressives? Who are the anti-rightists? Those who were with Mr. Kamenos and now have half of Kamenos' party on their ballots or those who have Antonaros, the right hand of Karamanlis, the Karamanlis of bankruptcy, whom Mr. Tsipras cheered from Serres the day before yesterday. But come on, come on, let's accept that for electoral reasons he is coddling the Karamanian right. But the progressive world, the democratic world, does not accept that he should caress the extreme right-wing neo-Nazis and that Barbarousis should come out and tell the Golden Dawn MP that he will vote for Syriza. It is a disgrace and I invite every leftist, every democrat, every progressive to the great embrace of the democratic party, to the real home, PASOK, our movement. But now. But now what he said in the last few hours proves why Mr. Tsipras in Parliament did not vote for the amendment that prohibits the killers of Fyssa, the killers of immigrants, from participating in the political system. You know, but that's not all.
