So who expresses the new political ethos? Shall we go back to the tragedy of Tempe? What happened in Tempe? The Independent Transparency Authority in October '21 had a conclusion that said who was responsible from '14 to '21 between governments and SYRIZA and New Democracy, that while Europe gave 55 million euros for telecommunications, there was no telecommunications and 57 of our fellow citizens died unjustly. What happened to this conclusion? Minister Karamanlis locked it away in his drawer. And this gentleman is today also on the ballot papers of the New Democracy. But why has he stopped? Why has SYRIZA stopped talking about this finding? Because it also reveals its own responsibilities, which gave seven extensions to the project in favour of the contractor company so that it would never be implemented.
