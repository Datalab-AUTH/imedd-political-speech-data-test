Friends and friends. Private debt. We held an event next door a few months ago and I heard the agony of the Heraklion Union, as I hear all over Greece, the agony of 80 thousand families with Swiss francs and hundreds of thousands of Greeks whom Mr Tsipras deceived by saying from '12 to '15 don't pay, don't pay, no house in the hands of a banker. And he brought electronic auctions and sold billions of red loans to blackmail today the Heraklion Union, our farmers, our livestock farmers, the crows of the funds. That was Mr Tsipras' Left.
