Friends. But let's see why PASOK? Why PASOK. It made mistakes, but what it did for the country is what it built. It is the contribution of the years of post-independence of this party to the great projects of the NHS, public education, independent authorities, the AÎ£EP and of course Diavgeia, so that the Greek people can see where their taxes go and corruption can be reduced. So now, just before the national elections. We are signing a new contract of honour with all Greeks and especially with the young and powerful PASOK.
