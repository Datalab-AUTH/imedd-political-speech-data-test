What did Mr Mitsotakis do? Yesterday Golden Dawn was condemned. Yesterday the murderers of Fyssa and the immigrants went to prison. Years have passed, I think. And what did he do during these years? Do you know what he did? He was looking at the polls. Mr Mitsotakis was saying. Kasidiaris has under 3%. It's fine for him to come down because the bar of self-reliance is falling more. He saw in the last few months that Kasidiaris has been rising, he says, "Oh, self-reliance is getting harder, they're getting into parliament. The law against Golden Dawn is the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis. But what is the Left of Mr Tsipras, what? I really want you to ask yourself if there is another left-wing party, in Europe, with the attitude that Mr Varoufakis' Mera 25 and Mr Tsipras' Syriza have towards the Nazis. One of whom even said what he said today? It would be better if they did not exist, but since they do. We cannot ban them from standing in the elections, and Mr Tsipras did not pass the law that should have been there to prevent Golden Dawn from descending. And I ask. What do they have to say? To the families of the victims. But isn't it just ideology? They are criminals, they are murderers who are in prison. Is it possible to have parties that fish in the murky waters of neo-Nazism, of murderers, and not have a clear stance on these phenomena? So that is why we do not receive lessons in progress, consistency and credibility from the left-wing chanting right-wing.
