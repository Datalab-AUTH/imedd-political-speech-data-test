Friends. May 21 we are fighting a very big fight. A fight that we call on every citizen to make a decision for change. Many of you believe that it is weak, impossible to make again a strong welfare state like the one of the 80s and 90s with a strong NHS with a strong public education. Even more people believe that it is impossible to stop the bureaucracy and the client state. Thousands of young people believe that fair development is impossible and that it is always a game of growth for the few. For the powerful. So give me, on 21 May, the power to make the impossible possible together with all of you, together with all the progressive, democratic people of the country. So I call on the people not to make a decision again. Of the same but to give us the hope and the strength to build a modern country, a normal European country, not a country of lost opportunities.
