Friends, I cannot, here from Ilia, not refer to the agricultural issues of the whole country. We have said from Trikala that we must support agricultural production. For us, a sustainable development model is not to turn the whole of Greece into a vast hotel, but simply to strengthen tourism by interweaving the agricultural sector, agri-food, livestock farming and processing with all the hordes of tourists who come to Greece every year, otherwise only the entrepreneurs and the islands will benefit at the expense of the production of the rest of the country. What is our vision? A large part of these people to taste Greek products in Greece and then in the next few months to ask for them on the shelves of supermarkets in all the countries of the European Union and thus your products, the processed products to be internationally competitive, boosting exports and creating many good jobs throughout the Greek periphery so that the children of farmers stay here to produce wealth, to make families and finally to deal with the huge demographic issue of the country. That is a priority for us. So that is why we say.
