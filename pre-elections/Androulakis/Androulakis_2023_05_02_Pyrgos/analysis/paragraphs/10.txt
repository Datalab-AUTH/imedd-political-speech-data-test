Friends. But what is the alternative? Why, with all this, hasn't Mitsotakis already fallen? Why hasn't New Democracy already fallen? Because, quite simply, many citizens. They fear the return of Mr Tsipras. So that is why today and here from the Tower we say give us the power to put the two tragic protagonists of the last 8 years in the dustbin of history. And why don't people trust Mr. Tsipras and what he didn't make fake referendums in '15 to make the yes yes no yes in a few hours. Saying for 7 months that he negotiated the debt and not bringing a fair solution to the debt that could avoid closing the banks and losing billions of your taxes to support the system.
