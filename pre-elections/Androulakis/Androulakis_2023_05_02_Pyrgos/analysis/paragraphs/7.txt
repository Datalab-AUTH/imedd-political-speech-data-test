But is that not all? The banks what did Mr Mitsotakis do? Billions in excess profits for the banks allowed deposit rates with mortgage rates. To be the highest in differential in all of Europe, to the detriment of the customer consumer. And he said I can't do anything, I can't tax the excess profits. A few weeks ago the banks gave him a gift and for some borrowers they fixed the interest rate. The mortgage. So why didn't we do what the Spanish did? By enabling the banks and with political pressure to reduce the difference in interest rates and support consumers in the most difficult time of the energy and economic crisis. Simply because Mitsotakis does not have priority. The citizens. The many. Mr. Mitsotakis has only one priority, the chair, power and the support of the oligarchs who coddle him from the media.
