Every day more and more people are becoming averse to politics, especially the younger generations. Why should we vote in elections? Why participate in a game that offers no solutions? Here, then, is a glorious field of glory to rebuild a new relationship of trust with the Greek youth, with all Greeks, to prove that we are not all the same. We have nothing to do either with Mr Mitsotakis's New Democracy, which serves the domestic elite faithfully, or with Mr Tsipras's populism, which has betrayed the expectations of the Greek people by saying things. Which he himself did not believe, but then to take the blame off himself, he said they were delusions.
