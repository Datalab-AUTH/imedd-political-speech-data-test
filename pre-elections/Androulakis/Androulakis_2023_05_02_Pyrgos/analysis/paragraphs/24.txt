Friends. I want to dwell a little on our national issues. It is for us, this patriotic movement party, PASOK, a very critical position of our political opponents on national issues. And I also want here from Ilia. To make the Greek people remember. To stimulate the intelligence of the Greek people and make them remember. Which party is the one that, on the big national issues with Turkey and the Balkans, has had stable and reliable positions for decades? And which parties are the ones that said other things before the elections, but then made compromises wishful thinking afterwards? With a specific strategy, we brought Cyprus into the European Union in 2004, making the island fully secure against Turkey's challenges with the Cyprus problem unresolved. What did our political opponents do?  Mr Tsipras. He went to Germany last. And he saw Mr. Solts. I did not hear him say the word arms embargo on Turkey's provocations, but we heard him say about the so-called new Aegean Prespa agreement he has not yet made sense of the previous Prespa agreement. So he needs to explain to the Greek people who his interlocutor will be, because he says that if the situation with Erdogan changes and the others come in, that is, Mr Kilindzaroglu, we can do the Prespes Aegean agreement. But Mr Kilidzaroglu, Mr Tsipras. He has made stronger challenges to our islands than Mr Erdogan. So what is the plan of this agreement? Shall we tell it during the election so that the Greek people know it? What are the positions of all parties on these important issues that concern not one generation but many generations to come?
