And of course, the seismicity. The well-known seismicity was also coming here all over Greece, in '12, '13, '14, and it was saying you owe, don't pay. I'm coming to bring the seismicity. What was Mr. Tsipras's Seisachathy? Did you see any adjustment to your loans? Mr. Tsipras' Seisachthia was today billions of euros of red loans from cooperatives from farmers from farmers from farmers from small and medium enterprises have been handed over to the funds to the crows that blackmail the Greek production that blackmail the Greek people to the crows that in 2015 took the red loans with Mr. Tsipras' signature with his own law and he has the nerve to say but I was pressured by the Troika. But the PASOK government with George Papandreou as Prime Minister was also pressured by the Troika, but we did not sell the red loans to the funds. We brought universal protection to the first home of the Greek with the 2010 law that Mr Mitsotakis killed 3 years ago.
