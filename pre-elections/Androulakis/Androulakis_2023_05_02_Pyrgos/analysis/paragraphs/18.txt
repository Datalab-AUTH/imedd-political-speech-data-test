Friends to see Mr. Mitsotakis' disregard for this very serious issue of the cost of living in the Recovery Fund. When Portugal included 20,000 homes. Spain 11,000 homes; Italy also around 10,000. New Democracy included 100 houses, 70 in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. And today it says it will create a special ministry for social housing when the Europeans were giving the money for it, it was acting like Pontius Pilate, and now before the elections it is starting to talk about rabbits and stones again, when it had the time and the money and did nothing.
