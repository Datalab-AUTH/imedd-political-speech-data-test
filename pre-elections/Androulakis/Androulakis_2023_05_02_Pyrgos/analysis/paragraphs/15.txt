So that is why I want to send a message to the new generation here from Pyrgos in the prefecture of Elis. It is not an anti-systemic vote. It is a vote for the murderers of immigrants and Fyssa. It is not an anti-systemic vote, a vote for them. Who even today from the prisons praise Hitler who massacred the Greek people. That is not an antisystemic vote. An antisystemic vote is a vote for a party. One that has the courage to confront the economic establishment that is holding Greece back, tied back an antisystemic vote is a vote for a party that wants to confront the establishment, which does not want reforms that build a public administration with dignity, without corruption. That is the antisystemic vote and I really ask that they support our new effort because we are a party of antisystemic realism, not systemic mockery.
