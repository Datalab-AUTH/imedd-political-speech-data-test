Friends and friends. Private debt. It is a bomb on the foundations of society. The debts of the Greek people. We don't have a magic wand. But our proposals are clear. We are restoring the protection of the main house for indebted households, by updating the PASOK law of 2010. A similar regulation for the universal protection of agricultural property. We cannot allow the rural land to be left unoccupied. Protection of borrowers with Swiss Franc is 80,000 families throughout Greece, by limiting the borrower's liability to 1/3 of the interest rate increase and 2/3 will be charged to the bank. Substantial negotiation with the banks to take measures to eliminate and prevent interest rate increases, loans, weak households and of course reduce the banks' profit margin for consistent borrowers. Our priority is to regulate even the loans bought by the funds, the red loans, so that a second chance is given. To the citizens and to have redemptive solutions and not to be hostage to financial systems that are not interested in regulation. Because what do they want what they got 10 and 15% in value to sell 20 and 25% and get out of Greece? So we in Parliament have to legislate so that negotiations with the funds are done in a framework, as with the banks in the forefront and not with blackmail leading. Thousands of people to deadlock and tragedies.
