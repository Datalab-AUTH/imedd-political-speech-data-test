Friends. The energy issues are very important, but the institutional issues concerning farmers are also important. In addition to the introduction of the unconditional and tax-free status, subsidies, compensation and aid for farmers, we believe that we need to update the ELGA insurance regulation by extending coverage for disasters to livestock caused by climate change. The Ministry of Rural Development cannot pretend that it does not understand the damage caused by climate change every year. Our farmers and even when the figures say that this year. We will have one of the hottest summers ever in extreme weather. The whole process also for the common agricultural policy programmes must be completed within a year to stop bureaucracy with specific dates for applications, evaluation and payments.
