And of course the phenomena of corruption. Mr Mitsotakis that he is a government of the unqualified. Mr. Patsis was an aristocrat who bought the red loans of the Greek people in order to speculate. It was a matter of corruption. Or of a proper state? The issue of the eavesdropping parastate, where it was amply demonstrated that he was monitoring me, his ministers and the heads of the armed forces in a European state in 2023, and even instead of proceeding with the investigation of the case, he completely covered up his closest collaborator, his nephew, in which European country have we seen such a parastate operating today, exposing the country internationally? And to say that he is a worthy European politician and, a month ago, to ban his ministers from meeting the European institutions in Athens, exposing the country to the extent that Hungary and Poland are exposed, is a disgrace for a normal European country that respects the separation of powers and democracy.
