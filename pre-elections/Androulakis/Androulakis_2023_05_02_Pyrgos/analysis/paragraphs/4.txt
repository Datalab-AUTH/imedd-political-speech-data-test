So I want us to remember what our political opponents have offered. And why are we credible and they are credible? Not because no one can say that they did not know that we have all governed, both PASOK and New Democracy and Tsipras and Kammenos. We all know now what they did to the country and what they did not do. So let us look at what Mr Mitsotakis has done. He came to power in 19, saying that he would confront the institutional acrobatics and games of Mr Tsipras. What did we see? We saw him go through with the pandemic and instead of the country pouring money from the Recovery Fund, it's not our taxes, it's European taxpayers' taxes, money that came as subsidies to bear the 32 billion pandemic season. So instead of supporting the national health system, he left. To have a complete degradation with health workers struggling and nothing better than what we have experienced in previous years with very large health gaps and a very weak primary health care system.
