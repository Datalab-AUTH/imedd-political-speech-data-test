What else was there no corruption with his closest associate. Mitsotakis got ahead of it and covered it up. I hope in the next government. That I want us to be strong, to have a commission of inquiry that will take Mr Demetriades where he needs to go, without being able to invoke a supposedly confidentiality. The secrecy of the New Democracy parastate. Mr Tsipras did not get the chance because the government changed even though he changed the law on the responsibility of politicians so that Mr Pappas could be on the ballot papers. And his close and stable collaborator was convicted by the Special Court with 13-0. For the illegal rigging of the TV licenses. So what did he want? Mr. Pappas, Mr. Tsipras to redistribute the TV landscape to their friendly oligarchs and I ask you? Which party in the country would he have on his ballot? Someone who is convicted 13-0 by the Special Court for such a huge scandal. Imagine if it were us. What would we have heard from Mr. Tsipras?
