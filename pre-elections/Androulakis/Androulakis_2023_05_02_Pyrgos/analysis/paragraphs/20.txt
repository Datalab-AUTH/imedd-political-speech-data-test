Friends. The third point of convergence we propose is the national health system. George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos founded the National Health System. Our generation has a duty to regenerate the national health system. Therefore, we propose to support the Recovery Fund, not 2-4%, as Mr Mitsotakis is doing because 2 is the real funds, the other 2% is for the energy upgrade of buildings, but with 8 to 10% of the funds to go for health strong primary health care that will reach the citizen's home in every case, immediate staffing of the hospitals of the NHS with permanent medical staff is required, as well as an increase in salaries. The doctors and health workers should be brought into line with the doctors of the European Union, because otherwise we will continue to study them in Greek universities, but they will choose to go abroad, because their salaries are much higher than in Greece, of course. Establishing social economic incentives to stop understaffing in the periphery. Finally, it is our commitment, we have tabled an amendment in Parliament. We hope and as a government we hope to make it a law inclusion in the heavy and unhealthy of all health workers and not only. Straws as they heard in the earlier period of the pandemic.
