Friends. Thank you very much for your moving presence here in Pyrgos, which proves that the train of the democratic party is back on the tracks of change, hope and perspective for all Greeks. This party? Where our founder Andreas Papandreou came from many decades ago, the party that created the National Health System, the party. That brought social justice and national dignity to the country, that united the Greeks, that stopped discrimination based on political affiliations and economic status. Religion this party it is time to lift the country up again a country that now for many years, whether through the economic crisis, the pandemic, or the energy crisis, is constantly experiencing the decline of thousands of Greek children left abroad. Production, the cost of production has gone through the roof. Inequalities are escalating and of course. Disillusionment is taking root again.
