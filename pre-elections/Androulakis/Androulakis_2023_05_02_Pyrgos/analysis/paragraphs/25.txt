And of course, the issue of refugee migration is also very important. Mr Mitsotakis went to Evros. And he took pictures at the fence. I remember that when PASOK started this project. Mr., then Mr. Samaras was saying that this is a meme-centric diversionary game to change the agenda and now they are running around taking pictures. So we have clear positions, there are borders at sea and everywhere and we have a duty to guard the country's borders. The country is not a closed vineyard, but... We understand. The farmer, the stockbreeder, the processor. Who sees today in the trees of Ilia, Crete, Messinia, the fruit rotting because there are no workers damaged by the policies of Mr. Mitsotakis. So I will say, for us there is no black or white, there is only. the foreground. We want. The country's commitments to be honoured regarding the refugee issue. When it comes to migration, there are borders. The country must not relive 2015. The only winner was Erdogan, who blackmailed the whole of Europe and we paid for it, as did other European nations. But we need a coherent immigration policy. What do our hotels need? Our economy, Our peasantry and get a coherent immigration policy, as all European countries have done without populism and cheap communication games. This is exactly what I represent. I represent the anxiety of every Greek woman and every Greek man for Greece to become a normal European country and not to be a hostage to the elitism of Mr Mitsotakis. And the populism of Mr Tsipras. This is what the Greek people deserve, nothing less.
