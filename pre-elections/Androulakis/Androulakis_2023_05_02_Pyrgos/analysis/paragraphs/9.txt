We highlighted that in October 21 the independent Transparency Commission sent a document to the Ministry of Infrastructure. Which clearly told Mr. Karamanlis who are responsible from 2 successive governments, who are responsible for not implementing the Convention to have telecommunications and avoid the tragedy? And when we asked Mr. Karamanlis. What did you do with this document? His answer was not that I took it to the courts, as would be the case in any state that respects its citizens, but his answer was that I did not know of the existence of the document and this gentleman adorns the ballot papers of New Democracy with contempt for the intelligence of the Greek people.
