We have a duty to reduce the cost of production especially for agricultural inputs, animal feed, fuel by zeroing the excise tax on agricultural oil for the whole period of the energy crisis, with support to give priority to energy communities of farmers, municipalities of the region, farmers' cooperatives. Why? But is it possible that the whole of Europe is making a green transition, lowering production costs through energy and we stop using lignite as an intermediate? Gas as a fuel for production and not do what they are doing in Spain, Portugal and Germany. As a priority, farmers, livestock farmers, processors, manufacturers, craftsmen should have renewable energy parks so that they have stable costs for the next 10-15 years. So it is our commitment that throughout Greece the priority will be the democratisation of green energy production, with priority given to Greek production. To give low production costs and to strengthen our own products by making "Made in Greece" the country's flag for exports.
