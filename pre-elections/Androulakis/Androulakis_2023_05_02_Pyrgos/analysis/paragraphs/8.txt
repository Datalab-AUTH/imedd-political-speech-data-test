But. We also had the tragic issue of Tempe. Yes. One of your fellow men lost his life. What was the tragedy of Tempe? Timeless responsibilities? So they were taught to have a political ethos of spreading the blame so that nothing changes in the country, so that we live in groundhog day, so that everything is always the same. It's not timeless blame, it's just the way things are. Even the three-member committee appointed by Mr Mitsotakis to investigate the tragedy of Tempe, where 57 people lost their lives unjustly, ultimately said Mr Voridis and Mr Georgiades, who had the audacity to mock the citizens on the television channels that the transfer of the stationmaster was illegal. So who, Mr Mitsotakis, is it that made this illegal transfer, so that a man does not have the knowledge, the competence to be in this position? Who will be the protagonist behind the party buffoonery of New Democracy? But obviously if we had telecommuting we wouldn't have this tragedy. Why didn't we have telecommuting? Because quite simply. In 2014 we signed a contract our state. It was taken by a contractor. The contract was about 43 million euros, all European money. The contract reached 55 million euros. And with Mr. Tsipras took as Mr. Mitsotakis 7 transfers, the implementation of the project. As a result the project was never implemented. So when the European Union gives 55 million euros to preserve the safety of citizens on the railways? And you do nothing? Are you politically accountable? But there is something much worse.
