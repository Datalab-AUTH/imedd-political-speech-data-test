What else have we seen in terms of accuracy? But accuracy for all of us, not for the oligarchs. The PPC's tariffs. With billions of subsidies from the pockets of the Greek people, it supported the oligarchic energy producers and at the same time made them earn more in the energy crisis than in previous years. And we, of course, had tariffs that we thought were lower than those of the first few months, while in fact they were subsidised by the taxes of the Greek people. Controls on the market, what controls on the market? No controls on the market, few controls on the market, and even today there is enormous obscenity at the expense of the consumer.
