So here is a battle of truth and populism. That is why we all have a duty to speak clearly and straightforwardly just before the national elections. Mr Tsipras is entitled to put me in a dilemma, saying that PASOK will go with New Democracy. Mr Tsipras, we have no right-wing factor on our ballot papers, neither Karamanlis, nor Samaras, nor Mitsotakis; the New Democracy of bankruptcy is something you should look for on your ballot papers with the orphans of Mr Kammenos and Mr Antonaros. This party has a value-based attitude. This party has spoken clearly against Golden Dawn from the very beginning. It did not fish in murky waters and it is even touching that one of the people who spearheaded our campaign in our campaign since 2010 against the neo-Nazi phenomenon was a fellow citizen of yours. Paul Athanasopoulos, who sadly passed away a few weeks ago. A right-wing pacifist, a true democrat. So we. We fought against Golden Dawn all over Greece. We did not coddle the phenomenon of murderers.
