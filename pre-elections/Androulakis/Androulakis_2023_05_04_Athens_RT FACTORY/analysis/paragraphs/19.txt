Another issue that directly concerns the initiative taken by friends and comrades from abroad. In these elections? More than 400,000 young people from 17 to 21 have the right to vote. How will they come to the polls? Nobody knows. The disappointment is great. We aim to stimulate participation. We have a duty. We have a duty to confront. The perception that politics is a problem is buffoonery, it's undignified, but that's what he wants. The personal example the individual example of each of us from the President to the last member to show our culture. That we. We ask, we seek positive participation. The citizen, the young person. To come and discuss? Voting is power. And for change, but also for perspective. But if. We stay. In literary debates, without a programmatic stigma, we cannot be listened to, so what I ask you is to take a look at the PASOK program. It is a programme that was made with a great deal of effort. With large discussion tables, with people who have experience, with young people, with professionals, with farmers. It is a program that we can nuggets of it to be. For a lot of people. A lifeline for the future. A lifeline to believe in politics again and I really want from all of us in these 3 weeks left to fight for positive participation, to talk to our generation to your generation so that young people can come to. Engage in discussion and participate in the national elections of course.
