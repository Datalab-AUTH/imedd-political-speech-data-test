Enabling young people to open their own home. And I'm talking about the now familiar, which is the cornerstone of our programme, the social housing tank. We said it first, we believe in it and we will do it on the model of Portugal. 150,000 social housing units for young couples, students, weak Greeks, either with construction from the Recovery Fund or with tax incentives or reconstruction incentives, so that closed houses can be opened up, join the pool and rented at low cost. The New Republic. Wanting to respond. To this programmatic position. He made a program. I really want. To read what this program means this program is a program of new ownership. What we're saying is a low rent for 150,000 families so that not only 150,000 families but thousands of families benefit from competing at lower rents to de-escalate rents in all urban centres and not have a huge flow to short-term rentals undermining life. The cost of living in major urban centres at the expense of younger generations, especially the younger generations. I inform you that because of the increase. The cost per square foot. This program in essence is unworkable, it is again for the few who have strong economic ability. The society of inherited power, but that's what we want to overturn. We don't want it to have a perspective. Only he who has inheritance. We also want the person who did not find a legacy to have a perspective, because his parents may have had a difficult decade because of the economic crisis, so we have a different philosophy from New Democracy. We have the philosophy that does not make the new generation a citizen-customer through new property, but makes them citizens with dignity through the low cost of living that will apply to the whole new generation.
