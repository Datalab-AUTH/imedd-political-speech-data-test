So I believe that our generation has a very great debt to build a modern Greece, a modern European Greece, which will give many opportunities to young people. It will be an inclusive state, a state that is sensitive to the weak citizens and not a state that only sees. The polls, the upcoming polls. And not the future and the prospect. We have paid dearly for these parties that do not speak visionary, do not speak programmatically, but only know how to do well is to control the state apparatus and get on well with the domestic oligarchy. We have a duty and I have a duty to confront and we will confront together all the powerful vested interests that do not allow Greece to become a normal European state with many opportunities for all Greeks and not only for the powerful.
