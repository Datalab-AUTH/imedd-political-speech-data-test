We do not envision Greece. A huge hotel. We envision tourism, a locomotive that will pull other wagons of the Greek economy, such as livestock farming, such as the agricultural sector, such as manufacturing. There cannot be such a strain on the natural environment in Greece. In a few years we may feel like foreigners on our islands because of the strong real estate investments, which is Mr Mitsotakis' development. And we will not be able to set limits for respect for the environment, but for respect for man himself and the Greek citizen, the producer, everyone who wants to create in the context of a modern economy, of sustainable development.
