7.4% fall in real wages in 2022, third from the bottom of all European countries. We are in purchasing power. Of course. Even on the tax issue, the tax system in Greece is so unfair that the injustice is revealed if we see that 66%. Of the state's revenue comes from indirect taxes that mainly affect the poorest Greeks and the middle class. So then. Life is getting harder. Life is not getting better. Particularly if we put into our discussion that Europe has taken some steps, this is not 2009. It created the Recovery Fund gave the country 32 billion, there has been a big fiscal expansion. But it has been done in an unfair, unjust, unqualified way in an opaque manner, and as a result, education has not been supported either. Nor was health care. Nor the real green transition, nor low-cost digital convergence. And with greater speed, as has happened in other European countries. It continues to be the state even today. To be a spoilsport in the hands of the prime minister of the day. So that is why I say it again and I have said it many times today the first priority is for the state to be a guarantor of the public interest. This is the vision of every social democrat. This is our main objective in the next national elections, no more of the state being the prey of the citizens and friends of Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis and anyone who wants to remain Prime Minister at the expense of the state. All of us, our taxes and our future.
