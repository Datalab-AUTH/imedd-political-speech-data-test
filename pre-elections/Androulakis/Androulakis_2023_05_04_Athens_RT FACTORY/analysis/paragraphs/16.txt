Friends. Investing in networks I've said it many times and it ties in with what you asked. My hon. Friend without investment in networks from the recovery fund has been done by many European countries. We cannot have a green transition, we have a low-performing network for connectivity, the government and powerful oligarchic interests are exploiting the weaknesses of the network, and as a result only big parks are being built at the expense of a fair green transition.
