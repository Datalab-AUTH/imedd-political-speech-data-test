{"text_en": "Friends, thank you very much for your presence. Unfortunately, time is condensed and I have to do a lot of events together to catch up. But it is very hopeful that on every side of the country the climate has changed. The party has a dynamic presence, which with our daily struggle until May 21, I am confident will translate into a strong turnout that will create the conditions for a bold change in our country. Our vision is a strong Greece with dignity, with self-confidence, with social justice. This is the progressive vision and the agony of every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive citizen. We are always faithful to our timeless values. But always with modern convincing answers that take into account the new facts of the times and of course the new conditions created by the rapid developments taking place at the global level. We believe that Greece can walk with its head held high in the world and especially in the geopolitical space of Europe, to shape a framework of prosperity for all citizens. A new modern model that will serve the people and the country. But this requires overcoming harsh conservative management policies.\n\nThat is why we are proposing today a bold, a brave package of bold changes that will lead us safely and stably into the future, breaking the shackles that have been binding the country to the past for years. Times are changing and require adjustments. But we have a duty to do so with respect for our own timeless values, ideas and positions. We are fighting for quality employment, for full employment.\n\nFor social protection of the weakest middle class citizens. For equality, for the respect of individual rights and freedoms. We will do this together with society, always having the human being at the centre of our politics, we will not allow fear and insecurity about tomorrow to prevail, which create the ground for authoritarian policies, for policies of new inequalities.\n\nOur aim is to ensure strong sustainable growth that will enable the economy to stand on its feet regionally with competitiveness. Inward-looking by exploiting modern digital capabilities in all sectors of production and always respecting the environment. The benefits of this policy cannot be only for the few and the powerful; they must be spread to the whole of Greek society. That is why we are talking about a progressive tax system that ensures the necessary resources to reduce inequalities and fight poverty, development linked to the real needs of the people that guarantees a better life for the working man, so that he can live in a house he can afford access to housing. With dignity and low cost to get after several years of life a decent pension and feel secure in a health system that supports him in the hard times and not as we live today. A total decline. With policies that support the Greek family to be able to make ends meet, with social structures and a quality public education system for all the children of the Greek people. Our goal is to offer young people fair and equal opportunities to live, to develop in their own country, to get an education, to work with decent wages, to start a family.\n\nOur goal is to change the state to serve and emancipate the citizen by creating transparency, meritocracy and to operate with accountability, to be decentralized away from traditional clientelism, to restore the credibility of the political system by strengthening the institutions and by regaining the lost trust of the Greek people through the daily struggle for the separation of powers.\n\nOur goal is an open, non-discriminatory society and this is a historical legacy of PASOK. A society that will not live with the nightmare of racism and xenophobia.\n\nOur aim is to contribute to the courageous changes that the European Union needs, so that it does not get trapped again, as it did in 2009, in harsh austerity policies, which were imposed when powerful states put their own interests first and not the whole and the solidarity of all European peoples. That is why my proposal at the last Council was also to create a strong new European economic sovereignty fund, with additional funding to support the productive base, particularly in the countries of the South that have a traditional problem of low competitiveness, so that we can both contain the production that has left for third countries, especially China, but also other peripheral countries, and at the same time create strong jobs that will create a framework of low unemployment for young people in the South.\n\nFriends and friends. Today we present a section which has 12 important political initiatives. They are the 12 priorities of our programme. These are the priorities we will go forward with. With honesty and before the national elections, but even more so by breaking the established perceptions, we say and do other things just after the national elections, because the dominant feature of our policy is to build a new relationship of trust with the Greek people, especially with the new generation that was shaken both by Mr. Tsipras' Syriza and Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. That is why I am talking about programmatic convergences that we will seek in the formation of a possible government if we have a strong presence in the next Parliament. This government, our participation in a government guarantees these changes to ensure that the driver is the public interest, the interest of the citizens, of many citizens, and not the preservation of the privileges of the domestic elite and vested interests. When it is not reduced to a meaningless and odious sharing of chairs, to its own children and I am talking about the familiar mindsets that settle the various politicians. Immediately after every national election. Personally, with this presence, I am not entering into a game of benefit competition, as we have seen in the last week between Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis. This game is unfortunately inexpensive for them, but very expensive for the Greek people, as has been seen in the years of the economic crisis, when New Democracy handed us a bankrupt economy with huge external deficits. But that was not all that happened before the financial crisis. It is also the unrepentant attitude of these parties after the financial crisis. After the self-realization of the magnitude of the problem. Zapia, the Thessaloniki programmes and the conscious mockery that was dubbed an illusion to wash away the responsibilities of extreme populism. We are therefore building today the alliance, the social alliance for the brave new change with the creative forces of the country, with healthy entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers who want to stand on their feet with their heads held high, producers, livestock farmers, away from state-sponsored logic, interconnectedness and corruption, with citizens who want a state that provides stability, security and access to quality goods. For all citizens with those who are currently called upon to negotiate extortionately by the funds, without criteria and without rules. We owe it to all these people to provide redemptive solutions and a second chance, dignity for their lives. With those who need the support of a modern and effective welfare state that leads to empowerment, inclusion and not dependency. From temporary allowances that can or try to replace services that simply never happens, because there is not enough money in the allowance policy to replace services that exist in other European states in strong social models. We call on young people who want to break the hostage of clientelism and crony governments. We owe it to them to guarantee that their fear of living worse than their parents who live worse than their parents will be a bad past. They are our allies, they are the ones we are referring to, they are the ones we want to express, and they are the ones I call on to give us a strong mandate with a change resolution on May 21. These are the people who want to stand by us, who we will always stand by and who we aspire to never let down.\n\nFriends in the programmatic framework now. The first priority is a modern state with transparency, meritocracy, accountability and decentralisation. What does this mean? No decision is legitimate without publication on Transparency. No more direct commissions, in which Mr Mitsotakis is a champion. Evaluation of public officials and services everywhere and of course evaluation not by the party-appointed, fair, objective and not partisan evaluation. Drastic, of course, limitation of the number of post-employees in the ministries. Mr Mitsotakis was saying, Mr Tsipras had 2,800 and denounced him, and now it has reached over 3,500 and it is Friday today. No recruitment in the public sector outside the APSEP. The selection of senior management and this is a commitment that I repeat every day. Every public institution, governors, boards of directors, hospitals, all with an open international competition with a five-year term, so that we break the partisan cycle of elections that creates turmoil in the state and of course with commensurate financial rewards so that there is a strong incentive and people with very high scientific training come in. Decentralization with boldness, transfer of all executive powers and corresponding resources to the local government. We made the big reforms in local government, with both the left and the right against us. We have a duty to continue and make Greece a normal European country at the level of self-government, emulating the practices of countries that have a very long history in these institutions. And of course, digital change in the state for the service of the citizen, but also for the accountability of the administration, evaluation of services by citizens through digital applications.\n\nA modern state must also effectively protect human rights. We did not imagine a few years ago that this issue would be so high on our priorities. We thought that the country after the years of post-independence had overcome these evils, these incredible and unbelievable distortions. In the end we were wrong, which is why we are proposing to upgrade the role of independent authorities to monitor and submit rules both to the state and to the markets. We created the independent authorities. We still support them today, and it is really outside the European framework the unethical attacks that are being made both by Mr Mitsotakis's system and against Mr Tsipras's system in the past on people who are fighting to keep Greece anchored in European values, and this shows that they are not politicians who really believe in these values, they are just ready to instrumentalise everything just for power, just for the chair. And that is one reason why this party will be the democratic party throughout time. I want to tell you that this is why I am committed to repealing the provisions of the New Democracy Act on the issues of the wiretapping cover-up. A substantive role in the DPA decisions on legal intercepts. Commission of Inquiry without the abuse of secrecy. And of course, a law that allows victims to be informed and not over a three-year period, so that the person who has committed the crime can be in civil protection for an extended period of time. Strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and it is sad that even today in the latest reports of the European Commission and the European institutions, this thing is put as a priority for Greece. We have a duty to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. That is why we say that the selection of its supreme leadership must be made by Parliament with an increased majority.\n\nFriends, we want an open, non-discriminatory society, as I said before, on the basis of race, gender, religion and sexual orientation. I want older people to remember that it was our party that made the brave institutional changes in the 1980s, showing the European way of these great social reforms. We have a duty to continue them in the standards of the European framework.\n\nWork. Work with rules and dignity. The minimum wage will be set by the social partners through a national general collective agreement. Immediate thawing of three-year contracts and universal compulsory application of sectoral agreements, abolition of the provisions of the laws of the New Democracy that remove labour rights on working hours and protection from illegal dismissals or weaken the control mechanisms of the state. The new forms of work, which are now too numerous in modern times, must be regulated with rules for safety and the worker, presumption of paid employment for workers on platforms and distribution of goods. A new pay scale for civil servants with increases in grades to cover inflation losses and the creation of a merit-based system to reward the effort of civil servants.\n\nOur main priority, both historically and today, is the regeneration of the national health system. What does this mean? Increasing the funding of the NHS to the European average and strengthening its infrastructure with 8 to 10% of the resources of the Recovery Fund. Today New Democracy is essentially giving 2%. It reaches 4% because the energy upgrade of buildings is added up. You know it is unthinkable, when the Greek people, after many years of the economic adventure of new inequality, impoverishment, are third in private spending in the entire European Union, having also salaries - we are only surpassed by Bulgaria and Lithuania - Europe is making a fund specifically for the pandemic. And this fund is barely used. For this huge issue that concerns every Greek and especially the most vulnerable Greeks. So what are we saying about this? Repeal of Article 10 of the recent law of the New Democracy, which undermines the public character of the NHS, a strong and unified system of primary health care under public supervision with health centres in every municipality and integrated family medicine services everywhere. New modern hospitals which, as I said earlier, will have meritocratic selected administrations, utilisation of digital capabilities for full-day operation, especially in the interventional and surgical sectors. It is not possible in 2023 that we will not have followed these new scientific methods, which are improving health across Europe, and of course, we have a debt for a new health map. But this new health map will not be in political or politicised terms, it will be an objective new health map with hospital care for densely populated areas, the most important and pharaonic example being East Attica. But also in the rest of Greece based on population, based on the need of the summer which is still growing, the population due to tourism and the ageing of the population, we have to create this new objective health map. Create innovative care units outside hospitals for chronic diseases and day care, strengthen public rehabilitation centres and create new ones and fill all the real gaps in the NHS with permanent recruitment and transparent procedures, increase salaries at least at the level of the average of the European Union to attract highly qualified staff, but also to stop young health workers leaving abroad, which every day creates a huge issue for the future of the national system. Our commitment is to include all health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category. This was discussed, we had tabled an amendment in Parliament, but it was not passed by the government, a radical overhaul of the system for obtaining a specialty and an increase in the salaries of specialists. There must also be incentives for specialties that have been eliminated from the NHS, resulting in hundreds of surgeries being constantly postponed, fully staffed hospitals, health centres on our islands. It is a huge problem, as we have seen with a recent example in Serifos. Financial incentives. Covering housing costs, especially in areas with strong tourism, subsidies for attracting scientific potential to the region, support and increase of mental health structures, a huge deficit in our country compared to the European average and their integration into the primary care system, free medicines for vulnerable groups, low pensioners and the unemployed. No one alone, on the margins. This is a clear message from the democratic party. An increase in the social solidarity allowance, universal care services for children, the elderly, the homeless, single-parent families. Disability mainstreaming in all state policies and, of course, disability benefits should follow increases in the minimum wage.\n\nFriends. The second vital system for every social democrat, for every socialist, is education. These days, the shade war between Syriza and New Democracy has been reopened. University police, Article 16, admission for all without exams. Let us discuss and talk about the essence of the problem of education in Greece. So we are talking very specifically about this new modern model of public education, which has no rivalry with the private sector, but has a duty to support the public sector so that every Greek child has equal opportunities to stand on his or her own two feet. If the young generation does not stand on its own two feet, our country will never stand on its own two feet, and this is the message for the great reform that we owe to public education in our country. Remedial teaching programmes to close learning gaps and address inequalities. Utilisation of digital potential, a computer for every pupil and every teacher and an interactive computer board in every classroom, implementation of European quality indicators and opening up the school to environmental education, art and, of course, health education, where we are also lagging far behind, with the result that there is a huge issue of prevention and a culture of health in the country. Support for all-day kindergarten and primary school with a reformed educational programme, certification of foreign language and computer up to the third grade, upgrading of vocational education and lifelong learning, registration of professions and definition of professional rights. All-round support for special education and its structures, so that we finally have the real school of inclusion, a safe school environment and psychological and social support services to deal with the phenomena of violence that have escalated in our schools. I heard the Minister of Education in an interview, I think it was the other day, complain that we have about 3,000 psychologists and social workers, but she did not say how many schools we have, which is almost 23-24,000. Friends. Safe introduction of the national baccalaureate. It is very critical to the future of education. We are not saying abolish the exams. Students will hear that elsewhere. Because all over the world there are exams too. The question is what exams are there? We aspire that a person's future should not be judged on an exam. That is why we are talking about introducing the national baccalaureate. There will be exams in the last 2 years of study. This is also the case in Germany and France and other countries, but not in a single examination to decide your future. With all that this implies. So what are we talking about? The aim is to give content back to education, to public education, not to make secondary school and high school a parergroup. And, of course, through this new policy, to reduce the burden that every family has to bear from the school fees. So, through the national baccalaureate, we are making secondary school and high school the focus of this process again, so that young people can reach university. Outward-looking universities with links to production, local development, with research funding at the European Union average and innovation and, of course, meritocracy in academic development. We know the chronic pathologies that the Greek university has in the issues of internal meritocracy, upgrading and financial support for teachers at all levels of education and evaluation of educational work and its contributors.\n\nFriends. Our main programmatic objective is decent pensions for pensioners. That is why we are talking about a new ESAS that will affect 350,000 low-income pensioners. Change the SYRIZA and New Democracy laws and strengthen the contributory nature of pensions, abolish the personal differential from 1/01/2024 and promote occupational funds.\n\nAnother element of our policy. It is social justice as far as private debt is concerned. The main objective of our programme is to give a second chance to the Greeks who have struggled fairly, objectively, but who have not endured, and we propose redemptive solutions. We do not want them to be held hostage by the funds, of course, and by the government of the day, which is unable to legislate. So that is why we are calling for the reinstatement of the protection of the first home under Law 3869 of 2010. Of course with updated criteria and objective criteria in relation to how much they have paid off their loan. The price of the house and other criteria that will protect the first home of every vulnerable Greek 120 instalments for the arrangements of debts to tax authorities and social security funds and of course a 30% haircut for those who are punctual. Rules of operation for funds: lower instalments, fixed interest rates and viable arrangements for borrowers and, of course, universal protection for agricultural land, especially when millions of euros of red loans from cooperatives have gone to funds, which do not want any arrangements. They want sudden death and quick profit. It is our duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy, which has been led by Mr Tsipras' alleged Stisakhtia and Mr Mitsotakis' ineptitude. A solution for borrowers with a Swiss franc clause. We are the only ones who have engaged very substantially with legislative initiatives for these 80 000 families. What are we saying? Fair distribution of exchange rate risk. One third will be borne by the borrower and two thirds by the banking institutions that made these loans.\n\nAnother point of our programme, of our priorities, is the major objective of tackling the national demographic issue. For us, demography is a huge issue. It is this issue that undermines society, the economy, the welfare state, every aspect of our country's life. So we have to put the younger generation at the forefront, without the younger generation at the centre of our policies, we cannot address the demographic. That's why we have announced, we were the first to put it in the public debate, the creation of a pool of 150,000 social housing units that will be either built from resources - new resources from the Recovery Fund, something that other countries have tried to do. Or by providing incentives, tax incentives or incentives, to reconstruct old houses to owners, so that they can put them into the social pool those houses are not given for purchase with low-interest loans, as Mr Mitsotakis is doing. We are not building a citizen-customer relationship with new ownership. We are practicing a time-resistant policy. What does that mean? They will be given at a very low rent, with social criteria, so that not only 150,000 families will benefit, but also thousands of families in the wider areas, and through competition we will help to de-escalate the already increased rents in homes that will not have been included in the programme, and this is what examples from other countries show. So with our policy, we will not only support 150,000 families, but also hundreds of thousands of other families. It is a solid policy that 150,000 is a stepping stone. We aspire to start from there to go to the models and levels of countries such as Portugal, Spain, Austria, Germany. And this is particularly important if we take a walk around the region where this event is taking place. Here, rents used to be very, very low. And today, all over the centre of Athens, rents because of short-term rentals, the lack of rules on the part of the state, compared to initiatives taken by other municipalities and other countries in Southern Europe, are prohibitive for a student who wants to study in Athens, for a person who wants to start his life by living in the city centre.\n\nFriends. Another element of support for the new generation. Recruitment of 50,000 young unemployed people in the private sector with a four-year programme to subsidise employer contributions in full-time jobs. We subsidise work and do not support policies that increase unemployment. Tax incentives for young people who start business and professional activities. Construction of new quality halls of residence, restoration of the tax credit for children studying away from home. No child out of nurseries or creative activity centres. We owe it to the Greek mother to be a universal policy. Granting an additional monthly allowance of \u20ac200 for each new child born up to the age of 3, based on income criteria.\n\nAnother point of our programme. Tax system. As Social Democrats we serve the policy of progressive taxation, fair, progressive taxation. Our priorities now are to reduce taxes on labour, to help develop good jobs. Cutting VAT on basic foodstuffs. And of course, as far as the energy and economic crisis is concerned. Substantial market controls to crack down on obscenity. We are an immature market, it is too easy to speculate on the internal market, prices rise too fast and deflate too slowly because the market does not work capping the retail price of energy and of course reducing by 50% the unacceptably high tax-free threshold for parental benefits. And I say this because don't imagine 5% will make 4.8 million 2,400. What we are saying is that the limit of 800,000 should become 400,000 for the weak and middle class without the proliferation of the creative thinking of the New Democracy government that baptized social justice the tax-free parental benefit up to 4.8 million euros. This is not for the vulnerable and the middle class. This is only for the elites that Mr Mitsotakis's New Democracy faithfully serves, and let us put an end to the contempt for the public interest. Friends, a gradual, progressive increase in the tax rate on distributed dividends, which is one of the lowest in the European Union, and of course, extraordinary taxation of the excess profits of banks and large companies in monopoly sectors of the economy. It is something that other countries did when they saw deposit rates have the biggest gap with mortgage rates. And when we were saying it a year ago we were populists, but when the banks were giving Mr Mitsotakis' election gift for a few borrowers, it was a good policy. Unfortunately, it seems that powerful financial interests very much want this government to stay as it is for one reason only, because it puts no obstacles in the way of their incredible increase in financial power.\n\nFriends, production. There cannot be a strong welfare state without strong production. You cannot have a welfare state of a central European country, but your production is weak, weak, uncompetitive. So we as social democrats have as our priority sustainable development, a resilient Greece, a productive Greece, so our priority is that 'Made in Greece' is a message to strengthen domestic production at every level. Primary sector, agri-food, manufacturing, extroversion, 'Made in Greece' everywhere. How will this be done? We cannot measure tourism only in terms of visitors. We have to set other criteria. It is one thing to have 10 million people come and another to make 20 billion. It is another thing to come 20 million and make 20 billion. It is another thing to go to 30 million and the country makes twice as much in its GDP. Are we measuring the added value of the current Greek tourism model? We do not aspire for Greece to become a giant hotel. We have other ambitions. And what are they? Quality tourism with measurable results where we will know every year what percentage of travellers consumed domestic products and how these products in the following months when they went to their countries are on the shelves of the European Union or third countries from Arabia to America. Why did the Portuguese do it because the Spaniards do it by imitating the Italians and the Portuguese by imitating the Spaniards? So we cannot imitate something that is healthy that respects the environment that respects man. Do we have to live after 10 years, being strangers on our islands? No, we disagree with this perverse model of development. So we want all this to be a package of a visionary policy that respects the Greek citizen, that respects the environment, that respects the country.\n\nSo that's why we are proposing a national strategic development plan with a change in the priorities of the Recovery Fund to support domestic production with the creation of new jobs, regional development with the interconnection of tourism, as we said, with all sectors of the Greek economy. Three-year exemption from capital gains tax for new schemes resulting from partnerships and networking of SMEs, special lines of funding from the Recovery Fund for SME investment in innovation, energy adaptation, digital transformation, creation of development centres in the regions to provide technical assistance in design, standardisation, development of new products and their distribution networks. And of course, funding from the NSRF for the relocation of SMEs to organised craft parks to finally put a stop to this incredible distortion that is happening to businesses across Greece. Connection, and that is another matter, but very important for the economy.\n\nWe cannot just be consumers of arms programmes. We must also become producers of armaments programmes. And indeed, as a NATO country, when these weapons are sold to third countries, they also have very great economic benefits for the domestic economy. That is why we say linking arms programmes with support for our defence and shipbuilding economy. Nothing will happen without the country's co-production, and we have a duty to take initiatives to revise Community directives that put obstacles in the way of such a new policy that will put Greece at the forefront of the map of co-producers. Restoring national control of the superfund and transforming it into a fund for the exploitation of public assets.\n\nFriends. Another point. Protection of the environment. A modern party cannot be silent about the environment and people when climate change is at a gallop. It is likely that the coming summer will be the hottest summer of our generation. So we must speak ahead of our time, it is not the first time. I remember many years PASOK had a comprehensive policy the environment and you remember very well how the right-wing conservationists dealt with this policy? We were confronted by New Democracy in 2007 on the issue of green growth, just as Trump confronted the Democrats in the United States of America in 2020. We must not forget that. We must not forget that when we spoke ahead of our time, some people were playing Pontius Pilate serving powerful economic interests, but it is not just them. Europe has a well-developed plan to decarbonise fossil fuels. Is that what the left has done in Greece? Did it serve fossil fuel decarbonisation? From lignite maybe, but by putting natural gas as a transitional fuel at such a level that the country was more vulnerable than any other country in the South to the energy crisis and even Mr Tsipras yesterday had the nerve to say the following and the agreements that only he has signed in 2019 for fossil resources in Greece will be in force. In other words, he has also linked us by making us deeply dependent on imported natural gas and he himself is now trying to undermine any attempt to make us independent. Obviously we have our first priority on renewables, but for that to happen it has to be done gradually, not by putting foreign gas as a transitional fuel. But having our own natural gas, otherwise we have to change the whole geostrategic concept of the country for impending turbulence that will make us vulnerable to Turkey and other third countries. So we are talking about a very complex debate which, as I understand it, both our two political opponents are unable to have because their priority is not the just green transition, the democratisation of energy production, the tackling of energy inequalities and energy poverty, but the service of the powerful power producers, as has been proven by the huge subsidy policies with billions from the pockets of the Greek people. That is why our priority is access for all citizens and local authorities to renewable energy production as a priority. This is energy democracy. Only in this way can we wean ourselves off fossil fuels and natural gas. Subsidies for rooftop photovoltaic systems for domestic consumers, with priority for the poorest Greeks, investments in energy distribution and storage networks. Italy used the Recovery Fund to make a plant where it will create battery cogeneration is this, PPPs, private and public sector. You can't do a green transition without having a storage power. We don't even discuss these such serious issues. Fair transition in the western regions. If we look at the economic figures it is really desperate for Western Macedonia and for Megalopolis. Completion, excuse me, implementation of the green European agreement to achieve climate neutrality, completion of forest maps and forest inventory, strengthening of organic agricultural production, upgrading of recycling structures. Recycling at the average recycling cost of the European Union and not recycling, special recycling for Greece, where we pay several times more per tonne than other countries in the European Union. The country, as we are well aware, will be faced with rapid weather events. This is the consequences of climate change.\n\nThat is why I have served as an MEP and I aspire to do so as a government, to create a modern national civil protection mechanism, where the fire brigade will be the main arm of this effort with permanent jobs and with internal meritocracy in the fire brigade and always with reinforcement, with modern aerial means. We have already taken initiatives at European level for the new Canadian line. We will have them in our hands in a few years. And always with modernised civil protection plans that will also have the understanding of other countries that are ahead in modern civil protection methods. Finally, protection of water resources with new infrastructure and networks. It is obvious, I do not need to say it, but I have to say it so that it is not considered that I have forgotten, no discussion about the privatisation of water in our country.\n\nI have tired you of the last point of our programme, but from the very beginning when I was elected president, what we are told is that we have no seats. The truth is that we are never asked about seats. We are asked about other questions, we are not asked about positions, so I am going to get my grudge out on you. I apologize. We're tired of Dimitri and the guys going on the air and our candidates for Congress going on and on about the toxicity and divisiveness. And I really want to ask you in these few remaining days to bring out a different political ethos and a different political style. It is a question of educating ourselves against the digital parasite, against the devaluation of public debate.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't help but talk about the farmers because, as our well-known spotlight used to say in the past, blood is not water. Support for primary production and its people, measures to reduce the purchase costs of agricultural feed and fuel inputs, zero excise duty on agricultural oil - not for ever, of course - for the months of the energy crisis, that is, while this adventure is going on, support for energy communities, what I said earlier was a priority, farmers, livestock farmers, cooperatives, processors, so that they have stable production costs and central planning of production costs for the next 15 years and, of course, priority for organic farming, which is a priority. It is a big issue to create a resilient system for our water with a big land reclamation plan because I am afraid looking at the map, the drainage map of the country, that like we were talking about energy last year, if we don't do this big plan to support our farmers in relation to water and irrigation, we will be talking about water in the next few years like we were talking about energy costs this year. So that is why for us it is very important for the resilience of production to have a very big such planning throughout Greece. Of course, this also has to do with the culture of the producer that the Ministry of Rural Development has to contribute to and for the times of irrigation and the way for each product individually. These are models that other countries have. We unfortunately, the Ministry of Rural Development does not want and its current structure cannot play such a role. We must support this ministry. I remember, and I say this, an Italian Minister for Rural Development was telling me that Greece cannot fail to move in this direction, that it will be the first country in Europe to face such a big issue together with Cyprus on issues relating to water resources. Now, the introduction of tax-free and unconfiscated subsidies, compensation and aid for farmers and stockbreeders. Updating the ELGA regulation to cover disasters caused by climate change. The Ministry pretends not to know what climate change means in this matter of compensation. Accelerate investments from the new common agricultural policy programmes, abolish the runner-up beneficiary policy through proper resource planning, provide for decent working and housing conditions for foreign farm workers. This is a huge issue that concerns the entire Greek region. This year, the severe shortage of farm workers has caused too many people to see the fruit rotting on the trees. Very important extension issue, increase the Recovery Fund resources allocated to green and digital transformation of agricultural production and restructuring of low-yielding crops. Finally, creation of post high school agricultural schools for modern education of farmers. Incentives to employ young people in the primary sector and reduce their taxes so that they can be competitive and of course with the programme we had started in 2010 there should be free allocation of public land to have a policy of support for young farmers.\n\nFriends. I have finished the first chapter of our programme, I want to move on to the second. Well, I want to thank you very much for your patience. I hope that everything we have said will be a Gospel. This Gospel is the Gospel of the social democratic government that I aspire to have for Greece to become a normal European country. This is what we will negotiate if the Greeks honour us. All these will be the priorities of the negotiations of a strong government that will aim for the state to embrace the citizens' anxieties and not for the state to be hostage to the elitism of Mr Mitsotakis, the populism of Mr Tsipras and a common mentality, the spoils of power of their cronies. With us Demetrias, Pappas and party cronies who consider all that we say out of place in the face of chairs, power and interconnectedness, we will be an obstacle and in such decadence they will never find an ally in the democratic party. The new era will be a programmatic era of a new ethos and a new style of political understanding. Thank you very much, be well.", "text_el": "\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2, \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce

Unfortunately, time is condensed and I have to do a lot of events together to catch up. But it is very hopeful that on every side of the country the climate has changed. The party has a dynamic presence, which with our daily struggle until May 21, I am confident will translate into a strong turnout that will create the conditions for a bold change in our country. Our vision is a strong Greece with dignity, with self-confidence, with social justice. This is the progressive vision and the agony of every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive citizen. We are always faithful to our timeless values. But always with modern convincing answers that take into account the new facts of the times and of course the new conditions created by the rapid developments taking place at the global level. We believe that Greece can walk with its head held high in the world and especially in the geopolitical space of Europe, to shape a framework of prosperity for all citizens.

Today we present a section which has 12 important political initiatives. They are the 12 priorities of our programme. These are the priorities we will go forward with. With honesty and before the national elections, but even more so by breaking the established perceptions, we say and do other things just after the national elections, because the dominant feature of our policy is to build a new relationship of trust with the Greek people, especially with the new generation that was shaken both by Mr. Tsipras' Syriza and Mr. Mitsotakis' New Democracy. That is why I am talking about programmatic convergences that we will seek in the formation of a possible government if we have a strong presence in the next Parliament. This government, our participation in a government guarantees these changes to ensure that the driver is the public interest, the interest of the citizens, of many citizens, and not the preservation of the privileges of the domestic elite and vested interests. When it is not reduced to a meaningless and odious sharing of chairs, to its own children and I am talking about the familiar mindsets that settle the various politicians. Immediately after every national election. Personally, with this presence, I am not entering into a game of benefit competition, as we have seen in the last week between Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis. This game is unfortunately inexpensive for them, but very expensive for the Greek people, as has been seen in the years of the economic crisis, when New Democracy handed us a bankrupt economy with huge external deficits. But that was not all that happened before the financial crisis. It is also the unrepentant attitude of these parties after the financial crisis. After the self-realization of the magnitude of the problem. Zapia, the Thessaloniki programmes and the conscious mockery that was dubbed an illusion to wash away the responsibilities of extreme populism. We are therefore building today the alliance, the social alliance for the brave new change with the creative forces of the country, with healthy entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers who want to stand on their feet with their heads held high, producers, livestock farmers, away from state-sponsored logic, interconnectedness and corruption, with citizens who want a state that provides stability, security and access to quality goods. For all citizens with those who are currently called upon to negotiate extortionately by the funds, without criteria and without rules. We owe it to all these people to provide redemptive solutions and a second chance, dignity for their lives. With those who need the support of a modern and effective welfare state that leads to empowerment, inclusion and not dependency. From temporary allowances that can or try to replace services that simply never happens, because there is not enough money in the allowance policy to replace services that exist in other European states in strong social models. We call on young people who want to break the hostage of clientelism and crony governments. We owe it to them to guarantee that their fear of living worse than their parents who live worse than their parents will be a bad past. They are our allies, they are the ones we are referring to, they are the ones we want to express, and they are the ones I call on to give us a strong mandate with a change resolution on May 21. These are the people who want to stand by us, who we will always stand by and who we aspire to never let down.", "word_count_en": 593, "text_el": "\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9

The first priority is a modern state with transparency, meritocracy, accountability and decentralisation. What does this mean? No decision is legitimate without publication on Transparency. No more direct commissions, in which Mr Mitsotakis is a champion. Evaluation of public officials and services everywhere and of course evaluation not by the party-appointed, fair, objective and not partisan evaluation. Drastic, of course, limitation of the number of post-employees in the ministries. Mr Mitsotakis was saying, Mr Tsipras had 2,800 and denounced him, and now it has reached over 3,500 and it is Friday today. No recruitment in the public sector outside the APSEP. The selection of senior management and this is a commitment that I repeat every day. Every public institution, governors, boards of directors, hospitals, all with an open international competition with a five-year term, so that we break the partisan cycle of elections that creates turmoil in the state and of course with commensurate financial rewards so that there is a strong incentive and people with very high scientific training come in. Decentralization with boldness, transfer of all executive powers and corresponding resources to the local government. We made the big reforms in local government, with both the left and the right against us. We have a duty to continue and make Greece a normal European country at the level of self-government, emulating the practices of countries that have a very long history in these institutions. And of course, digital change in the state for the service of the citizen, but also for the accountability of the administration, evaluation of services by citizens through digital applications.",

We did not imagine a few years ago that this issue would be so high on our priorities. We thought that the country after the years of post-independence had overcome these evils, these incredible and unbelievable distortions. In the end we were wrong, which is why we are proposing to upgrade the role of independent authorities to monitor and submit rules both to the state and to the markets. We created the independent authorities. We still support them today, and it is really outside the European framework the unethical attacks that are being made both by Mr Mitsotakis's system and against Mr Tsipras's system in the past on people who are fighting to keep Greece anchored in European values, and this shows that they are not politicians who really believe in these values, they are just ready to instrumentalise everything just for power, just for the chair. And that is one reason why this party will be the democratic party throughout time. I want to tell you that this is why I am committed to repealing the provisions of the New Democracy Act on the issues of the wiretapping cover-up. A substantive role in the DPA decisions on legal intercepts. Commission of Inquiry without the abuse of secrecy. And of course, a law that allows victims to be informed and not over a three-year period, so that the person who has committed the crime can be in civil protection for an extended period of time. Strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and it is sad that even today in the latest reports of the European Commission and the European institutions, this thing is put as a priority for Greece. We have a duty to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.

What does this mean? Increasing the funding of the NHS to the European average and strengthening its infrastructure with 8 to 10% of the resources of the Recovery Fund. Today New Democracy is essentially giving 2%. It reaches 4% because the energy upgrade of buildings is added up. You know it is unthinkable, when the Greek people, after many years of the economic adventure of new inequality, impoverishment, are third in private spending in the entire European Union, having also salaries - we are only surpassed by Bulgaria and Lithuania - Europe is making a fund specifically for the pandemic. And this fund is barely used. For this huge issue that concerns every Greek and especially the most vulnerable Greeks. So what are we saying about this? Repeal of Article 10 of the recent law of the New Democracy, which undermines the public character of the NHS, a strong and unified system of primary health care under public supervision with health centres in every municipality and integrated family medicine services everywhere. New modern hospitals which, as I said earlier, will have meritocratic selected administrations, utilisation of digital capabilities for full-day operation, especially in the interventional and surgical sectors. It is not possible in 2023 that we will not have followed these new scientific methods, which are improving health across Europe, and of course, we have a debt for a new health map. But this new health map will not be in political or politicised terms, it will be an objective new health map with hospital care for densely populated areas, the most important and pharaonic example being East Attica. But also in the rest of Greece based on population, based on the need of the summer which is still growing, the population due to tourism and the ageing of the population, we have to create this new objective health map. Create innovative care units outside hospitals for chronic diseases and day care, strengthen public rehabilitation centres and create new ones and fill all the real gaps in the NHS with permanent recruitment and transparent procedures, increase salaries at least at the level of the average of the European Union to attract highly qualified staff, but also to stop young health workers leaving abroad, which every day creates a huge issue for the future of the national system. Our commitment is to include all health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category. This was discussed, we had tabled an amendment in Parliament, but it was not passed by the government, a radical overhaul of the system for obtaining a specialty and an increase in the salaries of specialists. There must also be incentives for specialties that have been eliminated from the NHS, resulting in hundreds of surgeries being constantly postponed, fully staffed hospitals, health centres on our islands. It is a huge problem, as we have seen with a recent example in Serifos. Financial incentives. Covering housing costs, especially in areas with strong tourism, subsidies for attracting scientific potential to the region, support and increase of mental health structures, a huge deficit in our country compared to the European average and their integration into the primary care system, free medicines for vulnerable groups, low pensioners and the unemployed. No one alone, on the margins. This is a clear message from the democratic party. An increase in the social solidarity allowance, universal care services for children, the elderly, the homeless, single-parent families. Disability mainstreaming in all state policies and, of course, disability benefits should follow increases in the minimum wage.", "word_count_en": 603, "text_el": "\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae

The second vital system for every social democrat, for every socialist, is education. These days, the shade war between Syriza and New Democracy has been reopened. University police, Article 16, admission for all without exams. Let us discuss and talk about the essence of the problem of education in Greece. So we are talking very specifically about this new modern model of public education, which has no rivalry with the private sector, but has a duty to support the public sector so that every Greek child has equal opportunities to stand on his or her own two feet. If the young generation does not stand on its own two feet, our country will never stand on its own two feet, and this is the message for the great reform that we owe to public education in our country. Remedial teaching programmes to close learning gaps and address inequalities. Utilisation of digital potential, a computer for every pupil and every teacher and an interactive computer board in every classroom, implementation of European quality indicators and opening up the school to environmental education, art and, of course, health education, where we are also lagging far behind, with the result that there is a huge issue of prevention and a culture of health in the country. Support for all-day kindergarten and primary school with a reformed educational programme, certification of foreign language and computer up to the third grade, upgrading of vocational education and lifelong learning, registration of professions and definition of professional rights. All-round support for special education and its structures, so that we finally have the real school of inclusion, a safe school environment and psychological and social support services to deal with the phenomena of violence that have escalated in our schools. I heard the Minister of Education in an interview, I think it was the other day, complain that we have about 3,000 psychologists and social workers, but she did not say how many schools we have, which is almost 23-24,000. Friends. Safe introduction of the national baccalaureate. It is very critical to the future of education. We are not saying abolish the exams. Students will hear that elsewhere. Because all over the world there are exams too. The question is what exams are there? We aspire that a person's future should not be judged on an exam. That is why we are talking about introducing the national baccalaureate. There will be exams in the last 2 years of study. This is also the case in Germany and France and other countries, but not in a single examination to decide your future. With all that this implies. So what are we talking about? The aim is to give content back to education, to public education, not to make secondary school and high school a parergroup. And, of course, through this new policy, to reduce the burden that every family has to bear from the school fees. So, through the national baccalaureate, we are making secondary school and high school the focus of this process again, so that young people can reach university. Outward-looking universities with links to production, local development, with research funding at the European Union average and innovation and, of course, meritocracy in academic development. We know the chronic pathologies that the Greek university has in the issues of internal meritocracy, upgrading and financial support for teachers at all levels of education and evaluation of educational work and its contributors.", "word_count_en": 574, "text_el": "\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9. \u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf

The main objective of our programme is to give a second chance to the Greeks who have struggled fairly, objectively, but who have not endured, and we propose redemptive solutions. We do not want them to be held hostage by the funds, of course, and by the government of the day, which is unable to legislate. So that is why we are calling for the reinstatement of the protection of the first home under Law 3869 of 2010. Of course with updated criteria and objective criteria in relation to how much they have paid off their loan. The price of the house and other criteria that will protect the first home of every vulnerable Greek 120 instalments for the arrangements of debts to tax authorities and social security funds and of course a 30% haircut for those who are punctual. Rules of operation for funds: lower instalments, fixed interest rates and viable arrangements for borrowers and, of course, universal protection for agricultural land, especially when millions of euros of red loans from cooperatives have gone to funds, which do not want any arrangements. They want sudden death and quick profit. It is our duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy, which has been led by Mr Tsipras' alleged Stisakhtia and Mr Mitsotakis' ineptitude. A solution for borrowers with a Swiss franc clause. We are the only ones who have engaged very substantially with legislative initiatives for these 80 000 families. What are we saying?

For us, demography is a huge issue. It is this issue that undermines society, the economy, the welfare state, every aspect of our country's life. So we have to put the younger generation at the forefront, without the younger generation at the centre of our policies, we cannot address the demographic. That's why we have announced, we were the first to put it in the public debate, the creation of a pool of 150,000 social housing units that will be either built from resources - new resources from the Recovery Fund, something that other countries have tried to do. Or by providing incentives, tax incentives or incentives, to reconstruct old houses to owners, so that they can put them into the social pool those houses are not given for purchase with low-interest loans, as Mr Mitsotakis is doing. We are not building a citizen-customer relationship with new ownership. We are practicing a time-resistant policy. What does that mean? They will be given at a very low rent, with social criteria, so that not only 150,000 families will benefit, but also thousands of families in the wider areas, and through competition we will help to de-escalate the already increased rents in homes that will not have been included in the programme, and this is what examples from other countries show. So with our policy, we will not only support 150,000 families, but also hundreds of thousands of other families. It is a solid policy that 150,000 is a stepping stone. We aspire to start from there to go to the models and levels of countries such as Portugal, Spain, Austria, Germany. And this is particularly important if we take a walk around the region where this event is taking place. Here, rents used to be very, very low. And today, all over the centre of Athens, rents because of short-term rentals, the lack of rules on the part of the state, compared to initiatives taken by other municipalities and other countries in Southern Europe, are prohibitive for a student who wants to study in Athens, for a person who wants to start his life by living in the city centre.", "word_count_en": 377, "text_el":

Tax system. As Social Democrats we serve the policy of progressive taxation, fair, progressive taxation. Our priorities now are to reduce taxes on labour, to help develop good jobs. Cutting VAT on basic foodstuffs. And of course, as far as the energy and economic crisis is concerned. Substantial market controls to crack down on obscenity. We are an immature market, it is too easy to speculate on the internal market, prices rise too fast and deflate too slowly because the market does not work capping the retail price of energy and of course reducing by 50% the unacceptably high tax-free threshold for parental benefits. And I say this because don't imagine 5% will make 4.8 million 2,400. What we are saying is that the limit of 800,000 should become 400,000 for the weak and middle class without the proliferation of the creative thinking of the New Democracy government that baptized social justice the tax-free parental benefit up to 4.8 million euros. This is not for the vulnerable and the middle class. This is only for the elites that Mr Mitsotakis's New Democracy faithfully serves, and let us put an end to the contempt for the public interest. Friends, a gradual, progressive increase in the tax rate on distributed dividends, which is one of the lowest in the European Union, and of course, extraordinary taxation of the excess profits of banks and large companies in monopoly sectors of the economy. It is something that other countries did when they saw deposit rates have the biggest gap with mortgage rates. And when we were saying it a year ago we were populists, but when the banks were giving Mr Mitsotakis' election gift for a few borrowers, it was a good policy. Unfortunately, it seems that powerful financial interests very much want this government to stay as it is for one reason only, because it puts no obstacles in the way of their incredible increase in

There cannot be a strong welfare state without strong production. You cannot have a welfare state of a central European country, but your production is weak, weak, uncompetitive. So we as social democrats have as our priority sustainable development, a resilient Greece, a productive Greece, so our priority is that 'Made in Greece' is a message to strengthen domestic production at every level. Primary sector, agri-food, manufacturing, extroversion, 'Made in Greece' everywhere. How will this be done? We cannot measure tourism only in terms of visitors. We have to set other criteria. It is one thing to have 10 million people come and another to make 20 billion. It is another thing to come 20 million and make 20 billion. It is another thing to go to 30 million and the country makes twice as much in its GDP. Are we measuring the added value of the current Greek tourism model? We do not aspire for Greece to become a giant hotel. We have other ambitions. And what are they? Quality tourism with measurable results where we will know every year what percentage of travellers consumed domestic products and how these products in the following months when they went to their countries are on the shelves of the European Union or third countries from Arabia to America. Why did the Portuguese do it because the Spaniards do it by imitating the Italians and the Portuguese by imitating the Spaniards? So we cannot imitate something that is healthy that respects the environment that respects man. Do we have to live after 10 years, being strangers on our islands?

Another point. Protection of the environment. A modern party cannot be silent about the environment and people when climate change is at a gallop. It is likely that the coming summer will be the hottest summer of our generation. So we must speak ahead of our time, it is not the first time. I remember many years PASOK had a comprehensive policy the environment and you remember very well how the right-wing conservationists dealt with this policy? We were confronted by New Democracy in 2007 on the issue of green growth, just as Trump confronted the Democrats in the United States of America in 2020. We must not forget that. We must not forget that when we spoke ahead of our time, some people were playing Pontius Pilate serving powerful economic interests, but it is not just them. Europe has a well-developed plan to decarbonise fossil fuels. Is that what the left has done in Greece? Did it serve fossil fuel decarbonisation? From lignite maybe, but by putting natural gas as a transitional fuel at such a level that the country was more vulnerable than any other country in the South to the energy crisis and even Mr Tsipras yesterday had the nerve to say the following and the agreements that only he has signed in 2019 for fossil resources in Greece will be in force. In other words, he has also linked us by making us deeply dependent on imported natural gas and he himself is now trying to undermine any attempt to make us independent. Obviously we have our first priority on renewables, but for that to happen it has to be done gradually, not by putting foreign gas as a transitional fuel. But having our own natural gas, otherwise we have to change the whole geostrategic concept of the country for impending turbulence that will make us vulnerable to Turkey and other third countries. So we are talking about a very complex debate which, as I understand it, both our two political opponents are unable to have because their priority is not the just green transition, the democratisation of energy production, the tackling of energy inequalities and energy poverty, but the service of the powerful power producers, as has been proven by the huge subsidy policies with billions from the pockets of the Greek people. That is why our priority is access for all citizens and local authorities to renewable energy production as a priority. This is energy democracy. Only in this way can we wean ourselves off fossil fuels and natural gas. Subsidies for rooftop photovoltaic systems for domestic consumers, with priority for the poorest Greeks, investments in energy distribution and storage networks. Italy used the Recovery Fund to make a plant where it will create battery cogeneration is this, PPPs, private and public sector. You can't do a green transition without having a storage power. We don't even discuss these such serious issues. Fair transition in the western regions. If we look at the economic figures it is really desperate for Western Macedonia and for Megalopolis. Completion, excuse me, implementation of the green European agreement to achieve climate neutrality, completion of forest maps and forest inventory, strengthening of organic agricultural production, upgrading of recycling structures. Recycling at the average recycling cost of the European Union and not recycling, special recycling for Greece, where we pay several times more per tonne than other countries in the European Union. The country, as we are well aware, will be faced with rapid weather events.

Support for primary production and its people, measures to reduce the purchase costs of agricultural feed and fuel inputs, zero excise duty on agricultural oil - not for ever, of course - for the months of the energy crisis, that is, while this adventure is going on, support for energy communities, what I said earlier was a priority, farmers, livestock farmers, cooperatives, processors, so that they have stable production costs and central planning of production costs for the next 15 years and, of course, priority for organic farming, which is a priority. It is a big issue to create a resilient system for our water with a big land reclamation plan because I am afraid looking at the map, the drainage map of the country, that like we were talking about energy last year, if we don't do this big plan to support our farmers in relation to water and irrigation, we will be talking about water in the next few years like we were talking about energy costs this year. So that is why for us it is very important for the resilience of production to have a very big such planning throughout Greece. Of course, this also has to do with the culture of the producer that the Ministry of Rural Development has to contribute to and for the times of irrigation and the way for each product individually. These are models that other countries have. We unfortunately, the Ministry of Rural Development does not want and its current structure cannot play such a role. We must support this ministry. I remember, and I say this, an Italian Minister for Rural Development was telling me that Greece cannot fail to move in this direction, that it will be the first country in Europe to face such a big issue together with Cyprus on issues relating to water resources. Now, the introduction of tax-free and unconfiscated subsidies, compensation and aid for farmers and stockbreeders. Updating the ELGA regulation to cover disasters caused by climate change. The Ministry pretends not to know what climate change means in this matter of compensation. Accelerate investments from the new common agricultural policy programmes, abolish the runner-up beneficiary policy through proper resource planning, provide for decent working and housing conditions for foreign farm workers. This is a huge issue that concerns the entire Greek region. This year, the severe shortage of farm workers has caused too many people to see the fruit rotting on the trees. Very important extension issue, increase the Recovery Fund resources allocated to green and digital transformation of agricultural production and restructuring of low-yielding crops. Finally, creation of post high school agricultural schools for modern education of farmers. Incentives to employ young people in the primary sector and reduce their taxes so that they can be competitive and of course with the programme we had started in 2010 there should be free allocation of public land to have a policy of support for young farmers.", "word_count_en": 520, "text_el": "\u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd

I have finished the first chapter of our programme, I want to move on to the second. Well, I want to thank you very much for your patience. I hope that everything we have said will be a Gospel. This Gospel is the Gospel of the social democratic government that I aspire to have for Greece to become a normal European country. This is what we will negotiate if the Greeks honour us. All these will be the priorities of the negotiations of a strong government that will aim for the state to embrace the citizens' anxieties and not for the state to be hostage to the elitism of Mr Mitsotakis, the populism of Mr Tsipras and a common mentality, the spoils of power of their cronies. With us Demetrias, Pappas and party cronies who consider all that we say out of place in the face of chairs, power and interconnectedness, we will be an obstacle and in such decadence they will never find an ally in the democratic party. The new era will be a programmatic era of a new ethos and a new style of political understanding.
