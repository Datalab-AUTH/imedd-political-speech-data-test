A modern state must also effectively protect human rights. We did not imagine a few years ago that this issue would be so high on our priorities. We thought that the country after the years of post-independence had overcome these evils, these incredible and unbelievable distortions. In the end we were wrong, which is why we are proposing to upgrade the role of independent authorities to monitor and submit rules both to the state and to the markets. We created the independent authorities. We still support them today, and it is really outside the European framework the unethical attacks that are being made both by Mr Mitsotakis's system and against Mr Tsipras's system in the past on people who are fighting to keep Greece anchored in European values, and this shows that they are not politicians who really believe in these values, they are just ready to instrumentalise everything just for power, just for the chair. And that is one reason why this party will be the democratic party throughout time. I want to tell you that this is why I am committed to repealing the provisions of the New Democracy Act on the issues of the wiretapping cover-up. A substantive role in the DPA decisions on legal intercepts. Commission of Inquiry without the abuse of secrecy. And of course, a law that allows victims to be informed and not over a three-year period, so that the person who has committed the crime can be in civil protection for an extended period of time. Strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and it is sad that even today in the latest reports of the European Commission and the European institutions, this thing is put as a priority for Greece. We have a duty to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. That is why we say that the selection of its supreme leadership must be made by Parliament with an increased majority.
