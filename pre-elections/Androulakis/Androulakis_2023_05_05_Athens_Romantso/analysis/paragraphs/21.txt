So that's why we are proposing a national strategic development plan with a change in the priorities of the Recovery Fund to support domestic production with the creation of new jobs, regional development with the interconnection of tourism, as we said, with all sectors of the Greek economy. Three-year exemption from capital gains tax for new schemes resulting from partnerships and networking of SMEs, special lines of funding from the Recovery Fund for SME investment in innovation, energy adaptation, digital transformation, creation of development centres in the regions to provide technical assistance in design, standardisation, development of new products and their distribution networks. And of course, funding from the NSRF for the relocation of SMEs to organised craft parks to finally put a stop to this incredible distortion that is happening to businesses across Greece. Connection, and that is another matter, but very important for the economy.
