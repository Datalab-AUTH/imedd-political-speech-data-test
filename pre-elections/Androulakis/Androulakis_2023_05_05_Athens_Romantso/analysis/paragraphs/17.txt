Another point of our programme, of our priorities, is the major objective of tackling the national demographic issue. For us, demography is a huge issue. It is this issue that undermines society, the economy, the welfare state, every aspect of our country's life. So we have to put the younger generation at the forefront, without the younger generation at the centre of our policies, we cannot address the demographic. That's why we have announced, we were the first to put it in the public debate, the creation of a pool of 150,000 social housing units that will be either built from resources - new resources from the Recovery Fund, something that other countries have tried to do. Or by providing incentives, tax incentives or incentives, to reconstruct old houses to owners, so that they can put them into the social pool those houses are not given for purchase with low-interest loans, as Mr Mitsotakis is doing. We are not building a citizen-customer relationship with new ownership. We are practicing a time-resistant policy. What does that mean? They will be given at a very low rent, with social criteria, so that not only 150,000 families will benefit, but also thousands of families in the wider areas, and through competition we will help to de-escalate the already increased rents in homes that will not have been included in the programme, and this is what examples from other countries show. So with our policy, we will not only support 150,000 families, but also hundreds of thousands of other families. It is a solid policy that 150,000 is a stepping stone. We aspire to start from there to go to the models and levels of countries such as Portugal, Spain, Austria, Germany. And this is particularly important if we take a walk around the region where this event is taking place. Here, rents used to be very, very low. And today, all over the centre of Athens, rents because of short-term rentals, the lack of rules on the part of the state, compared to initiatives taken by other municipalities and other countries in Southern Europe, are prohibitive for a student who wants to study in Athens, for a person who wants to start his life by living in the city centre.
