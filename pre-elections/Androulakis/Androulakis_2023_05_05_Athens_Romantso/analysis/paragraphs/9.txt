Friends in the programmatic framework now. The first priority is a modern state with transparency, meritocracy, accountability and decentralisation. What does this mean? No decision is legitimate without publication on Transparency. No more direct commissions, in which Mr Mitsotakis is a champion. Evaluation of public officials and services everywhere and of course evaluation not by the party-appointed, fair, objective and not partisan evaluation. Drastic, of course, limitation of the number of post-employees in the ministries. Mr Mitsotakis was saying, Mr Tsipras had 2,800 and denounced him, and now it has reached over 3,500 and it is Friday today. No recruitment in the public sector outside the APSEP. The selection of senior management and this is a commitment that I repeat every day. Every public institution, governors, boards of directors, hospitals, all with an open international competition with a five-year term, so that we break the partisan cycle of elections that creates turmoil in the state and of course with commensurate financial rewards so that there is a strong incentive and people with very high scientific training come in. Decentralization with boldness, transfer of all executive powers and corresponding resources to the local government. We made the big reforms in local government, with both the left and the right against us. We have a duty to continue and make Greece a normal European country at the level of self-government, emulating the practices of countries that have a very long history in these institutions. And of course, digital change in the state for the service of the citizen, but also for the accountability of the administration, evaluation of services by citizens through digital applications.
