I have tired you of the last point of our programme, but from the very beginning when I was elected president, what we are told is that we have no seats. The truth is that we are never asked about seats. We are asked about other questions, we are not asked about positions, so I am going to get my grudge out on you. I apologize. We're tired of Dimitri and the guys going on the air and our candidates for Congress going on and on about the toxicity and divisiveness. And I really want to ask you in these few remaining days to bring out a different political ethos and a different political style. It is a question of educating ourselves against the digital parasite, against the devaluation of public debate.
