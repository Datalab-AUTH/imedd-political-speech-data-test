Friends, thank you very much for your presence. Unfortunately, time is condensed and I have to do a lot of events together to catch up. But it is very hopeful that on every side of the country the climate has changed. The party has a dynamic presence, which with our daily struggle until May 21, I am confident will translate into a strong turnout that will create the conditions for a bold change in our country. Our vision is a strong Greece with dignity, with self-confidence, with social justice. This is the progressive vision and the agony of every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive citizen. We are always faithful to our timeless values. But always with modern convincing answers that take into account the new facts of the times and of course the new conditions created by the rapid developments taking place at the global level. We believe that Greece can walk with its head held high in the world and especially in the geopolitical space of Europe, to shape a framework of prosperity for all citizens. A new modern model that will serve the people and the country. But this requires overcoming harsh conservative management policies.
