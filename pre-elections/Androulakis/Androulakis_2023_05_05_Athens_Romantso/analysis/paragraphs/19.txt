Another point of our programme. Tax system. As Social Democrats we serve the policy of progressive taxation, fair, progressive taxation. Our priorities now are to reduce taxes on labour, to help develop good jobs. Cutting VAT on basic foodstuffs. And of course, as far as the energy and economic crisis is concerned. Substantial market controls to crack down on obscenity. We are an immature market, it is too easy to speculate on the internal market, prices rise too fast and deflate too slowly because the market does not work capping the retail price of energy and of course reducing by 50% the unacceptably high tax-free threshold for parental benefits. And I say this because don't imagine 5% will make 4.8 million 2,400. What we are saying is that the limit of 800,000 should become 400,000 for the weak and middle class without the proliferation of the creative thinking of the New Democracy government that baptized social justice the tax-free parental benefit up to 4.8 million euros. This is not for the vulnerable and the middle class. This is only for the elites that Mr Mitsotakis's New Democracy faithfully serves, and let us put an end to the contempt for the public interest. Friends, a gradual, progressive increase in the tax rate on distributed dividends, which is one of the lowest in the European Union, and of course, extraordinary taxation of the excess profits of banks and large companies in monopoly sectors of the economy. It is something that other countries did when they saw deposit rates have the biggest gap with mortgage rates. And when we were saying it a year ago we were populists, but when the banks were giving Mr Mitsotakis' election gift for a few borrowers, it was a good policy. Unfortunately, it seems that powerful financial interests very much want this government to stay as it is for one reason only, because it puts no obstacles in the way of their incredible increase in financial power.
