Our aim is to contribute to the courageous changes that the European Union needs, so that it does not get trapped again, as it did in 2009, in harsh austerity policies, which were imposed when powerful states put their own interests first and not the whole and the solidarity of all European peoples. That is why my proposal at the last Council was also to create a strong new European economic sovereignty fund, with additional funding to support the productive base, particularly in the countries of the South that have a traditional problem of low competitiveness, so that we can both contain the production that has left for third countries, especially China, but also other peripheral countries, and at the same time create strong jobs that will create a framework of low unemployment for young people in the South.
