Friends, we want an open, non-discriminatory society, as I said before, on the basis of race, gender, religion and sexual orientation. I want older people to remember that it was our party that made the brave institutional changes in the 1980s, showing the European way of these great social reforms. We have a duty to continue them in the standards of the European framework.
