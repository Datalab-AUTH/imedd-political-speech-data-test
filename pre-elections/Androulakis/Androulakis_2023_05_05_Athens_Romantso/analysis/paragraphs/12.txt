Work. Work with rules and dignity. The minimum wage will be set by the social partners through a national general collective agreement. Immediate thawing of three-year contracts and universal compulsory application of sectoral agreements, abolition of the provisions of the laws of the New Democracy that remove labour rights on working hours and protection from illegal dismissals or weaken the control mechanisms of the state. The new forms of work, which are now too numerous in modern times, must be regulated with rules for safety and the worker, presumption of paid employment for workers on platforms and distribution of goods. A new pay scale for civil servants with increases in grades to cover inflation losses and the creation of a merit-based system to reward the effort of civil servants.
