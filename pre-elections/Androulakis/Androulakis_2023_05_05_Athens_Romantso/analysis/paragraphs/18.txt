Friends. Another element of support for the new generation. Recruitment of 50,000 young unemployed people in the private sector with a four-year programme to subsidise employer contributions in full-time jobs. We subsidise work and do not support policies that increase unemployment. Tax incentives for young people who start business and professional activities. Construction of new quality halls of residence, restoration of the tax credit for children studying away from home. No child out of nurseries or creative activity centres. We owe it to the Greek mother to be a universal policy. Granting an additional monthly allowance of â‚¬200 for each new child born up to the age of 3, based on income criteria.
