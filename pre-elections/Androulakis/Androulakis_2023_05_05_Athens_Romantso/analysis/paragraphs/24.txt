That is why I have served as an MEP and I aspire to do so as a government, to create a modern national civil protection mechanism, where the fire brigade will be the main arm of this effort with permanent jobs and with internal meritocracy in the fire brigade and always with reinforcement, with modern aerial means. We have already taken initiatives at European level for the new Canadian line. We will have them in our hands in a few years. And always with modernised civil protection plans that will also have the understanding of other countries that are ahead in modern civil protection methods. Finally, protection of water resources with new infrastructure and networks. It is obvious, I do not need to say it, but I have to say it so that it is not considered that I have forgotten, no discussion about the privatisation of water in our country.
