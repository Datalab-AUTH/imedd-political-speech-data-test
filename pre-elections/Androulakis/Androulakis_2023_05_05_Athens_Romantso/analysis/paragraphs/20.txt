Friends, production. There cannot be a strong welfare state without strong production. You cannot have a welfare state of a central European country, but your production is weak, weak, uncompetitive. So we as social democrats have as our priority sustainable development, a resilient Greece, a productive Greece, so our priority is that 'Made in Greece' is a message to strengthen domestic production at every level. Primary sector, agri-food, manufacturing, extroversion, 'Made in Greece' everywhere. How will this be done? We cannot measure tourism only in terms of visitors. We have to set other criteria. It is one thing to have 10 million people come and another to make 20 billion. It is another thing to come 20 million and make 20 billion. It is another thing to go to 30 million and the country makes twice as much in its GDP. Are we measuring the added value of the current Greek tourism model? We do not aspire for Greece to become a giant hotel. We have other ambitions. And what are they? Quality tourism with measurable results where we will know every year what percentage of travellers consumed domestic products and how these products in the following months when they went to their countries are on the shelves of the European Union or third countries from Arabia to America. Why did the Portuguese do it because the Spaniards do it by imitating the Italians and the Portuguese by imitating the Spaniards? So we cannot imitate something that is healthy that respects the environment that respects man. Do we have to live after 10 years, being strangers on our islands? No, we disagree with this perverse model of development. So we want all this to be a package of a visionary policy that respects the Greek citizen, that respects the environment, that respects the country.
