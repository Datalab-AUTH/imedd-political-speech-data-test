Another element of our policy. It is social justice as far as private debt is concerned. The main objective of our programme is to give a second chance to the Greeks who have struggled fairly, objectively, but who have not endured, and we propose redemptive solutions. We do not want them to be held hostage by the funds, of course, and by the government of the day, which is unable to legislate. So that is why we are calling for the reinstatement of the protection of the first home under Law 3869 of 2010. Of course with updated criteria and objective criteria in relation to how much they have paid off their loan. The price of the house and other criteria that will protect the first home of every vulnerable Greek 120 instalments for the arrangements of debts to tax authorities and social security funds and of course a 30% haircut for those who are punctual. Rules of operation for funds: lower instalments, fixed interest rates and viable arrangements for borrowers and, of course, universal protection for agricultural land, especially when millions of euros of red loans from cooperatives have gone to funds, which do not want any arrangements. They want sudden death and quick profit. It is our duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy, which has been led by Mr Tsipras' alleged Stisakhtia and Mr Mitsotakis' ineptitude. A solution for borrowers with a Swiss franc clause. We are the only ones who have engaged very substantially with legislative initiatives for these 80 000 families. What are we saying? Fair distribution of exchange rate risk. One third will be borne by the borrower and two thirds by the banking institutions that made these loans.
