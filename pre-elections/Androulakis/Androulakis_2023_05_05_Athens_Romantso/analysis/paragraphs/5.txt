Our goal is to change the state to serve and emancipate the citizen by creating transparency, meritocracy and to operate with accountability, to be decentralized away from traditional clientelism, to restore the credibility of the political system by strengthening the institutions and by regaining the lost trust of the Greek people through the daily struggle for the separation of powers.
