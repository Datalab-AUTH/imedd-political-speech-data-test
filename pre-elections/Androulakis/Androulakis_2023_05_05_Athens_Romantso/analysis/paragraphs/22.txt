We cannot just be consumers of arms programmes. We must also become producers of armaments programmes. And indeed, as a NATO country, when these weapons are sold to third countries, they also have very great economic benefits for the domestic economy. That is why we say linking arms programmes with support for our defence and shipbuilding economy. Nothing will happen without the country's co-production, and we have a duty to take initiatives to revise Community directives that put obstacles in the way of such a new policy that will put Greece at the forefront of the map of co-producers. Restoring national control of the superfund and transforming it into a fund for the exploitation of public assets.
