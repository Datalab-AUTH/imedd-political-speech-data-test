Our aim is to ensure strong sustainable growth that will enable the economy to stand on its feet regionally with competitiveness. Inward-looking by exploiting modern digital capabilities in all sectors of production and always respecting the environment. The benefits of this policy cannot be only for the few and the powerful; they must be spread to the whole of Greek society. That is why we are talking about a progressive tax system that ensures the necessary resources to reduce inequalities and fight poverty, development linked to the real needs of the people that guarantees a better life for the working man, so that he can live in a house he can afford access to housing. With dignity and low cost to get after several years of life a decent pension and feel secure in a health system that supports him in the hard times and not as we live today. A total decline. With policies that support the Greek family to be able to make ends meet, with social structures and a quality public education system for all the children of the Greek people. Our goal is to offer young people fair and equal opportunities to live, to develop in their own country, to get an education, to work with decent wages, to start a family.
