Friends. Our main programmatic objective is decent pensions for pensioners. That is why we are talking about a new ESAS that will affect 350,000 low-income pensioners. Change the SYRIZA and New Democracy laws and strengthen the contributory nature of pensions, abolish the personal differential from 1/01/2024 and promote occupational funds.
