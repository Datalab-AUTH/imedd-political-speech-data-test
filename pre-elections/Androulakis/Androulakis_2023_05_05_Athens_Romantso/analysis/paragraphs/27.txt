Friends. I have finished the first chapter of our programme, I want to move on to the second. Well, I want to thank you very much for your patience. I hope that everything we have said will be a Gospel. This Gospel is the Gospel of the social democratic government that I aspire to have for Greece to become a normal European country. This is what we will negotiate if the Greeks honour us. All these will be the priorities of the negotiations of a strong government that will aim for the state to embrace the citizens' anxieties and not for the state to be hostage to the elitism of Mr Mitsotakis, the populism of Mr Tsipras and a common mentality, the spoils of power of their cronies. With us Demetrias, Pappas and party cronies who consider all that we say out of place in the face of chairs, power and interconnectedness, we will be an obstacle and in such decadence they will never find an ally in the democratic party. The new era will be a programmatic era of a new ethos and a new style of political understanding. Thank you very much, be well.
