Friends and friends. What unites them? They issued an announcement about Georgiou. They said a word about the vindication of this man, not because they both defend the same thing with the same fervour, the narrative of Mr Karamanlis, Karamalis and the democratic party do not go together, Mr Tsipras. Friends and friends ecostasies, but o end with the insolence, with the arrogance and the contempt of the Greek people. I ask that we fight to put up a mound. A mound against the policies of inequality, a mound against disparagement and institutional decline. All of us together stayed 9 days, stand proudly. The flag of PASOK to let the sun of social justice and national dignity rise again in our country. All together door to door village village take the case of PASOK's Renaissance in your hands together and here from Chania we send a strong message of victory, from one end to the other of the country. PASOK is back to spoil the plans. Of the domestic elite that wants Mitsotakis to be strong and Tsipras to sponsor strong Pasha means strong Laz. They were the people of Andreas Papandreou's movement as embracing the anxieties, hopes and prospects of every Greek. Good strength and good fight to us here from the democratic years here from the Crete of the Games. Of democracy, of the freedom of the nation. We send a message of solidarity and victory to every democrat and every progressive Greek all over Greece fight fight fight fight and on May 21 we will be victorious so that the new generation can stand up on its feet and stand so upright on its feet. The homeland, good strength and good fight.
