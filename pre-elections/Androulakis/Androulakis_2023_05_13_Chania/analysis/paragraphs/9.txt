9 days left and we are fighting against two dangerous systems of power that instead of offering unity and perspective to the Greek people, they are playing dangerous games and offer only division and toxicity. Instead of hope they invest in fear. They do not hesitate to enlist their digital parastate to seize power. So I say here from Chania. From our homeland in Crete, do not give in to terrorism and fear. Invest in hope and perspective for you, your children and your grandchildren. Remember who is the party that gave dignity to the Greek people? Who is the party that built the great projects, Who is the party that brought quality democracy and who are those who condemn us to a land of lost opportunities by sending thousands of Greek children abroad. 21 May, the end of depravity. An end to division. Yes to hope, yes to perspective.
