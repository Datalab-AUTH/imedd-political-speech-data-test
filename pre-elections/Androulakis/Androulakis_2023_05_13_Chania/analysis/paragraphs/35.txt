And so I want us to remember. All those who are asking us today and even want progressive fronts and say that PASOK will go with New Democracy. Do they have the new democracy in their guts? I know that Mr Mitsotakis is in coalition with the People's Orthodox Rally, Liberal, he is playing the 3 top ministries, we have the children of Karatzaferis. Mr. Tsipras. He has progressive centre-leftists on his ballot papers. Find me a right-wing extremist on the PASOK ballot. And compare the Syriza ballots. This party is the progressive force of the country, because it has no Mr. Tsipras, no Antonarians, no orphans of the burned candidates all over Greece for the progressivism courses in, you, not in, of Andreas Papandreou.
