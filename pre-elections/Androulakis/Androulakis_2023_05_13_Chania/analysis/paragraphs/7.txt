So we are saying something very simple. We continue on our autonomous course and we do not want to drag anyone into blind conflicts. We say realistically what must happen for the future of the country. Mr Tsipras is propagandizing to scare the progressives that he says we have already settled with Mr Mitsotakis. But how can that be? Those of Syriza have come to terms with New Democracy and those of New Democracy have come to terms with Syriza. You know, all this rhetoric is aimed at only one thing. To stop this new course. That's why I call on each and every one of you to fight a 9-day race and on May 21 to send Tsipras and Mitsotakis to the dustbin of history. Enough of the toxicity and division they have offered to Greek society. PASOK is here united strong embracing the anguish and hope of all the Greek people.
