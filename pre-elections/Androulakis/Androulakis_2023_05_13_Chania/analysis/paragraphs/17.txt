What about the excess profits of large energy producers with the banks? We have given billions of euros, billions of euros in subsidies for the capital adequacy of the banks. What do we say? Anyone who earns more than what the Greek economy can afford should be taxed on their excess profits. This is what Spain has done. That is what we should do in Greece and not have banks that have the biggest difference between the interest rate on deposits and the interest rate on mortgages. That is social justice and not pampering the powerful at the expense of the people for the media to play on. And to hide the tragic responsibilities of the Mitsotakis government.
