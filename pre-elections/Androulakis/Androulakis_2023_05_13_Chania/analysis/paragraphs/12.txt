Trust means to feel that justice is indeed for all, that there is no impunity for the powerful. Dignity what does dignity mean in our time? Because many people don't discuss politics anymore, they don't trust what politicians say because they feel hurt, they feel their dignity is wounded.
So for us, dignity is that the weak Greek should not be afraid that he might lose his first home, that there should be no shame lists that the pensioner is afraid of. The next surgery and the unpleasant delays of constant postponements. The surgery due to lack of permanent staff in the NHS for young people dignity is to have access to a house at a cheap rent, decent housing to raise their family and children. This is the dignity that we, as PASOK, have a duty to give to the Greek people, because we are the party of Social Justice, the party that gave hope and prospects to vulnerable Greeks. Dignity means for the Greek children to do their computerised registration, not by looking at their grandparents' pockets, but by looking at their future and their dreams. That is dignity. That's confidence. This is the new beginning that all of us together on May 21 will make the bold changes for a strong Greece of social justice and national dignity. We have a duty to build sustainable growth in the Greek economy that creates quality jobs, away from an unfair tax system, to reduce inequalities and of course to create outward-looking investments with competition, with strong exports, not to hand over hundreds of thousands of businesses, farmers, ranchers, cooperatives. Their property to the crows of the funds and to deflate the Greek economy. There too we have a duty as a patriotic movement to prevent this dangerous de-fellatinization.
