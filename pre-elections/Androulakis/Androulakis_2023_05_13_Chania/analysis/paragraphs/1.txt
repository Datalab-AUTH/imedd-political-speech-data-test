Friends, here in Chania today we are sending a message of victory and hope for the rebirth of PASOK throughout Greece to all democrats, to all progressive Greeks. We are a few days before the upcoming national elections. Critical national elections, where our political opponents, who used to say that they wanted cooperation with PASOK, now have only one goal: to stop the rise of the democratic party. Their problem is PASOK. That is the real opponent of Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipras. They see the danger of ungovernability. There is no danger of ungovernability. After the elections there will be a government. There is a danger of immobility, arrogance and institutional decline, which is the main focus of the system of Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
