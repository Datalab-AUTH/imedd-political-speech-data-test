So that is why we are committed here in Chania. That we will make health centers primary care throughout Greece. We will get a permanent staff of 15,000 doctors. We will raise the salaries of our health workers to the average of the European Union and we will include them in the heavy and unhealthy sector so that they get what they deserve and not just the clapping of the mockery in the middle of the Covid pandemic. Friends, you are well aware of what is happening in the health centres of Kandanos Kissamos in the Multipurpose Medical Centre of Sfakia. What we are saying about health is a priority and it is a priority that we cannot have millions of travellers in Crete and our islands every year, but the support given to the NHS does not take into account this great diversification of the population in the summer months. So we want a new health map that takes into account the real data of the EU age population, but also the changes that have to do with tourism in the summer. So we will support with 10%, 8-10% from the NHS Recovery Fund and not the 2-4% that Mr Mitsotakis has from the lowest rates across Europe. For one reason alone he does not want health as a social good. He wants health as a gift to powerful economic interests to speculate on the backs of the pensioner and the middle class. So for the twenty-one but o strong NHS and not NHS in the hands of oligarchs at the expense of the Greek people.
