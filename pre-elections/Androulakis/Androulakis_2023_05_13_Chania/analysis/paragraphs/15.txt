Greece and friends. We have a duty to talk about our economy, but what economy? With the fake statistics? That everything is going well that wages have gone up 20% and salaries have gone up 20% but what it says 7.4% real wages have gone down. 5 billion more in taxes paid by the Greek people. Yes, but Mr Mitsotakis says that he has reduced all rates. How is that possible? Because he is simply reducing the rates a little for the many. And a lot for the powerful, because the revaluations and accuracy have made the state's revenues 66% indirect taxes that mainly hit the weak and the middle class. What do we say about all this? What do we say about growth that 700,000 jobs are up to 500â‚¬ for the new generation What do they do? The one place because of flexibility 2 places can be so upright or society? Can so the young generation can have a family? They wonder why Greek children continue to leave abroad? But that's why. Because we have an unfair development, a development that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. On the other hand, Mr Tsipras is handing out money as he did in 2015. But he probably doesn't know a principle. It's good to get milk from the cow, but where and when to learn to feed for the cow? Because in the end the cow dies.
