Friends of this party. With a specific programme it wants to change Greece again. But what is the word change? It is a slogan to argue about who will put it first behind him or on his flag or in his speech. Change is history. So that is why I call on all generations of the country to remember modern history. Who built the public hospitals? Who supported public education, Who built the great projects, Who are the ones who made the great reforms with asep, with clarity, with independent authorities? Who are the ones who put Cyprus in the European Union to defend the island against Turkey? Who are all those who made the Greek people live without discrimination for political beliefs? Religion sexual orientation or class do you want? Is she here? The party is PASOK, so I ask you to trust the party of great changes and not the parties that put up coherent obstacles to Andreas Papandreou for these great changes.
