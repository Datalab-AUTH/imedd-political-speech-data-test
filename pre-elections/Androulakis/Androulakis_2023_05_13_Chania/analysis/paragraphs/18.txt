Also a very crucial issue is property taxes. What do we say to lower the ENVIA more for the poor and less for the powerful? But that is all. The inheritance tax on parental benefits? Is it possible for an impoverished Greece to have a tax-free parental benefit with a law of the Mitsotakis government up to 4.8 million euros? What grandparent can give up to EUR 4.8 million of property and mobile phones to a grandchild or child? It belongs to the middle class, No of course not, we are not saying the tax-free up to 400,000 â‚¬ that is a real policy for the middle class and from there onwards to put their pockets to pay tax for those who have billions of real estate.
