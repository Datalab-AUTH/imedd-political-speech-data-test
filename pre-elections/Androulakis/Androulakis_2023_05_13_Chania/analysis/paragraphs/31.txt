And I say this because there is no other way to have a stable cost of production, a low cost of living in the years after 2030. Pollutant trading will not only involve the steel mills and the big power generators. It will also involve the poorest European citizens, because we will be paying a carbon tax on energy-intensive houses and energy-intensive cars. Who has the most energy-intensive cars? But those who cannot change cars every five years. So I am in debt, just as PASOK told the truth to Karamanlis early on before the memoranda. Today in Chania, I must also speak the truth to Mitsotakis, who is leading the country back into fiscal adventures, and we have a debt to the populism of SYRIZA and the Hellenism of New Democracy. To tell the absolute truth to the Greek people for this now low cost policies for the production of the country.
