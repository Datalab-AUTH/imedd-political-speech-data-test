Friends and friends tomorrow is Mother's Day. This mother who symbolizes family, love for the homeland, giving. We have a huge duty to support the Greek mother, so my priority, apart from addressing the demographic issue, is to guarantee that every woman will not have her life turned upside down by having a family, but will have all the services of the state to continue her economic and social life normally. And what this means is no children, no Greek children. Out of day care centers and creative employment centers in the future. We have even taken an initiative, a legislative initiative, which of course was rejected by the government in the last Parliament, but we will mention to strengthen the maternity allowance for mothers of freelancers, who unfortunately for a long time are forced to return to work quickly. Because the family cannot afford it. So that is why this allowance will be at a minimum level of the minimum wage.
