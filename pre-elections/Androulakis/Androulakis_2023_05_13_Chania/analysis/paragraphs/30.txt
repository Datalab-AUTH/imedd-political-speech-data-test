Friends. Farmers. We once said that blood is not water. But today the Greek farmer, the Greek farmer, sees the cost of production rising rapidly, undermining his prospects. What do we do? We propose. That the cost of production must be reduced immediately, especially for agricultural supplies, animal feed, fuel, with zero excise duty on agricultural oil, as long as the energy crisis lasts and of course with the policy of renewable energy sources. But what policy were we told to expect from the cable? The cable came, you see another state of Crete for RES large parks for the few and not hundreds of small parks for small municipalities, farmers, farmers, farmers, cooperatives, processors, because there too they want to make the green transition business for the 5 oligarchs May 21, the green transition, renewable resources in the hands of the people to democratize energy production, as they do. All European countries.
