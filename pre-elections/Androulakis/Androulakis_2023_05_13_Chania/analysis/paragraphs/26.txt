Friends and friends, that's it. 80,000 families are held hostage by the Swiss franc. We have a clear proposal that 1/3 of the interest rate increase should be borne by the borrower and 2/3 by the banking institutions. These are all proposals that can give a second chance of dignity and not hold a large part of the middle class hostage. We want redemptive solutions to the demar signals of private debt. That is why we finally propose 120 installments for all EFKA and tax authorities, says Mr Mitsotakis. I did ask in Chania, how many people were able to join the 120 installments of Mr Mitsotakis? And you will understand the degree of contempt for the real problems of the Greek market. Very few were able to join this arrangement for us universally and even anyone who adheres to this arrangement until the end can reduce the initial amount to 30%.
