No more for farmers. Establishment of the unconfiscated and tax-free subsidies, compensation and aid and finally updating the insurance regulation of ELGA with extended coverage of disasters in the animal and plant kingdom due to climate change, the Ministry is acting against farmers, pretending not to know what climate change means when in the coming years and this year we will have one of the hottest summers. Climate change will continually hit domestic production.
