Friends. I have received a mandate.From 270,000 friends of the democratic party. I have pledged to you and I pledge to you here in Chania that I will not do them the favour of having a crutch leader. PASOK has returned as a leading actor, I understand. I understand that Mr Mitsotakis wanted another PASOK, an easy PASOK, a strategic ally. PASOK has history, social roots and dignity and will speak the word of progress and truth, without counting the cost. But who is giving me lessons? The leader of the Bats? Who speculated with millions of euro loans with the toil and sacrifice of the Greek people? The prime minister of fiscal populism who feeds rabbits and stones. He even said that he would increase private sector wages by 25 to 100. Here are many small businessmen and women how will he raise wages in the private sector 25%? By royal decree? In what economy? In the economy where there is currently a huge devaluation and over-taxation where thousands of small SMEs are being extorted by the funds? In this economy.
