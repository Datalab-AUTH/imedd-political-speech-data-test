Friends. Many generations have trusted PASOK over the years to make change possible and we want to make this change possible on 21 May with a state of dignity and perspective. I heard Mr Mitsotakis in the debate, in very simple terms, say that my monitoring. He does not say it had to be done because I was never a national danger. Of course, the New Democracy cadres what they were saying on TV, what I was writing on the Internet, what agents of China, Turkey, Armenia and various other such nonsense. But Mr Mitsotakis, with what he said. What is he implying? That surveillance is an act which creates a new situation for justice. The argument of legal surveillance, but politically incorrect, has now collapsed. We need the judiciary to do its job well and I expect it to call the prosecutor of the NIS, Mrs. Vasiliki Vlachou, who is in debt as a national danger to legalize my surveillance in between the democratic elections of PASOK. We will be the party that will guarantee the end of this institutional decline. The people do not forget what right-wing means, what maintenance means. And we have a duty to fight to prove that this party, with its rebirth, will show who the real opponent of the new democracy is. And certainly not the sponsors of the new democracy.
