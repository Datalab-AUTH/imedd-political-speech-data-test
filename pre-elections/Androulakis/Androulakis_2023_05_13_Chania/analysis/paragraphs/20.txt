Friends, this is not populism, because we do not give to everyone. We give and support those who really need it for pensioners.

And that is because Mr Mitsotakis says, 'Oh, Mr Tsipras, but he too is a populist in a tie, with what he is saying at the expense of future generations, reminiscent of Mr Karamanlis and the 2009 bankruptcy.
