I must admit that I find it difficult to understand what is going on with the Prime Minister, his arrogance had been noticed and had long ceased to surprise me.His lack of empathy was also something I had spotted and I was not at all surprised by his inability to identify with public sentiment and one or stand up for the problems facing the Greek people.What has always impressed me is the ease with which he distorts reality and underestimates our intelligence. Every day Kyriakos Mitsotakis reminds me more and more of Mr Tsipras. I did not expect him to compete with him in lying, questioning even the official OECD figures. The figures used by all the governments of the western world. But what leaves me stunned is his behaviour in the wiretapping scandal. From Rhodes he addressed his friends of PASOK to all of you, saying that we have moved elsewhere and I am taking you elsewhere.Who is saying this? The one who started 2019 by advocating a modern executive state and ended up heading an executive parastate? The champion of direct assignments? The champion of corruption? The champion of temporary employees paid for by your taxes?
