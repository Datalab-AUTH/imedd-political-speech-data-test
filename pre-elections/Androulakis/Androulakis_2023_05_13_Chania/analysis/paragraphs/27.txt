A new generation, not 150 â‚¬ of course, but 150,000 social houses for young couples to start their lives with dignity. We will not make all of Greece a short-term rental, nor a huge hotel. We have a duty to open up to houses with zero ENVAT with incentives for reconstruction and of course the Recovery Fund construction of new buildings. To get our children in with social criteria and when their living conditions get better they can leave and others can come in. What is Mr Mitsotakis doing making the citizen a customer? Low interest loans to buy new homes. Only because of the increase in the cost per square metre very few Greek children can take advantage of Mr Mitsotakis' calculations what he says is only happening here what PASOK says is happening here; it happened in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Italy, Germany, Austria and it is the best method to bring down the cost of living for Greek youth and not to have them leave abroad to find a better future.
