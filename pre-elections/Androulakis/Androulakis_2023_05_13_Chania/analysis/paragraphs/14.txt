Friends. We have a duty to talk about the great insult here today from Chania of Mr. Skertzos. Mostly Skertchos said that the question of German reparations,
belongs to the past. So here from Crete, our people, the heroic people, full with their blood, the atrocities of the Nazis in Kontomari, Candano, Viannos, Anogia, Distomo, the rest of Greece, Kalavryta. We must send a message to the arrogance and contempt for the struggles and sacrifices of the Greek people, where, as Mr Mitsotakis' closest associate, he insulted in a way that was unthinkable. Historically, he has tried to create the feeling that we are forgetting our heroes, our struggles, the patriotic struggles of the Greek people. They do not fit. You can see in Mr. Skertzos' paintings and in his exposes the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis in Greece. That is why, therefore, the past in the memory of the Greek people will not be the atrocities of the Nazis, but already Mr Mitsotakis and his company on 21 May.
