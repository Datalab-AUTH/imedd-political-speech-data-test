Friends, I hear the communication arms of Mr Tsipras talking about the blackmailed and the taken. As soon as there was a question of morality the next day, the one who had insulted the Greek people was off our ballot papers. The most sinopic unwise and the blackmailer is the one whose best friend was convicted 13-0, a the special court and instead of sending it home, has him adorn the ballot papers of SYRIZA to call a spade a spade.
