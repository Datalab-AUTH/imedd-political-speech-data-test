Both Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipras think that they will redeem the conscience of the Greek people with a plethora of benefits, but the people have a memory of the 2015 mockery and the 2019 mockery, and they have the impression that they will do so.

All they can achieve is to trivialise the political life of the country.
