Health I can't not mention the biggest political child of PASOK. The one founded by George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos, the National Health System. And I can't not mention not only because in Chania there are huge issues and problems. But also for another reason. Third in private health care spending are Greeks in all of Europe. The people who have some of the lowest wages in Europe pay the third most private health care costs in Europe, surpassed only by Bulgaria and Lithuania. This is the downfall of the NHS under the stamp of Mr Mitsotakis.
