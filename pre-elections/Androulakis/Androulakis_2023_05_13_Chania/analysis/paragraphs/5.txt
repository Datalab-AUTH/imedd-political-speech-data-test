Friends. But who is the real opponent of New Democracy? Tomorrow the Prime Minister will be interviewed in a Sunday newspaper, showing his real obsession and his real agony. His anguish is only one, that the democratic party for PASOK should not be reborn, because he knows very well who the opponent of New Democracy is, and he also knows very well that if Tsipras had not been the official opposition, his government would already be a thing of the past under the weight of the scandals of the last few months. The only thing keeping him standing is the opposition of SYRIZA opposition without ballast. On the one hand local currencies, on the other hand theories about Evros that legitimize Erdogan's hybrid children and, of course, finally, the imitation of Andreas Papandreou. Andreas Papandreou and Aegean Prespes do not go together, Mr Tsipras.
Andreas Papandreou and the sea without borders do not go together, Mr Tsipras, because PASOK was democratic and is a democratic and patriotic movement and does not play with our national issues.
