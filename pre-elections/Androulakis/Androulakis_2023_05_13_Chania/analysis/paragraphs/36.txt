Friends. But history is not only to remember, it is also to compare, to compare who has contributed and who has harmed. We then. In the face of these great changes that our country needs, we say remember what happened in 2010. More recently of these great changes, because I hear some people say that the new democracy and Mitsotakis was, he says always on the right side of history. And so I say here from Chania, if in 2010. PASOK MPs had followed the vote of Tsipras and Mitsotakis. Greece today was in the euro or in the drachma and if Mr. Mitsotakis does not remember, let him ask his sister who voted against him so that the country does not go to the drachma can not play with the memory and intelligence of the Greek people. The Greek people are not lotus eaters, Mr Mitsotakis, and they remember both the zappias and the anti-memoranda. And of the mockery to get the chair of power. Only the democratic party was in the right position of power. Only the one who lifted the patriotic burden and did not let the country become Argentina to lead to an incredible bankruptcy.
