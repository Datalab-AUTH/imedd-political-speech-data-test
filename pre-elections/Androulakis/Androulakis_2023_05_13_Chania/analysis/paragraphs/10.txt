Friends. A strong PASOK is an obstacle and a mound. The sun will rise, with the struggles, with the efforts of all of us. All of us together proudly raise the sun of PASOK, the flag of the democratic party. Friends. On 21 May, we have a duty to put up a barrier to populism and to clientelistic elitism. The deterioration of our political culture cannot continue. The discounting of democratic values or the erosion of constitutional institutions, the trivialisation of parliamentary morals, the devaluation of our intelligence. We have a duty to support people and parties that invest in progress, in reason, in reason, in reason, in respect for the man of the land and the environment. To offer new models away from buffoonery away from clientelistic philosophies, away from playing games with the domestic elite and the domestic oligarchy and I pledge here from Chania that we will confront any powerful undermining the public interest and the perspective of the Greek people. We have a duty to ensure dignity and perspective.
