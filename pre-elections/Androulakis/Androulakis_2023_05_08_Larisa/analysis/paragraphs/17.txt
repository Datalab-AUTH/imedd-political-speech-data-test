Friends. We have a duty to revive one of the greatest children of PASOK. The national health care system is collapsing. The Greek people pay the third highest private health care costs in Europe. We are third after Lithuania and Bulgaria and with very low wages. Do you know? Mr Mitsotakis gave an interview the other day and said that our health is doing very well. On the same day, Mrs Gaga issued a circular saying that we are not covering on-call duties, so come and let us cover on-call duties from other specialities because there is not enough staff. On the same day. And of course Mrs. Ganga withdrew the circular not because the problem was solved, but because she didn't want to crush Mr. Mitsotakis' narrative.
