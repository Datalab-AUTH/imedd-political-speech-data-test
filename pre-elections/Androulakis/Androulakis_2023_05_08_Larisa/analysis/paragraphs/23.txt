Friends, in closing, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this. Today's demonstration sends a clear message of victory here in Larissa and throughout Greece. I therefore call upon every Greek, together with every Greek, to make change possible on May 21, together, to rebuild together the Greece of social justice and national dignity. Friends. 15 days left, only 15 days. Take the cause of the party's rebirth into your own hands. All together from tomorrow in every village, in every workplace, in every city. 21 May, a great victory, a great change, a strong PASOK and you can be sure that we will put back into the dustbin of history the toxicity, populism and elitism that condemns the Greek people and does not allow them to have better days of perspective and hope. All together for the new Greece of the future. Be well and have a good race. Raise the flags of the green sun with pride. Remember the struggles, the historic struggles of Andreas Papandreou. Remember the struggles of all generations and it is a great honour for me to look at the fighters, democrats and progressives of all generations of the PASOK renaissance here today in front of the ancient theatre of Larissa. Bless you and have a good fight. Victory is near. All together, let's go strong. Fight, fight, fight, fight.
