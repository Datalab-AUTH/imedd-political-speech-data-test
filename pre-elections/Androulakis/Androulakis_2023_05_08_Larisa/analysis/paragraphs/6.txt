So what am I saying here from Larissa, but I don't hear them answering in public? I hope they will answer in the debate. I can promise you, if we are in government, that in two months' time you will not see any more party boys, but there will be an open international competition with high financial incentives for the best Greeks to come and serve our hospitals and public organisations. You cannot manage millions of euros and get â‚¬1700. You cannot manage millions of euros and be the best friend of Mitsotakis' nephew or the best friend of Mr Pappas. We have to make a normal European country and that is the vision of PASOK, the vision of the democratic party. A state, not a booty in the hands of the Prime Minister of the day, but a state that guarantees the public interest and respects the taxes of the Greek people.
