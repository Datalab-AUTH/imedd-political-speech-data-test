Friends, we owe it to each region to set up at least one agricultural park with subsidised infrastructure and to create a corresponding export body with the participation of cooperatives, businesses and networks. We must strengthen the cooperative schemes that can ensure better financing, better supply of inputs, cooperation with research centres and promotion of quality products on international markets. Agriculture needs to be based on the knowledge of modern times with farmer training and advisory services, the application of innovations in agricultural production and, of course, schools and institutes, agricultural schools to adequately train Greek farmers and their children free of charge. Reduction of taxes and concessions of public land and utilization of new activities for collective production schemes. This is the plan of the democratic party to make our farmers competitive people again who will produce wealth and their children will stay here in the Thessalian plain and in all of Greece. We will not allow the de-fellatinisation of Greek land. We will not allow our villages to have no Greeks, no inhabitants in the years to come.
