Friends, here in Thessaly, I cannot fail to mention the tragedy of Tempi. A tragedy that is engraved in the heart of the Greek people. 57 people lost their lives in a violent and sudden manner. Because our state is not a normal European state that protects the citizen, that has transport with security, transparency in institutions and meritocracy. It is a state that after the tragedy, instead of hearing an apology and justice doing its job, to find out how this disputed stationmaster came to be in this position and we were listening to Mr Georgiades and Mr Voridis telling us that the transfer of the disputed stationmaster was legal, and a week ago the committee appointed by Mitsotakis himself, the three-member committee, came out and said that the transfer of the stationmaster was illegal because he had exceeded the age limit. Have you heard any apologies from Georgiades and Voridis? Why has SYRIZA stopped talking about the tragedy of Tempi? Because quite simply, on 21 October 2021, in Mr Karamanlis' drawer there was a conclusion from the transparency authority that we submitted to Parliament during the controversial procedure. What did that report say? That since 2014, 9 years, certain persons in the Ministry and in the OSE did not allow telecommanding when the Contract said that it had to be completed in 2 years and even when all the 55 million euros of the project were all European money and not even 1 euro of tax of the Greek people. So what did justice do? It never got hold of the conclusion and when we asked Mr Karamanlis why the judiciary had not got hold of the conclusion, he replied boldly that even he did not know of the existence of the conclusion that the transparency authority had submitted to his Ministry. Well, this is the Greece we need to change, the Greece of the client state and of widespread corruption and contempt for the public interest.
