Friends, why do I call them unrepentant? Because we have organizations, hospitals that for many decades, except for a short period of our own government in 2010 with open gov, as soon as the elections are over, failed politicians, old MPs, old cronies of Maximos, take over the positions of governors, organizations and hospitals.
