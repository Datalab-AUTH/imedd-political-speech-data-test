Friends. I cannot close without commenting. PASOK is everywhere, but it will go everywhere in the next 15 days from all of you. From you I expect you to take the struggle and the agony of our people into your hands. Together, each and every one of you individually to take the word of progress, the word of dignity, the word of change close to the citizen. Friends, in closing, I want you to think about what we are historically, why we are the democratic party? I am not saying that there are no democrats and people who are fighters in other parties. For God's sake, we are not arrogant. But this party is the democratic party because since its foundation and I am not only talking about Andreas Papandreou. I am talking about the pioneer, the first founder, Eleftherios Venizelos. From Eleftherios Venizelos to Andreas Papandreou, a century of a democratic party, fighting for human rights, for democracy, for democracy, for the rule of law, for the people, and always standing up to the domestic elites against the foreign powers that have been attacking our national interests. So this party with its deep historical social roots and now, just before the elections, has shown its true character, its true values.
