These parties have bad habits. Mr Mitsotakis has brought back the habits of his dad, the habits of the eavesdropping state. Then, Mavrikis, now the nephew. And of course, the nephew who was completely covered up from his responsibilities for the wiretapping state. Do they respect justice? In what other European country would we have such a scandal, that they are watching me, the heads of the armed forces, his own ministers, and I note this because I hear some people saying but Mr Mitsotakis wants you to co-govern and I answer them here from Larissa. Here, Mr Mitsotakis cannot co-govern with his own party; will he co-govern with the PASOK party of principles and values?
