Friends. Justice. Justice is the great issue for our people. In every company, in every conversation there is desperation for justice. It has been ingrained in people from all corners of the country that justice does not exist and does not work. That no matter what the powerful do and while powerful and financially and politically powerful they will never pay and take their responsibilities while the people have no chance. So I want to say to you here from Larissa that we have a duty to build a new relationship of trust with the Greek people, and how is this relationship being built? When you respect justice, when you respect people, when you speak the language of truth and do not disregard their logic. So I want to tell you that there is no chance of me betraying any of you, because every day the relationship of honesty that I am building with the Greek people is getting stronger. I could not imagine my closest associate being convicted 13-0 by the Special Court, like Mr Pappas, Mr Tsipras' best friend, and instead of sending him home I would have him on the PASOK ballot papers. I could not imagine a close relative of mine being a protagonist in this corruption, like Mr Mitsotakis' nephew, and not being brought to justice. This is not a normal European country. I pledge to you that just as PASOK built the Greece of the 20th century, the Greece that demolished the post-civil war state, I pledge to you that together with all of you we will build the European country of the future, the strong Greece for all Greeks. In this party there will be no Patsy's in this party who will take the loans of the Greek people, disregarding their interests. In this party no corruption will ever again be tolerated. Together we will change the country, together we will change all the bad things and we have a duty to confront all the powerful interests that do not allow our country and the new generation to stand on its feet.
