Friends, I can't help but say that it was unthinkable in the Recovery Fund that there are no projects for strong rail lines, when the only green means in Europe that helps the green low-cost energy transition is the train, and instead of giving billions to make an extensive rail network, we cannot ensure the basics for Greek citizens. So that is why I pledge that we will look at everything. And above all, the unacceptable privatisation that Mr Tsipras called a sell-out at â‚¬300 and brazenly sold 45 million euros of TRAINOSE. And of course he gave a dowry of 250 million for the barren lines. We need to evaluate. Was this privatisation right? We propose a new strategic investor and again after privatisation, but to companies that have experience and not the companies that even in Italy cannot serve the people with better services.
