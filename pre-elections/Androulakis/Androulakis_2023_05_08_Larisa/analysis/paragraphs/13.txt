Friends, as I said before, for us demography is the great national issue. But it is not solved by benefits that do not even arrive in the first week of the month. We are providing comprehensive solutions of a strong welfare state. For young couples, the priority is to bring down the cost of living. What are the inelastic costs? First, rent. Rents have been galloping in recent years. So we propose to do what is happening in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Italy, Germany and Austria. That is, to have a pool of social housing, either newly built from the Recovery Fund, or with tax and reconstruction criteria with zero ENVAT to be included in the pool and rented for 15 years at a very low rent to your children and grandchildren to have families. This is a programme that does not create citizen-customers, like Mr Mitsotakis's programme, where very few people can take advantage of low-interest loans, but it is a programme that is used by 150,000 families and at the same time, through competition, it brings down rents overall in all the urban centres of the country.
