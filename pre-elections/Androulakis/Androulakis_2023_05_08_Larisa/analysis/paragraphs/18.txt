So we come to solve the issue of the NHS. How? But the Recovery Fund was not for many reasons, it was for health, the green transition, digital convergence. Those were the priorities of the Recovery Fund that was done because of the pandemic. Europe gave 32 billion to Greece because of the pandemic. Of the 32, 21 of them were subsidies. What did the other countries do? It's not just the Greek public health system that has a problem. The Portuguese gave 8%, the Italians 11%, we gave 2% for services and another 2% for the energy upgrade of buildings. This is Mr Mitsotakis's belief in the public social good of health care, and we will stand in the way of the privatisation of health care that will further impoverish the weakest Greeks. That is why I am committing from the Recovery Fund 8 to 10% of the resources to go to the NHS. Second commitment, strong primary health care throughout Greece, an extensive network in every city, in every village to have services close to the citizen for the citizen, when a country has such issues of an ageing population and of course staffing of the NHS. Financial incentives for all health professionals to keep our doctors in Greece and not to travel to Germany, Belgium and France. And of course, let us end the mockery of heavy and unhealthy work. I pledge after the elections as a government to include all our health workers in the heavy and unhealthy so that they have real solutions and not the applause of the mockery.
