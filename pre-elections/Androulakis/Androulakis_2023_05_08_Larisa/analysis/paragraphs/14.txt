Friends, if Mr Mitsotakis believed this, he could have done it, but he did not. He chose the 150â‚¬ pass before the elections. And you will tell me why he didn't believe them? If he believed them, he would have done what Costa did. 26,000 newly built houses were put by the Portuguese in the Recovery Fund, 20,000 by the Spanish, 11,000 by the Italians and Mr Mitsotakis giving the 150 euro pass, 70 houses in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. This is contempt for the youth of our country.
