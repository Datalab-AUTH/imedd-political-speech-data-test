this party? This democratic movement, PASOK. It has always handled national issues with realism and patriotism, without grand talk. That is why I call on the Greeks to trust us on national issues as well. This is the party that put Cyprus in the European Union with the Cyprus problem unresolved. This is the party that created the Helsinki Strategy, which Karamanlis discredited.
