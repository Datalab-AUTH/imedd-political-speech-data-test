Support for farmers, farmers, farmers, farmers' cooperatives with priority to renewable energy parks, so that each one of you knows that through renewable energy sources you will have fixed energy costs for the next 15 years, as is the case in all European countries, and not the green transition to be a business of 5 oligarchs in Greece. We want the green transition with energy justice without energy poverty, with priority for producers. And to the poorest Greeks we want a highly interconnected network, that is what we are saying.
