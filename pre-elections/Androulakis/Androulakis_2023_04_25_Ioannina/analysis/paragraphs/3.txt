The conclusion of the Commission on the tragedy of Tempi. The commission appointed by himself states that the transfer of the fatal stationmaster was illegal. What does Mr Mitsotakis have to say to his ministers, Mr Voridis and Mr Georgiades, who, after the death of 57 people, told all the channels that the transfer was legal? Who, after all, is responsible for this party buffoonery of New Democracy? Not PASOK, as they wanted to present themselves at that time, not even respecting the families of the victims. Mr Mitsotakis is interested. The citizen should know the truth. But he keeps Mr Karamanlis on his ballot papers. The head of the ministry who arrived in his office in October 2021. The Transparency Authority's finding that pointed to those responsible for both the SYRIZA era and the New Democracy era that delayed the implementation of the 717 contract, which if implemented would have been telecommunications and we would have avoided this tragedy. Mr Tsipras does not say anything about this finding of the Transparency Authority either.
