Friends, education. For us, education is the greatest lever of social justice and social mobility. Do you know all too well the older people? That public education made the child of the farmer in the Epirus of the cattle farmer study in the good years of the PASOK. Doctor, lawyer engineer, to produce wealth and build his family with dignity. We have a duty to strengthen all levels of public education again, so that all Greek children have free access to reduce inequalities and not Greek children taking computer tests by looking into the pocket of their grandfather's, grandmother's father and mother. But looking at their future and their ambitions for it, so for us the vision for public education is a priority. Schools today must be a key instrument for young people to respond to the digital world and sustainable development, offering equal opportunities to all young people, breaking down inequalities, setting them up to take on the challenges of the future both as citizens and as workers. For this there must be a strong public school and a strong public university. We know that the ideological policies of SYRIZA and, of course, the policies of New Democracy, which want to privatise education at all levels, have degraded and undermined education in our country. That is why it is time to take bold decisions. Always in cooperation with teachers, with an increase in public spending on education, so that we can gradually reach the average spending of the European Union countries, our proposals focus on strengthening quality by modernising content and implementing the 16 quality indicators of the European Union, with remedial teaching programmes to cover learning gaps and address inequalities by using modern digital capabilities, which unfortunately do not exist.
