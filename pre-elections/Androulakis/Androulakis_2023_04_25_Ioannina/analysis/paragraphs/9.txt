Friends. We must understand that on May 21, voting for PASOK, only PASOK comes out. And what our political opponents are saying - Mr Mitsotakis saying that you vote PASOK and you get SYRIZA and Mr Tsipras saying that you vote PASOK and you get New Democracy - shows their terror and their anxiety for the rebirth of the democratic party, for the great mass participation of democratic citizens here in Ioannina as well.
