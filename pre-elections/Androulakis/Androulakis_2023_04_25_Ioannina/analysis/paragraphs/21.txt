The Recovery Fund to finance the energy grid across Greece, so that municipalities can make communities energy efficient. Farmers, ranchers, energy price stability. I am very much afraid that costs will rise and what happened last year will happen. The tariff will be reduced from our taxes and from our taxes they will make billions in subsidies. Those who are being coddled by the media, by Mr Mitsotakis, we have a duty to stand in the way of this injustice that is being done at the expense of the production of Greece, of the country.
