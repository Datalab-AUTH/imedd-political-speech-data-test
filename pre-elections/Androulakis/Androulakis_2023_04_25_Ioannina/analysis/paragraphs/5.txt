The prime minister is a liberal. Who has all the orphans of Mr. Karatzaferis in his crucial ministries of government. Or is the Prime Minister a liberal and centrist when he has brought Karatzaferis himself to attack me daily from the channels? Is the Prime Minister liberal, who banned the European institutions a few weeks ago from meeting with his ministers. Or is he a liberal prime minister who is responsible for the scandal of the state's eavesdropping scandal and who went so far as to justify it by presenting the leader of PASOK as a force as an agent of foreign powers? Mr Mitsotakis must understand that these are out of the worst times of the right-wing, the times when Andreas Papandreou's PASOK was consigned to the dustbin of history. I understand his panic, I understand that he does not see the very large PASOK rallies, and a moment ago he said that he said I was hiding.
