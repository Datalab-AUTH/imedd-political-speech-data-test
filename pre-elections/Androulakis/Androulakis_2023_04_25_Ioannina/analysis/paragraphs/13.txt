The second issue is the management of private debt. For us, the second chance of dignity for all Greeks who fought and struggled objectively but could not endure the conditions of multiple crises is a priority. We do not say with the dry and the green, as Mr Tsipras did when he said in 2012, 2013, 2014 seismic and do not pay. We come for own arrangements and handed over your toil and sacrifices to the blackmailers of foreign funds.
We therefore propose against Mr Mitsotakis who completely abolished the protection of the first home in the restoration of the protection of the main house for over-indebted households, by updating the PASOK law of 2010.
