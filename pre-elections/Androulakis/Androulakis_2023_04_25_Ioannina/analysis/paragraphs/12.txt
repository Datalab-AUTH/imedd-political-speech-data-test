With a strong PASOK, I pledge to every Greek to create a social housing pool of 150,000 houses throughout Greece, newly built or with Recovery Fund funds or rebuilt with apologies, with tax incentives and relief for their owners. I am talking about closed houses with a view to making them available at cheap rent so that young couples and the poorest Greeks can have decent access. This is how we achieve competition to drive down rents. Because today one of the biggest cost of living systems every day is the cost of rent.
