Friends, on the other hand, Mr.Tsipras is obsessed with proclaiming himself as the representative of progress in Greece. Is it progress? Following the example of Mr Mitsotakis, not having issued a press release and not having said an apology for Andreas Georgiou, who was targeted by him and the Right as being responsible for the memoranda, when only Mr Karamanlis and his government were responsible. Mr Georgiou was vindicated in the European courts, but you know, it is not a good sign for democracy, for the rule of law in our country and for me and other people to resort to the Court of Human Rights to find justice in Greece in 2023. That is why PASOK has a great duty to play an important role in strengthening democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Is it progress, Mr Tsipras, that you have been cooperating closely with Mr Kamenos, or is it progress that you have put dozens of Kamenos' members on your ballot papers, and recently also recently? The press spokesman of the bankrupt government of Mr Karamanlis? Well, with all these executives, that is not the Left. This is a conglomerate for power and the chair.
