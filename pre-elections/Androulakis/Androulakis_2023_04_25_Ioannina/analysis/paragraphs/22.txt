Friends. Universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation, we have a duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinization of the Greek economy. Establishment of an end to the confiscation and tax-free status of subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers and, of course, updating the ELGA insurance regulation by extending the coverage of disasters to livestock due to climate change - the Ministry probably does not know what climate change means. And what huge problems it will create in the future and does not modernise the mechanism and the ELGA insurance regulation. Finally, the whole process for the new CAP programmes must be completed exactly within one year without bureaucracy. No more hassle for thousands of farmers and stockbreeders, specific dates for the submission of applications, evaluation and payment.
