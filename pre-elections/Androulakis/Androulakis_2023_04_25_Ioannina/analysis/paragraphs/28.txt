I expect a lot from each and every one of you individually for this. Take in your hands the struggle of PASOK, the struggle of the democratic party from tomorrow morning, in every village of Epirus, in every town, in every workplace, struggle, struggle, struggle until the great victory that will bring PASOK and Mr. Mitsotakis and Mr. Tsipras to the forefront. With the unjust divisive policies that undermine our country in the dustbin of history, good strength and good fight. So here from Ioannina from the heart of Epirus we all together send a message of victory to all democrats, progressive Greeks. Be well and have a good fight. PASOK is here, united and strong, and I invite our candidates to come here, to join hands together for the great victory, together for the common struggle.
