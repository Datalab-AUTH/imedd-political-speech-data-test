With PASOK strong and I say this. Because for us the national health system is a top issue today, as today its initiator, one of his great comrades, George Gennimatas, who, together with Andreas Papandreou and Paraskevas Avgerinos, left this very great social legacy to the Greek people, has passed away. So we are talking about the rebirth of the national health system. Which needs support, so we are proposing an adjustment so that the Recovery Fund can finance the NHS with 8 to 10%, which are percentages similar to countries that have the same problems as Greece and not the 2-4% that New Democracy has given. Also, strong primary health care that reaches every home in every case. It requires staffing the hospitals of the national health system with permanent medical staff and, as we must not only give applause and clapping, but also an increase in the salaries of the health workers of the national health system, so that we can bring us into line with the average of doctors and health workers with the other countries of the European Union. Introduce social, economic and scientific incentives to stop the understaffing of hospitals in the region. You are well aware of the problem here in Epirus too. Finally, on the heavy and unhealthy pay of NHS health workers and no more selective increases in allowances.
