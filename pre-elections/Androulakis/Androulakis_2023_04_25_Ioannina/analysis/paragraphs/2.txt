It proves that the democratic party, the historic movement founded by Andreas Papandreou, has once again become a leading player in the political scene of the country. A short while ago, Mr Mitsotakis. Giving an interview to a television channel, he said that I have a personal problem with him. The question, Mr Mitsotakis, is not whether I have a personal problem with you. The issue for you is that, ahead of 21 May, millions of Greeks have a personal problem with your policies. For Mr Mitsotakis. And his communications staff every day of the campaign is April Fools' Day. In all my interviews and mine and all our staff. We have made it clear that there is no scenario of a coalition with Mr Varoufakis' party. and those who played the country in the dice of the drachma. But Mr Mitsotakis. He continues to be terrified to bring up this scenario. So we give him today from the heart of Epirus from Ioannina Oscar fiction of Mr. Mitsotakis deserves this Oscar, because every day he bombards the Greek people with lies and fake news. There is no other way to explain his obsession with lies, so I would suggest that he should leave the conspiracy theories behind and answer some of the questions that the Greek citizen discusses every day.
