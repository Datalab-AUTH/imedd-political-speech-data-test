Friends. In closing I cannot fail to mention. The challenges we had today from Turkey. Many people say that we are waiting in our country for the Turkish elections to be completed and for the environment for discussions with Turkey to change. Indeed, Mr Tsipras, the visionary, says. To make the Aegean Prespes. Mr Mitsotakis is hiding from the real problems. They meet both European leaders, but never once did they talk about an arms embargo on Turkey, which even today Erdogan had spot putting within the Turkish Charter the Northeast Aegean and Western Thrace. It is therefore incumbent on both the Europeans and the Americans, if Kilitzaroglu and Erdogan continue their provocations, the violation of our sovereign rights and the undermining of good neighbourly relations, to stop selling even one bullet to Turkey, because otherwise they are Pontius Pilates. and accomplices of provocations against Cyprus and Greece.
