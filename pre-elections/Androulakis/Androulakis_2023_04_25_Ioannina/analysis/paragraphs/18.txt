Friends, I cannot but report here from Epirus. Which is the heart of productive Greece along with Thessaly in the issue of agri-food. From Trikala the day before yesterday I spoke about a new price contract. With the Greek farmer and the Greek farmer. We used to say that blood is not water. That is why every farmer and every farmer's wife must remember. Which is the party that gave them dignity in the 80s and 90s. Only PASOK has proved that it can provide redemptive solutions to the sharp rise in production costs and the precariousness faced by the farming and livestock farming world. Here in Epirus, you are well aware that the livestock sector has been in dramatic decline over the last three years, both in terms of the number of producers and, of course, in terms of the quantities of milk in the region. It is typical that in 2020 the production and sheep's milk units in Epirus. They have declined significantly in just one year, 500 producers have left the profession, while milk volumes have fallen by tens of tens of 10,000 tonnes.
