Friends. But what monstrosity? There is a worse monstrosity than the lack of respect for the ordinary citizen. There is a worse monstrosity than exposing your country internationally. Like Mr Tsipras in the referendum of 15 made a mockery of our country worldwide by turning the no yes vote into a no yes in a matter of minutes. So Mr Mitsotakis a few days ago, when European institutions came to Greece to meet the government, he closed the door on them as countries do. Press Hungary. So they, with their decisions, with their attitudes, are leading the country to monstrosity and special exceptionalism. We are fighting for a country and a proud people, a European normal country with respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy. We are not fighting for the country of the cover-up of the wiretapping for the country, the cover-up of the TV licence game. You will not see next to me anyone convicted 13-0 by a special court who we have on our ballot papers, such as Mr Pappas; you will not see on the ballot papers of the democratic party anyone who has insulted the intelligence of the Greek people and the public interest. But on the other hand.
