And I want to say that in these difficult days when this election campaign started. Some people are again trying to raise false dilemmas. But what is the real dilemma of the election? It is egoism. Of Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis. Who cannot appreciate that what they have done over the last eight and a half years has led Greece to continue the merry-go-round of lost opportunities. The toxicity, the division. So what is the real dilemma? Is the real dilemma or do we as a nation as a people build a state that guarantees the public interest and security? Or do we continue the game in which the rulers of the day will have the state as a booty in their hands with the sole aim of buffoonery and strengthening their power? We, then, get in the way. To those who have bankrupted Greece. To the attitudes that are driving the young generation abroad. The practices that make citizens disillusioned. But now the people cannot say that they did not know as they did in 2014. Now we know very well what Mr Tsipras and Mr Kammenos were, and what Mr Mitsotakis was? They have been tested. So today, does Mr Mitsotakis think he can hide his executive failure? The grave insult to the institutions, the widening of social inequalities, the reduction in the purchasing power of citizens and job insecurity does not call for a positive vote for the work he is doing. He goes all over Greece and spreads the scarecrow of Mr Tsipras' governance and says. Vote for me because they will come.
