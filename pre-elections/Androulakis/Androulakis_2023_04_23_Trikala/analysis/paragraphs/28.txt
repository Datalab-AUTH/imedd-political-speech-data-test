Our aim is to give prospects to our production and of course to create conditions of location in each region and subsidise the infrastructure of at least one agricultural park and create a corresponding export body. Agriculture based on knowledge, modernisation and change, the creation of agricultural schools to train young farmers in modern production needs and incentives for the employment of young people in agricultural production, tax reductions and concessions of public land and its use for new activities and collective producers, all of this. Make your children and grandchildren stay in Thessaly and be able to produce with dignity like you How are we going to deal with the demographic, if apart from the welfare state that we envision, there are no good jobs in all sectors of the economy and especially in the primary sector and manufacturing.
