We are here to prevent any such scenario, because the goal of the democratic party is the interest of the many and not the few that the government of New Democracy serves today. We are being asked what we will do post-election, who we will go with and who we will leave. We answer clearly. We will go with the unemployed young person looking for prospects, with our fellow citizens who spend 50% of their income on housing costs, with the part-time worker of â‚¬400 and
with the pensioner who has had his ESAS cut by Mr Tsipras and cannot earn a month after the fortnight and for this pensioner we are committed to a new ESAS for 350,000 low pensioners.
