From the domestic oligarchy. I expect a lot from all of you, from all Greeks, from all Greek women who want a better future for themselves and their children. So let us join our forces, unite our struggles, unite our hopes and make PASOK the leading actor of the great democratic struggles again. The message is clear, a strong PASOK means a new victory. New change, new hope, new perspective, new perspective, a decision for change with Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipa in the dustbin of history, a decision for change, a decision for brave reforms, brave changes that will bring social justice and national dignity, be well and good luck to us in this fight. The mass gathering from Thessaly shows that PASOK is strong and no matter how much we are beaten we will become even stronger. So let's fight together, fight together, fight together and be well. Our parliamentary candidates from all over Thessaly to come up. Raise the flags of PASOK in the days of social justice, in the days of national dignity. Together we will fight the fight and together on May 21 we will be victorious, bless you.
