Friends. I am personally committed to a strong PASOK. That the priority in our negotiations will be the reservoir of 150,000 social housing places, either newly built with Recovery Fund money, as is the case in Spain, Portugal and Italy, or with tax incentives, or incentives for reconstruction in all municipalities of the country. There are hundreds of closed houses at the same time. That your student children in Athens and Thessaloniki cannot find a cheap house, low rent and decent housing and are now doing their applications not on the basis of their ambitions, but on the basis of their pocketbook, grandparents' grandparents and families with 150,000 social housing units, we are giving power to young couples in students so that they can make choices of dignity and not choices of begging.
Come together to create a safety net to protect people from private debt. I have said in my previous speeches 120 instalments for the tax office and the National Social Insurance Fund and, of course, when you keep to your arrangement, there can be a reduction in the final amount.
