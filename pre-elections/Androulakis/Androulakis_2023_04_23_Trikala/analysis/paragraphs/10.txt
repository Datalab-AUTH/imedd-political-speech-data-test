I have not heard either Mr Mitsotakis or Mr Tsipras answer, because they derive their power from the client state and not from meritocracy and transparency. Friends. But which state is the state? The one that some people said in 2014 in Thessaly and throughout Greece that you should not pay your loans. Because we are coming with Kammenos and to be fair, we were not told with Kammenos. Then they had the kinder surprise. And they were saying, don't pay seismicity, we are coming and you won't pay anything seismicity on red loans and after a year of deceiving the Greek people, Mr. Tsipras passes a law and hands over billions of red loans of farmers, farmers, farmers, cooperatives, small and medium enterprises to the crows of the funds. So we as a patriotic movement have only one goal. To put the plan to de-fund the Greek economy on the sidelines and protect all Greeks so that they have a second chance of dignity and can settle their loans in a fair way. We are not saying that the strategic defaulters should be burned with the dry and the green, but the people who are being blackmailed by the funds that took the loans at 5, 10, 15% of the value.
