Friends. So this is where we must have commitments. So I pledge that if the people honour us. We will make a new contract of honour with the farmer and the peasant of our country, because as an old advertisement of ours before the '93 elections said, blood is not water. Does the rural people of the country know well which party it was that gave them substance, strength and dignity? So immediate implementation to support our producers, reduction of production costs especially for agricultural inputs, fuel, zero excise duty on agricultural oil for the entire duration of the crisis, with support for energy communities among farmers and production of energy from renewable sources, universal protection of agricultural land from seizures, establishment of the unconfiscated tax-free subsidies and compensation, aid to farmers. Updating the ELGA insurance regulation by extending coverage of livestock disaster coverage due to climate change, something the ministry pretends not to know. The whole process for the new CAP programmes to be completed within a year with specific dates for submission of evaluation applications and payments, enough of the hassle of bureaucracy. Abolish the runner-up beneficiary policy through proper planning of resources and not wasteful provision for decent housing, language learning for foreign farm workers with programs that will make them stay in our country so that we do not have to face what has been happening for the last year and a half that is creating a huge problem in the harvest and production.
Friends. But beyond that, we need a long-term vision for the primary sector. Which has as a priority the increase of the amounts available from the Recovery Fund for the green digital transformation of production and through organic crops and farms. Strengthening the competitiveness and extroversion of our key national products.
