I say everywhere can not tourism. It should be a field of development that only concerns hotels, not the whole of Greece. If we become a vast hotel, all of Greece wins. If we link tourism with the primary sector and manufacturing, so that those 20 million people who come to our country can taste domestic products and ask for them in the supermarkets of their home countries during the rest of the year. Friends. It is our duty to support our cooperatives, to organise new networks, to ensure better financing, supply of supplies, research centres, promotion of quality products in international markets, creating the "Made in Greece" brand. Hundreds of Greek PDO and non PDO products must be on the shelves of supermarkets around the world in the coming years.
