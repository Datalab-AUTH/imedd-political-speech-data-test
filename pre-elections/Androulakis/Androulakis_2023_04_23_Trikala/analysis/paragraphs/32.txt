But what is liberalism? In democracy. In rights. Why does everything that has been happening in the last few days remind me of what happened last summer? The liberal and rights activist, Mr Mitsotakis. When he discovered. That I had been sent by the parastate that Predator that I was being followed by the NIS, of which he is the prefect. He said he said a half apology. And at the same time. Hundreds of his executives all over the country. Thousands of New Democracy trolls were saying well, we made him for why he is an agent of foreign powers these practices of the right we haven't seen for half a century and we have a duty to send them with Mitsotakis to the dustbin of history. So have you seen how similar they are? So have you seen how similar their practices are? They are playing nice themselves and their digital parastatals underneath are deconstructing human dignity whenever they need to in order to support their adventurism.
