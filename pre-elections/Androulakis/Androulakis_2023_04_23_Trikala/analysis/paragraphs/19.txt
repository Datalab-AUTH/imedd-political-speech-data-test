We will go with the unemployed young man looking for a perspective, with our fellow citizen who spends 50% of his income on housing costs, with the part-time worker of 400 â‚¬ and with the pensioner who has been cut off from the EKAS by Mr.Tsipras and cannot earn a month after the fortnight and for this pensioner we are committed to a new EKAS for 350,000 low pensioners. We'll go with the one who took a mortgage for their main house and now their mortgage has doubled with the small and medium-sized entrepreneur whose bank door remains closed, at the same time as Europe from the Recovery Fund gave 11 billion to support these people who can't get liquidity in the banking system.The new republic gave the first 1.1 billion at 1.2 interest to 67 strong businesses. Without not getting a drachma small and medium-sized enterprise. So that is why we are asking for the redirection of the Recovery Fund loans.
