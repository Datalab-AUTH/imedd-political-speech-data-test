I've never seen it before. Prime Minister. Bringing in the simple proportional representation and then saying he doesn't use the simple proportional representation. If I'm not first, so how does simple proportional representation work? Do you know what all this shows? Their opportunism. In the face of Mitsotakis remaining Prime Minister and Tsipras becoming Prime Minister again, they are not interested in progress or stability. Our priority, therefore, from the first Sunday, is progress and stability, solutions, a programme, positions and a new political ethos.
