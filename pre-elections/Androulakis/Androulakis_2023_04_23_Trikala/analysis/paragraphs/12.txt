They are the ones today who are caressing Mr Mitsotakis and whose media did not say a word yesterday about the conclusion of the tragedy of Tempi. We did not hear them say and apologise yesterday. Mr Voridis and Mr Georgiades, who said that it was not illegal, said that the transfer of this particular official was illegal, but yesterday the conclusion that was reached not by the judiciary but by the committee appointed by Mr Mitsotakis said that this transfer was illegal. We have not heard any apology because all they care about. It is a show a fake reality to keep their likes at the helm of power.
