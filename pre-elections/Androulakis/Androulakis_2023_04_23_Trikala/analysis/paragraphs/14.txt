That is why we call on the Greek people. To take a choice of responsibility. A decision to change. A decision for change that is a clear choice between a state of opacity that exists only to serve the blue children and a state of meritocracy, transparency and respect for institutions. They say we have no seats. 15 days ago I said that all political leaders should commit themselves. That if we participate in the next government. All the country's institutions and all the hospitals will have their administrations staffed by open international competitions and not by their party children, as has been the case in recent years. I have not heard either Mr Mitsotakis or Mr Tsipras answer, because they derive their power from the client state and not from meritocracy and transparency. Friends. But which state is the state?
