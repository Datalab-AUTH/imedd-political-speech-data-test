And PASOK. How will it use the vote of the Greek people? They ask us again. We do not prejudge the will of the Greek people. We do not set up coalitions on the sidelines and behind the scenes we do not say, like Mr Mitsotakis, that the first Sunday does not count and we will hold more elections until he becomes prime minister. We are not talking about a government of either winners or losers.
