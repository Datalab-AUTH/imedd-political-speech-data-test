So we come today in 2023, so that we don't cry at 30, we say take action together, let's learn from everyone's mistakes and not let some people remain unrepentant at the expense of you and your children. Friends. The older generations who remember the good of the democratic party of the patriotic movement of the People's Movement of Andreas Papandreou have a duty to speak to the next generations. Who imagined back then the golden years of the post-independence? That there would be a neo-Nazi party in Greece. In the country that Hitler massacred there is a party that celebrates Nazism and neo-Nazism. That there would be a Holocaust denier party. Who would have thought? That there would be people. In bloody Kalavryta. In Distomo.
