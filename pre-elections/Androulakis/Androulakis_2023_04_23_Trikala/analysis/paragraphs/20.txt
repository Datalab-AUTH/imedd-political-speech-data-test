Protecting the borrower of the 80,000 families of the Swiss franc by limiting to 1/3 their liability for their change, the exchange rate change and 2/3 that the interest rate is borne by the banking institution. Limits on the profitability of funds for viable arrangements to borrowers, as they buy loans at 15 and 20% and sell them at 80 and 90. Substantial negotiation with banks and taking measures to eliminate and prevent increase in interest rates on loans to weak households. And, of course, reduce the banks' profit margins for consistent borrowers. I say this because some will say? But there is no moral hazard. There is a moral hazard. For those who became poor, struggled and couldn't stand it. And because we want to give incentives to those who struggled and endured for this, we are saying special arrangements for them as well, so that all Greeks are in a framework of economic justice and fairness and perspective, and not the banks earning billions from the huge difference between the interest rate on deposits and the interest rate on mortgages. When I proposed all this a year ago, the gentlemen on the right called me a populist. When the banks will make 3 weeks before the elections, it is a gift from the Mitsotakis government so far the mockery of the powerful interests that protect the new democracy.
