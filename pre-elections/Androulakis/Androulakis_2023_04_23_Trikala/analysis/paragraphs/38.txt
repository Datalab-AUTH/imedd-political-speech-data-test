Who would choose this neo-Nazi formation. I want you to remember which party, from the very first moment of the creation of Golden Dawn, did not campaign against it throughout Greece. We never talked about a good Golden Dawn, we never fished in the waters of neo-Nazism and the extreme right. And I want Mr Tsipras to tell us today why he did not pass the law that prevents the participation of Golden Dawn, but I want Mr Mitsotakis to tell us as well. Why this law? He didn't tell us to agree on the condemnation of the criminals who murdered Pavlos Fyssas from the very first moment. Why? Because they were letting them campaign in prison and they were looking at the polls the other way.
