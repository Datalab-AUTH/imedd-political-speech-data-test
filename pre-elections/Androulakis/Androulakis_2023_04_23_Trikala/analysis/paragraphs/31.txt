So I'm scared. That the Left in our Greece. has gone from the left of caviar to the left of carnage. This is not the real left. The left is the one that respects human rights, the rule of law, and all these systems of parastate and digital gangs have nothing to do with it. This left is PASOK and the democratic party.
