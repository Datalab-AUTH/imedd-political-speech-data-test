I am personally committed to a strong PASOK. That the priority in our negotiations will be the reservoir of 150,000 social housing places, either newly built with the Recovery Fund, as is the case in Spain, Portugal, Italy, or with tax incentives, or incentives for reconstruction in all municipalities in the country. There are hundreds of closed houses at the same time. When your children, students in Athens and Thessaloniki, cannot find a cheap house, low rent and decent housing and now do their applications not based on their ambitions, but on their pockets, their grandparents' grandfather and their family with 150,000 social housing units, we give power to young student couples, so that they can make choices of dignity and not of begging.
