Friends. The older generations who remember the good of the democratic party of the patriotic movement of the People's Movement of Andreas Papandreou have a duty to speak to the next generations. Who then imagined the golden years of post-independence? That there would be a neo-Nazi party in Greece. In the country that Hitler massacred, there would be a party that praises Nazism and neo-Nazism. That there would be a Holocaust denier party. Who would have imagined? That there would be people. In bloody Kalavryta. In Distomo. Who would choose this neo-Nazi formation. I want you to remember which party, from the first moment of the creation of Golden Dawn, did not campaign against it throughout Greece. We never talked about a good Golden Dawn, we never fished in the waters of neo-Nazism and the extreme right. And I want Mr Tsipras to tell us today why he did not pass the law that prevents the participation of Golden Dawn, but I want Mr Mitsotakis to say? Why this law? He did not tell us to come together to ensure that the criminals who murdered Pavlos Fyssas are condemned from the very first moment. Why? Because they were letting them campaign in prison and looking at the polls the other way. As long as it seemed that they were not getting into parliament, Mr Mitsotakis was saying. Bigger remainder under 3% easier self-reliance for me when things turned around, he came to tell us to come to an understanding we from the beginning we stood in the way of neo-Nazism, we did not instrumentalize, we did not talk about a good Golden Dawn and every Greek democrat, every Greek liberal should remember this.
