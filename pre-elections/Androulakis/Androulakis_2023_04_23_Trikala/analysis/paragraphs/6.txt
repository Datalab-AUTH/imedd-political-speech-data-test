I say this so that every Greek understands that our basic political difference is that we are going and moving forward, not on the basis of our political interest, but on the basis of the principles and values of a democratic movement of a people, the people-born movement, such as the one that was founded in the good years of 1974, and if we have hurt the Greek people, some people with their practices are not among us. They will not be among us again and we are building a new relationship of trust with all Greek citizens. Therefore, voting for PASOK on May 21 is only PASOK. By voting PASOK we send these 2 systems of power to the past by voting PASOK you vote for the rule of law, a resilient and competitive economy, a cohesive society, fair development and prosperity for all citizens and not only for the likes of the powerful. Today, PASOK on this new page is building relationships of trust every day. So said the great Nikos Kazantzakis. Non-existent is that we did not desire enough. We in PASOK wish enough for a strong and just Greece in Europe and in the world and we will make this non-existent with our struggle in the next 4 weeks real for all Greeks. We keep our best traditions our patriotic DNA our historic struggles for democracy and social justice and the unparalleled work of infrastructure and the rule of law. The welfare state, health and education, the national health system built by George Gennimatas and Paraskevas Avgerinos of Public Education that your children and grandchildren. They were the ones who could for many, many years study in Greek universities, become doctors, lawyers. The child of the farmer, the farmer's child and to achieve more in life than previous generations, we are the party, the progressive, patriotic party of European social democracy.
