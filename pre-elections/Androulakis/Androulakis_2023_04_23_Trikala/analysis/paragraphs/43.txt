But beyond that, a long-term vision for the primary sector is needed. Which has as a priority to increase the amounts available from the Recovery Fund for the green digital transformation of production and through organic crops and farms. Strengthening the competitiveness and extroversion of our key national products. I say everywhere can not tourism. To be a field of development that only concerns hotels, not the whole of Greece. If we become a vast hotel, all of Greece wins. If we link tourism with the primary sector and manufacturing, so that those 20 million people who come to our country can taste domestic products and ask for them in the supermarkets of their home countries during the rest of the months. Friends. We have a duty to support our cooperatives, to organise new networks, to ensure better funding, supply of supplies, research centres, promotion of quality products in international markets, creating the "Made in Greece" brand. Hundreds of Greek PDO and non-PDO products should be on the shelves of supermarkets around the world in the next few years.
