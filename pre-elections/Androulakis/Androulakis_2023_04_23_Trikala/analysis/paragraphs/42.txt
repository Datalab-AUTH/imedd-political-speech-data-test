Therefore, immediate implementation to support our producers, reduction of production costs especially for agricultural supplies, fuel, zero excise tax on agricultural oil for the duration of the crisis, with support for energy communities among farmers and production of energy from renewable sources, universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation, introduction of the unconfiscated tax-free subsidies and compensation, aid to farmers. Updating the ELGA insurance regulation by extending coverage for livestock disasters caused by climate change, something the ministry pretends not to know. The whole process for the new CAP programmes to be completed within one year with specific dates for the submission of evaluation applications and payments, enough of the hassle of bureaucracy. We are abolishing the policy of the runner-up beneficiary through proper planning of resources and not wasting them on wasteful provision for decent housing, language learning for foreign agricultural workers with programmes that will make them stay in our country, so that we do not have to face what has been happening for the last year and a half and is creating a huge problem in the harvest and production. Friends.
