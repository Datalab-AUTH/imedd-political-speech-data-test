So that's why, friends, I ask you. Remember what PASOK is? PASOK is not a party. PASOK. It is a social history, a social current. Which united under our leader Andreas Papandreou the enormous inequalities of the post-civil war state, the enormous injustices towards the Greek people. The persecutions. So what is the debt of this movement now in 2023? It is to answer honestly. That they target me? Of our candidates, of our cadres. It is to confront every pathogen. It keeps the Greek people in the backwardness of the European Union. We represent a proud movement of democratic principles and values. That is why I call on you in the next 4 weeks in the next 30 days to take the effort of this democratic movement into your own hands. Hands expect nothing. From the domestic oligarchy. I expect a lot from all of you, from all Greeks, from all Greek women who want a better future for them and their children. So come and join our forces, join our struggles, join our hopes and make PASOK of the great democratic struggles the protagonist again. The message is clear, a strong PASOK means a new victory. New change, new hope, new prospects, a new perspective, a decision for change with Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipa in the dustbin of history, a decision for change, a decision for brave reforms, brave changes that will bring social justice and national dignity, be well and good luck with our struggle here. The mass gathering from Thessaly shows that PASOK is strong and no matter how much we are beaten we will become even stronger. So let's fight together and fight fight fight fight fight. Our parliamentary candidates from all over Thessaly come on up. Raise the PASOK flags in the days of social justice, in the days of national dignity. Together we will fight the fight and together 21 May we will be victorious, bless you.
