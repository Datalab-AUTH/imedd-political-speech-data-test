What do we suggest? We are proposing that a large amount of the recovery fund should go to the energy upgrade of the networks, so that in the next few years, as all European countries are doing, we can have hundreds of energy communities in regional municipalities in cooperatives, farmers, farmers, farmers, processors, so that they all know that in the next 15 years they will have stable production costs and not be subjected to global turbulence. Is that what the government wants? Your county minister. Just before August 15th.
