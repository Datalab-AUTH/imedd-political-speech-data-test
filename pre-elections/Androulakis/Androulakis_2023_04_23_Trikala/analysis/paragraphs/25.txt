Friends here from Thessaly from the heart of the country's primary production. I would particularly like to refer to the problems that concern the Greek farmer, the Greek farmer. In recent years, the policies of the last governments have caused farmers to be abandoned to their fate. The rural population has decreased in one decade by 260,000 people and the cultivated areas. by 6.5 million acres. 1.3 billion euros in farm income was lost; production costs in the year from January 22 to January 23 increased by 22.4%. Increases in electricity, oil, feed and fertilizer. And what did the New Democracy government do to deal with these suffocating conditions that undermine the competitiveness of agricultural production? It gave, as John said. And following the path of SYRIZA, temporary allowances. But. 70% of our farmers have debts to public funds and the EFKA and of course to the banks the threat of seizures of farm property is stronger than ever. The implementation of the new CAP and its programmes is being significantly delayed, so that farmers do not know what will happen with their applications and when their investments will be subsidised. The new republic's handling of the new problem that has arisen with the shortage of foreign land farmers is robbing valuable hands, leaving our fruits rotting on their trees.
