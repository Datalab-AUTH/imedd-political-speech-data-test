In conclusion. This speech. We are entering the final stretch of the great battle. The twenty-first of April. May. We, as you know very well, are the Party of Democracy. Of consistency and struggle. Which aims to embrace the struggles of all the Greek people. But how do you embrace the agonies of the Greek people? If you don't have a new political ethos? And what is the new political ethos? To prove that all attitudes. that brought us into the Memoranda are a grim past. Any politician who imitates. Bad practices of the past. Leads the country into new economic adventures. Or national. So we have made a decision and we are in debt every day with our action. To prove that we are not all the same. I am not the same as Mr Tsipras, nor am I the same as Mr Mitsotakis. We are not related. We have no links with the creation of digital gangs and digital parastatals that divide the Greek people and which both Mr Tsipras and now Mr Mitsotakis created with our taxes during their years of government. Do you know? It is different. To speak the language of truth? It is another to say, as Mr. Tsipras does, that we are with the victim of abuse. And at the same time.
