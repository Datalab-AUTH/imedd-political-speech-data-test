So I say, from Trikala, vote PASOK so that neither of the two will come. He even has the nerve. And yesterday from my homeland, Crete. To continue the fake news and mythomania, proving his real agony. He says I am preparing a government with Mr Varoufakis. Who says that? Mr Mitsotakis. Who, together with Tsipras, Varoufakis, Samaras and all of them, divided the Greek people when they bankrupted our country. Mr Karamanlis. Who says that? Those who vindicated Mr Georgiou and did not issue a statement to apologise to him. The ones who are united by the common narrative of the country's bankruptcy. When did Mr Tsipras say a word against Mr Karamanlis? Never, barely a few days ago he announced his right-hand man on the ballot papers, Mr Antonaros. When did he ever say a word of criticism of the bankrupt government? Mr Mitsotakis never? So here they come to demand change and pose false dilemmas. This faction has nothing to do with the extreme right-wing of Mr Voridis, Mr Georgiades, Mr Karatzaferis, which Mr Mitsotakis has activated, nor with the extreme populism that Mr Tsipras has brought to the fore, dividing it; it is the democratic faction, it is the PASOK of Andreas Papandreou, which is proudly standing up again as a protagonist in the forefront of our country.
