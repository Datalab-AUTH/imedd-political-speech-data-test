Who cannot appreciate that what they have done in the last eight and a half years has led Greece to continue the merry-go-round of lost opportunities. The toxicity, the division. So what is the real dilemma? The real dilemma is whether we as a nation as a people are building a state that guarantees the public interest and security? Or we continue the game where the rulers will have the state as a booty in their hands with the sole aim of buffoonery and strengthening their power. So we are getting in the way. To the things that bankrupted Greece. The attitudes that drive the young generation abroad. The practices that make citizens frustrated.
