Yes, this impoverished country pays the third highest private health care costs in Europe. We say that the solution is the new NHS.

As well as an increase in the salaries of NHS health workers in line with those of health workers in the rest of the European Union.

Establish social, economic and scientific incentives to stop understaffing in the region, including the health workers of the NHS in the heavy and unhealthy category and not more selective increases in allowances.
