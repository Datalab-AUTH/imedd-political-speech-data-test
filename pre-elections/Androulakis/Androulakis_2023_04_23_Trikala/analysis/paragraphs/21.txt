How will he use the vote of the Greek people? We are asked again. We do not prejudge the will of the Greek people. We don't set up coalitions on the sidelines and behind the scenes we don't say, like Mr Mitsotakis, that the first Sunday doesn't count and we will hold more elections until he becomes prime minister. We speak neither of the government of the winners nor of the losers. I've never seen it before.
