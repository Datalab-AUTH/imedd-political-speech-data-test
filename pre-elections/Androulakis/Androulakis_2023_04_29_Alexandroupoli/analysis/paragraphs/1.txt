Friends, I want to thank you very much for your presence. It is a great honor. Today here in Alexandroupolis we continue our struggle for vindication on May 21, a vindication that is not partisan, it is a vindication against the arrogance of power against the client state against the lack of respect for institutions and democracy against political forces that unfortunately invest in populism and toxicity.
