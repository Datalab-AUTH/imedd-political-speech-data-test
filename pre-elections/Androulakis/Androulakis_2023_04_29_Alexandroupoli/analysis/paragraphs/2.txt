You know very well that for the last eight and a half years we have been living the day of the groundhog, Mr Tsipras used to say. I will tear up the memoranda and he overtaxed the middle class, he brought in the super funds. He brought in a TV licence tender that we have been saying since then was illegal and took his closest associate to the Special Court, convicted with 13 zeros. Instead of having him sent home, he has him on his ballot. This is justice everywhere. Justice for all of us, for all the Greek people, but not for his close associates.
And of course the red loans he was telling you Stisachthia and gave billions of red loans to the funds, which now the loan sharks are extorting thousands of Greek borrowers, small and medium enterprises and leading the Greek economy to wither and depreciation.
