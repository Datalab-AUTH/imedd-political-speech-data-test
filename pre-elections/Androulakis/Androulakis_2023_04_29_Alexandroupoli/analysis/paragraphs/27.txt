So that's why I want as many days as I have left. These three weeks. All of you who believed in this historic movement who fought for this party? Who know too well your ideas, positions, principles and values. Take the struggle of reason and progress in your hands and fight city town town village village to restore the sun of hope of social justice. I am not giving a fight of the chair I am giving a fight of patriotic, national, social justice, solidarity and perspective for you, your children and your grandchildren. That is why I call on you here from Evros, from Alexandroupoli, to give a victory struggle, a struggle for change, a struggle for hope, a struggle without good power.
