We supported the euro against populism. We supported the country to stay in the European Union and not to play games on the backs of the Greek people, but today there are many steps, more steps to keep Europe united, and they are steps of solidarity. Some people cannot fail to learn the lesson of what happened in Ukraine or the fear of the Lithuanians and the Poles. It is the same people in Cyprus. It is the same fear on the Aegean islands and we must all face it together with policies of justice and solidarity. Friends.
