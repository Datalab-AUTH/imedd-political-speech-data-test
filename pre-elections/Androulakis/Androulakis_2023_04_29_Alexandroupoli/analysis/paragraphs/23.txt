So we also want our borders to be guarded with European resources with Fronex. I even remember telling you that as a Member of the European Parliament, when we were talking at the beginning of Frontex that it should be done, it should be reinforced and it should be in the Aegean and in the Evros. I remember some of us were easily told at the time that we were surrendering national sovereignty. So today from here in your city I want to say something more? It's not enough just to have Frodex. Fontex is good, but it's not enough. I'll tell you why it's not enough. I voted for the agreement with France.
We voted for the defense agreements. To strengthen deterrence. The deterrence of our country. Yes, we need armaments. But we don't need an arms rally. We can't hear every month that a new arms deal is in the works. Who will maintain it and who will pay for it? Mr Mitsotakis has thought about this. This money is not for our health, for our education, for our pensioners. So rationalise the arms programmes and there is only one way forward. So just as the Europeans created Frontex, they have a duty to create the Euroarmy, so that Turkey knows that we do not guard our borders alone, that they are European borders, but with all the countries of the European Union. And we are not paying the cost alone.
