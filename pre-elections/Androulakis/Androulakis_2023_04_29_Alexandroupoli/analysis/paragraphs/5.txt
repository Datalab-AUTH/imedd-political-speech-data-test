We didn't have the eavesdropping state, we haven't had such a state for decades and a prime minister appears to cover up for his nephew and the NSA or the competent prosecutor and businessmen who were dealing with these illegal software. Didn't they bring them into parliament, they became a shield to protect this parasite and he says he is a liberal? That is not liberalism. That's agitation for power. It's arrogance. It's all that they have to fight for.
