or does Mitsotakis say I insulted him by not meeting him? He has never asked me for an official meeting, he has never asked me for a meeting on a national issue, on a social issue. According to protocol in Parliament, he sees me one day and says to me in front of 20 journalists, 'Come and meet me, we are not neighbours, nor are we in a caf√© in the Greek Parliament. There are institutional procedures, we are political leaders and we have to behave in an institutional manner. But you know, it's unthinkable that while I'm being lied to that he hasn't said a word when Mr. Economou, the press spokesman of the New Democracy government insulted PASOK during the Easter holidays, but we didn't hear a New Democracy official tell him to apologize or make a statement. So that is why political culture and lessons from those who set up digital gangs on the Internet, an organised parastate, are not accepted by this party of Andreas Papandreou's party of democracy, social justice and Greek dignity.
