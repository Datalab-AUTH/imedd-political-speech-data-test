Second issue, education. Is our education good? Primary education has collapsed. We need to rebuild our school. We can't afford thousands of euros for tutorials, so I suggest.
Let's go to a European policy. With a national baccalaureate, reducing the tuition fees. There is no other solution. Strengthen teaching, remedial teaching, programmes everywhere to reduce inequalities and tutorials, foreign language certification and computer skills. By the third grade. And of course, teacher incentives and evaluation. But objective evaluation, not partisan evaluation. We invest in primary education because we need to upgrade our education. The cost that every family pays for para-education is too high.
