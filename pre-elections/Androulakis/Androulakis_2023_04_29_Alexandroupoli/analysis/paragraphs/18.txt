Also, very important issue for development. Red loans. Our proposal is clear that what we did in 2010 with the first home, we as a government will do in 2023, so that no first home is lost by weak Greeks. We started the protection, Mr Mitsotakis abolished it. We are here without a memorandum so that we can once again ensure that thousands of borrowers are not driven into extortion. Also, 120 instalments for tax and EFKA and anyone who keeps to the regulations and a reduction in the initial amount as an incentive. Swiss franc, 80,000 families are in dire straits we say 1/3 of the interest rate increase will be paid by the borrower 2/3 the banking institutions. And finally, the top issue is the negotiation with the funds. What do the funds want from the economy? Do they want regulation? You are deluding yourself. The loan they took 15% and 20% to sell it 30%-40% to speculate, the quick profit, the easy profit and get out of Greece. What does the borrower gain from this? His destruction. Nothing. The economy? It's being liquidated. Is this what we want to wake up one fine morning and Greek economy, Greek land in the hands of foreign agents at the expense of our people? Are we to be foreigners in our own land? No. That is why we say negotiations with the funds in the framework that was done with the bankers, with the banking sector, with transparency with objective criteria. With the priority of regulation and not extermination. Today the priority of these crows is the extermination of borrowers and the real economy and the democratic party has a duty to stand up against this disastrous political choice that Mr Tsipras led Greece to in 2015.
