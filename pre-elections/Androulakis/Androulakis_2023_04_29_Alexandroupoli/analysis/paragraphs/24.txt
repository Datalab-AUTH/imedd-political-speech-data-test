It was a big issue that we went into the memoranda and into a dire economic situation. It was because the Danes don't have such armaments. The Dutch don't have such armaments, not even the Germans who are an armaments producing country didn't have such armaments. So why should this injustice happen on the backs of the Greek people? That is why it is the position of this party and a personal struggle in all European forums to have a unified foreign policy and a unified defence policy on all borders from Estonia and Lithuania to the Aegean and Cyprus. This means. A Europe of peoples, a Europe of solidarity and not a Europe that is only a single market.
