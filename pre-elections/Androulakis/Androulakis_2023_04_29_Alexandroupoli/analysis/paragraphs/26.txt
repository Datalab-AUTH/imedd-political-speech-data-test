In conclusion, I want you to know that all these things I am saying are also our big priorities for Greece. A strong Greece, not only in the Balkans, a strong Greece within Europe. A strong protagonist that will shape developments and that will not be a laggard of developments. To achieve this we need credible people who can negotiate our national interests. Who can put their hand on the table of the European bureaucracy and not people who are postmen or traffic wardens. Enough is enough. We do not have a policy that pampers ears. We speak plainly. Our progressive speech is clear.
