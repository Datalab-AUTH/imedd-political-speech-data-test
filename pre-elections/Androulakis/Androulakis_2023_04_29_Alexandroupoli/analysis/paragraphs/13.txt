So, what do we propose? A new national health system. To give incentives to doctors and health workers to stay in Greece. Financial incentives. Salaries are too low. The new NHS needs generous funding. Where will we get the money from the Recovery Fund? Is that why Europe made the Recovery Fund? 2-4% is what the new democracy gives. I am committing 8 to 10% of the Recovery Fund to do 2 things to keep doctors and health workers in Greece to fill the gaps, to have permanent staff and of course to make a strong primary health care network, all over Greece where we experienced shortages in the pandemic years. If we had that network, the strong network we would not have. Thousands dead, the vaccination program would have gone better. And hospitals would have continued to provide services to people with serious illnesses, without turning into quintessential hospitals, resulting in fewer preventive medicine screenings and thousands of cancer and heart patients not getting the services they needed.
