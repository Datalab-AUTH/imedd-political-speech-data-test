But we are also with reason and respect for human rights and not these people becoming a weapon in the hands of authoritarian leaders who use them to blackmail Greece, Europe and other countries.
So what are we saying? There are borders and we have a duty to protect our borders, and not alone, together with the Europeans. I do not understand why the Evros fence, which we started, should be paid for by the Greek people and not by European taxpayers. Why is the benefit only for the Greek people? Or for the whole of the European Union?
