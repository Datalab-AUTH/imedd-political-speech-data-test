Just before I close, I would like to say a few words about our national issues and about the refugee migration issue. Refugees are one thing, migration is another. The country has signed international conventions. Which bind not only Greece but also other countries on the refugee issue. But is this what we have been facing in recent years? In 2020 in February this is what we faced? Or a hybrid war on the part of Turkey. What Mr. Erdogan did with Turkey's interior minister, Mr. Zoylou, what Lukashenko did a few months ago in neighboring countries. Obviously we will be with the man.
