Friends. We hear the economy being bombarded by the media. How well the economy is doing. Wages are up 20 to 100 we are running at a rapid rate of growth. That is all very well for them to say but what do the official organisations say that all European and Western countries follow to deal with their economic problems. And I am talking about the OECD. So what does it say? The purchasing power of Greek households is third from the bottom in all European countries and even Mr. Mitsotakis says he lowered the tax rates. And how much do we have 5 billion more revenue from taxes? Do you know how? Because the revaluations every day take millions of euros from your pocket and take them to the new democracy to become a client state, because VAT and indirect taxes hit the weakest and the middle class.
