For pensioners, I hear Mr Mitsotakis saying that we should take our programmes to the accounting department. I say not to the general accounting office, but to an independent committee or to the Budget Office of the Greek Parliament to see who is a populist with a tie, who is a minimalist without a tie and who is telling the truth, because it builds a relationship of trust with every Greek. So we say, we have registered the cost of our program. New EKAS for 350,000 low pensioners the EKAS that Mr Tsipras abolished, leading to the impoverishment of the country's weakest pensioners. Abolition of the personal differential of the Katrougalos and Vroutsis law from 1/01/2024 and of course. Abolish the injustices of the pension provisions concerning disability and widowhood and the 3 together are 1.1 billion euros per year, when New Democracy and SYRIZA in their programs what they say about the pension is more than 5 to 10 billion. Let's see who is telling the truth, who is supporting the weak and who is trying to steal your vote once again.
