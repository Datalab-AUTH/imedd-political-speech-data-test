We also have a duty to talk about young people and social housing, and here in Patras thousands of young people, thousands of young couples cannot find cheap housing. Rents with dignity and housing with dignity. That is why we have announced a programme of 150,000 social housing units, either newly built to the Recovery Fund or with tax incentives and incentives for reconstruction. We are opening up old homes with zero VAT. Sorry zero VAT are put into the social pool and rented out for the next 15 years at low cost to 150,000 couples. What is the difference between our programme and the one announced by the new Republic? Mr Mitsotakis. He gives new home ownership with low-cost loans. What do we say; say to a house with dignity, with low cost and when you get on your feet we will give it to another Greek, because that is how we escalate the cost of living for hundreds of thousands and for more than a generation. This is how the parties think proactively and not to make citizen customers as the new democracy of Mr Mitsotakis wants. Impractical because the cost of buying homes is so high that very few can qualify for the program he has announced.
