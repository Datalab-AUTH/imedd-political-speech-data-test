Friends and friends, cheers. I can't help but talk about health here from Patras. Health means George Gennimatas and Friday Avgerinos. We founded the National Health System. We have a duty to regenerate the national health system. You know very well the problems in Patras NOW the Karamandaneio, the general hospitals of Patras and Aigio are facing very serious problems. We call it No 2 to 4% of the Recovery Fund for the NHS, but 8 to 10 for permanent positions in hospitals and not only auxiliary doctors today which is the day of nurses, we announce again inclusion in the heavy and unhealthy and not only clap for our health workers all over Greece.
And of course, strong, strong primary health care network on the standards of European countries throughout Greece. Salaries, thousands of doctors are leaving for abroad because salaries are too low. We will bring the salaries of doctors and health workers at least to the average of the European Union, so that they have an incentive to stay in our country and to keep our hospitals and the NHS alive, and we say this because the figures are inexorable. Third in private health spending across Europe are Greeks. How is it possible that with the lowest wages we have the third most expensive health spending for the Greek people? And when the prices of medicines are soaring, I pledge here in Patras that the new era of PASOK will revive the National Health System for a new social safety net for all Greeks, especially the underprivileged and the middle class.
