Friends, in closing, it is a great honour for me. Today, here in the land of our founder, we have held this great gathering that sends a message of victory to all of Greece.
We are the party that asks every Greek democrat, every Greek progressive to remember the deeds of the historical social force of Andreas Papandreou's movement in the next 10 days. This party never disdained the intelligence of the Greek people, never said seismic, never said no house in the hands of a banker and never said no house in the hands of a banker and surrendered the poorest Greeks to the teeth of the funds and speculators. The party of never spoke of democracy and institutions, of transparency and meritocracy and in parastatalism is the party that ended the post-civil war parastatalism is the party that 21 May ended any thought of decay of the institutions of democracy, the rule of law and human rights in Greece.
