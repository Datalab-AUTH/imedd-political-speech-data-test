Friends. I cannot but dwell on the issue of interception. Because we were really surprised by Mr Mitsotakis at the debate of the political leaders. For months, New Democracy officials have been dropping poisonous hints. They were watching me because I was an agent of China. Turkey. Armenia. And various other fanciful scenarios. The Prime Minister came and said something very, very simple. That they were never a national danger. I didn't expect a stamp of national sentiment from the leader of the new republic. We all know each other well in this country and we all have a relationship with foreign and powerful interests. Who we are funnel and who we genuinely represent the struggles of the ordinary fighting Greek people.
But with this statement. There duty before the public prosecutor to call Mrs. Vlachou and tell her what you signed for national reasons Mrs. Vlachou? Nothing will fall down because the narrative legitimate monitoring, but politically incorrect collapsed in the debate and the 2 days ago. It was an illegal surveillance despicable for a European country. So that is why I will fight to the end in Greek and European justice, not for me, but for democracy and for all of you. Is this not a personal matter? It is a question of the country's dignity and credibility abroad.
