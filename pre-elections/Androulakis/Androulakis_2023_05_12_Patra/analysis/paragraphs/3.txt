Friends. We have a duty to become a strong European country with a strong European country with a resilient welfare state with sustainable growth, with strong democracy. These have always been our historical precepts. We will achieve these things again, but o all together for this take the struggle of the democratic party in your hands. We are in debt. To work every day for the struggles of the younger generations and especially the hundreds of thousands of children who have fled abroad in the last 15 years of the economic crisis. We are not the party of where we go and where we come from. We are the party of the concrete, of the programme, of real progress and not of the toxicity, of the populism of Mr Tsipras and the clientelistic elitism of Mr Mitsotakis.
