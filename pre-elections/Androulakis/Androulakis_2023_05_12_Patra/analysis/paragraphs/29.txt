Friends. Establishment of the unconditional and tax-free nature of subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers. Updating the ELGA insurance regulation by extending the coverage of disasters to livestock and crops caused by climate change. Is it possible that in 2023, when there is worldwide talk of climate change, our farmers will not be compensated for the phenomena that will escalate in the future? But we remember very well how they and George Papandreou were despised when we were talking about a green transition for green growth and 15 years later they do not know what climate change means and Mr Tsipras even discovered it in the tragedy in Mati.
