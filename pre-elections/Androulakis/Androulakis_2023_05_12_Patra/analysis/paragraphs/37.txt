We say to our youth, make your fear a force for change. We say make your hope a force for change and make the fear offered by the right and SYRIZA a force for liberation here in Patras. Be well, we are going strong for the great victory. Let us choose our future with hope and not the fear they offer and the toxicity they offer to the Greek people. Together we will win, I am sure. Be well and good strength.
