Friends. The sun is rising all over Greece because we are united as one, because we believe in the visions, the principles and the values of the third of September and we proudly raise again the flag, the green flag of the PASOK sun. Friends, strong powerful economic interests and the domestic oligarchy draw the danger of ungovernability. What will it do? Does PASOK say it will leave the country ungoverned? There is no danger of ungovernability after every election. A government always emerges. The question is does the government serve the terrorists of the oligarchy or does it give them the real problems of the Greek people's daily life? Mr. Tsipras, Mr. Mitsotakis in recent days have been making a plethora of benefits. They are buying off or trying to buy off even the consciousness of the younger generation, as one did at 15 and the other at 19. Mr Mitsotakis even took the Youth Pass out of his pocket. So I call on every young person in the country to turn their back on the right's contempt for the real problems of Greek youth that are not being addressed with Mr Mitsotakis' â‚¬150.
