Today. Today. Under simplicity or arrogance and the sadness of the Mitsotakis system went beyond all limits. And I say this because a few days ago I was in the martyrdom of Kalavryta. I insisted, as our party has historically, on the need for German reparations, as decided by the Greek Parliament on 17/04/10 9 within a specific framework that all parties have a duty to fight for justice for the heroes who fought Nazism and are heroes that are recorded in the collective memory of every Greek. I did not expect one of Mr Mitsotakis' closest associates to say that this is a thing of the past. In a few days' time, the past will belong to Mr Mitsotakis and his entourage, who even despise the struggles of the Greek people. The difficult years of occupation.
He had the audacity, Mr. Skertsos himself a week ago to say that the New Democracy is the party that has always been on the right side of history. He seems to forget that it is the party that bankrupted Greece. It is the party that for many years did not allow a real assessment of why we got into the memoranda? The stork did not succeed in the memoranda or bankrupt New Democracy, but their audacity is common and that proves the common audacity of Syriza and New Democracy. In iconoclasm.
The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the person of Mr. George a statement of apology was not issued by the right, nor by SYRIZA, who for years now have been spraying the Greek people with conspiracy theories, instead of saying something simple, that in 2009 PASOK took in its hands a bankrupt Greece with the stamp of the right-wing party. But how can Mr Tsipras, who also gives me lessons in progress, say that?
