Dignity? What does dignity mean for the poorest Greek for the middle class? Dignity means that in an hour of need he will not wait in hospitals for the lists of shame. He will not be afraid of losing his first home. The young man will not fear that he will not be able to rent his own home and raise his family. For us, therefore, dignity means that the Greek child, at the time when he or she is making his or her computerised form, plans his or her dreams for the future and does not weigh his or her choices against the wallet of her father, her mother, her grandfather and her grandmother. Dignity means no Greek should feel only on the margins. This is the strong welfare state envisioned by PASOK 2023. Dignity means good, well-paid jobs with labour rights. And not the development of Mr Mitsotakis that creates 400 and 500 â‚¬ jobs for 700,000 workers. What they make one job with flexibility make 2 jobs. We say jobs, dignity jobs to deal with our demographic, to keep Greek children in Greece, to make a strong and competitive economy and not and not to look for the next plane up to go to the countries of the European Union.
