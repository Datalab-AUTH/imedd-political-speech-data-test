Friends. A crucial issue is demography. The tax rates between a family with no children and a family with 2 children are 2 points different in Portugal, they are 10 points different. So we are supporting with serious tax incentives all families with children in the country, because the democratic party believes that the greatest national issue of our time is demographic shrinkage.
