For our farmers. PASOK once had a spot that said blood is not water. Every Greek farmer knows very well who gave them dignity, prospects and competitiveness in the 1980s and what is the soil that made their children scientists with prospects in society, so we are talking about redemptive solutions to keep the competitiveness index of the primary sector high. In recent years there has been a steep or increase in production costs. We do not say. Subsidies on special agricultural inputs, animal feed, fuel with zero excise duty on agricultural oil. Until the energy crisis is over. Renewable energy communities. It is a proposal that I believe we must implement immediately.
