Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this impressive gathering here from the land where the Old Man of Democracy was born from his homeland, our founder Andreas Papandreou, with a message of victory from one end of the country to the other. Friends, this democratic and proud party, which sealed with its dynamic presence the years of post-independence, is reborn on May 21 and we ask for a strong mandate of victory, change, perspective, hope for every Greek woman, for every Greek here from Patras, from Achaia, from Western Greece. We are the party that changed Greece, that made the country believe in itself, that made Greece a creative, democratic, strong Greece, that made leaps of progress and prosperity, bringing the hard core of the countries of the European Union. We are the party that identified with the struggles and passions of the Greek people, embodied their dreams, inspired generations and made the Greeks experience the best days of their modern history. This is PASOK and this PASOK is here today, united, strong.
