One of them asks us to forget his past and to vote for SYRIZA again without having said an apology for co-governing with the extreme right-wing Kammenos, while he was saying first time leftist first time leftist was Mr.Tsipras only in 1981. The other one asks you to forget all about the difference, the Patchids, the Tempi, the interceptions, the direct assignments. And what does he tell you to be afraid that Syriza is coming? So vote for a new democracy, the message of all of us here today from Achaia is vote for PASOK so that both of them can go home or the Greek people will be in contempt. Don't choose with fear but choose with real hope for a better tomorrow.
