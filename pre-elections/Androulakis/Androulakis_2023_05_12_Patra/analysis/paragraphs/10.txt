Trust means justice, but justice for all, not just for the few, for those who feel that no matter what they do they will always go unpunished. And I say this because Mr Tsipras also has the greatest audacity. I know of no other European, supposedly progressive, who is condemned as a close associate of the former Prime Minister. 13-0, one Special Court and instead of going home he too is decorating the Syriza ballot papers. What does this behavior prove when they say justice everywhere they mean for all of us, but not for them, for their cronies, for their relatives, as Mitsotakis did with his nephew Demetriades, the protagonist of the wiretapping and the 2023 parastate.
