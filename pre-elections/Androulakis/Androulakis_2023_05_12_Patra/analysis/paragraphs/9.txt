Even in Tempe, they despised human suffering. They told us that the transfer of the disputed stationmaster was not illegal, Mr Georgiadis, Mr Voridis, every day on the TV channels they said it was a legal transfer. And the three-member committee that Mr Mitsotakis appointed, announced that it was the illegal transfers of the stationmaster, have the courage to tell us whose New Democracy MP's party buffoonery was this fatal man that led to the tragedy? Do they have the courage to tell us why? Apart from this criminal buffoonery, why did Mr Karamanlis hide the report of the independent transparency authority in his drawer? Which was completed on October 21 and which told precisely which persons in the Syriza and New Democracy governments were responsible for the fact that it was never implemented. The 717 contract of 2014 of the Telecommunications Authority that if it NEVER existed will be lost vertically will be lost unjustly. These 57 human lives why did Mr. Karamanlis not take this finding to justice? And if Mr Karamanlis does not tell it for his own reasons, why does Mr Mitsotakis have him on the New Democracy ballot paper? So until when are there islands of impunity? So when will there be contempt for the public interest? How long will our state be a spoil of power in the hands of the Right and Syriza?
