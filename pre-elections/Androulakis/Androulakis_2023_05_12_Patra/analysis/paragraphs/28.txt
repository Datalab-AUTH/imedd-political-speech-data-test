Because what has Mr Tsipras achieved? Mr Mitsotakis? To slowly leave lignite, which is of course a European policy. And instead of going to green energy in order to be geopolitically secure, because we consume the energy we produce from the sun from the air, they have committed millions of fibres and producers to imported expensive natural gas for the benefit of the energy oligarchs. We interconnect the de-lignification with the infrastructure in the grid and storage and we make priority interconnection in the grid the parks of farmers, farmers, cooperatives, processors, photovoltaics on the roofs for the poorest Greeks so that we do not go to energy inequalities in energy poverty and collapse of domestic production from the future energy cost increase of the country.
