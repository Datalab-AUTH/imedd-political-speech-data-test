The PASP is here to make it strong again after the next national elections, because our movement embraced the Greek Youth? Because our movement does not forget that it was the youth that made it strong in 1974. Well, all Greeks and especially the young generation. Join us because we will give confidence, we will ensure dignity and prospects to the people. But what does confidence mean today in 2023? How will citizens feel trust when they fear for the labours, the sacrifices of their family members?
