Friends, as I said before, the priority is demography, so I pledge to every Greek mother that with PASOK in government, no Greek child will be left out of nurseries and creative employment centres. We have a legislative initiative ready, which the government rejected a few months ago, but we will bring it back in the new parliamentary term. To strengthen the maternity allowance for freelance mothers who, unfortunately, due to the economic crisis, leave their child at home to reopen their office. This is another huge injustice that we must address for the benefit of the Greek mother.
