Friends. But I cannot, here in Patras, not respond to Faulity about the political legacy of Andreas Papandreou.Andreas Papandreou fought the Right and conservation. Andreas Papandreou asked every democrat progressive leftist to join us for the big changes. Andreas Papandreou is the man who stopped all distinctions, political, social, religious, class. So how some people are trying to make fun of Andreas Papandreou. We do not invoke the name of our hero occasionally, because it is our history, it is our DNA. It is our struggles, it is our faith. But I hear some. To say that Andreas Papandreou.
He inspires them. Do you know? Whatever they say because they have a habit of falsifying history. They can't rewrite the recent history of the country. Why did Andreas fight the Right? He brought the left to the forefront in 1981 the progressive democratic left. And he is the leader who the thanks he was told was together to take it to the Special Court, so we don't forget our history, no matter how much they try to falsify it.
