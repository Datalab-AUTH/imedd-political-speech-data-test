Our vision Our vision is not for Greece to become a huge hotel. A giant short-term lease in the hands of funds and foreign powers. Our vision is the interconnection of all productive sectors of the country with measurable characteristics. How many millions of travelers come and how many millions of them taste the products of the Greek land, processed and unprocessed, so that we create the conditions for high extroversion? Only in this way, only in this way our country will face the trade deficits that this year, but they will not say that on the channels.
