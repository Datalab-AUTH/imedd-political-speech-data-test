Friends and friends, they despise our political culture, no more discounting of democratic principles, no more erosion of constitutional institutions, no more trivialisation of parliamentary morals. They are the ones who, with their internet parastate, are crushing the dignity of those who think that it stands in their way of your money from your taxes; they are the ones who have set up their digital parastate of SYRIZA and New Democracy, who used to say that I was an agent when they were watching me in the middle of our democratic processes. And a girl who denounced her abuse became a victim in the teeth of this parastate. So we, the democratic party with the principles and values are leading their digital parasite to the dustbin of history. There is no need to divide the young generation with this nonsense spread by the trumped up fake news of Maximos and Mr. Tsipras. We represent another political ethos, the ethos of consistency, the ethos of consistency, the ethos of truth, the ethos of the real and concrete programme.
