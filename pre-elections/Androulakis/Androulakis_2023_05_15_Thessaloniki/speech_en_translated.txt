Friends and friends. Friends, the democratic party is here. PASOK is here. Our movement has returned dynamically to the political forefront of Greek history. Your presence tonight at Velideion confirms that on 21 May we are sending a message of victory, hope and perspective for all Greeks. For every democratic and progressive citizen, the return of the democratic party is now clearly a fact. In every part of the country, in every meeting, I see smiles, hope and need everywhere. We are embracing again the struggles of the vulnerable and the middle class. We are becoming the people-born movement founded in 1974, the movement of great change and great reform. We are the party that changed Greece, that made it truly believe in itself, to become more democratic, more creative, more powerful, to make leaps of hope, growth, progress and prosperity. This party brought the people to power, inspired the younger generations and offered equal opportunities for advancement, creating for all Greeks a strong, undivided middle class. That is why our political opponents have intensified their attacks on us in recent days as they see our political opponents, the people's league of the democratic party, attacking us above and below the table. And of course, together with them and the interests that support them, who daily slander our stance, they devalue the decision that you have taken together, all together, for an autonomous course away from commitments, away only for conflicts, away from enslavement to powerful interests, with autonomy of conflict to really bring the great changes that the Greek people need.

Friends. But I want to confide something to you here from Thessaloniki. In the last few hours I am almost bursting with sadness. After Mr Mitsotakis' statements that he has nothing to say to PASOK. Mr Mitsotakis, I and all of us, all democrats, all progressive citizens, have nothing to say to the eavesdropping parastate. We have nothing to do with the leader of the Patsis who speculated with red loans at the expense of the poorest Greeks. The people have not forgotten what the Right means, so they are rebirthing its real opponent and not its sponsor, Mr Tsipras. Friends, what do we have to say to the champion of direct assignments, the champion of postponements, the champion of widespread corruption? What do we have to say to the champion of inequalities, the champion of the grafting of the Greek economy?

In the last twenty-four hours, Mr Mitsotakis has really shown who has a personal obsession. He is trying to convince the PASOK cadres, the friends of PASOK, the voters of PASOK, that I am leading you into a blind front against New Democracy. But the truth is one. That in the last few days there has been nesting within it the anxiety and fear that what is being born, the new one, will be the real opponent. It will be the democratic party of serious opposition, of the programme, of perspective, and not the cheap populism of Mr Tsipras. Because Mr Mitsotakis knows very well in his heart that if it were not for Tsipras, his government would already be a thing of the past in the minds of the Greek people. Friends, he is looking for a life jacket. He knows that the only lifeline is the Greek people's previous experience of 15-19 with Tsipras and Kammenos. I imagine he would want another PASOK and not this PASOK, the current PASOK. He wanted a subordinate PASOK, but all of you 200,000, 270,000 democratic citizens sent him a strong message on 12 December and I call on all the Greek people to send him a new message on 21 May.

Mr Mitsotakis thinks that the people are forgetting the history of his family, with its history of defections, its history of games, its history of parastatism. We are in 2023 and no democrat progressive citizen can bear such a downfall for our country, a European country. PASOK will not become a crutch for anyone because it has deep historical and social roots. Mr Mitsotakis is also trying to hit us politically by saying that we are statists, that we are not the progressive modernisers, implying that he is the progressive moderniser. However, and I urge the Greek people to remember that he is such a progressive moderniser that if we put his and his family's buffers in a row, they exceed the length of the Great Wall of China. This is the reality, Mr Mitsotakis, we have a memory as Greek people, we have a memory of who they are and which families have created political dowries by buffoonery at the expense of the public interest.

On the one hand, Mr Tsipras cannot even utter the word PASOK, but on the other hand he is giving us history lessons. He said yesterday that Andreas Papandreou had never said that he had no front with the progressive forces. And I ask him, are Antonaros and the Kammenos orphans who filled his ballot papers progressive forces? Or is it a progressive front the digital parasite run by Koumoundourou that attacks political opponents, accusing them one day of being taken and the next of being blackmailed. It is the leader of a digital parasite that had no moral bottom to target a young woman, a comrade who reported her abuse. If this is the left, then Mr Tsipras is living in Latin America.

The left that is at the heart and soul of the democratic party is the rule of law, respect for human rights and the separation of powers. PASOK is here, comrades. Friends, PASOK is here to embrace the progressive Left, the progressive centre and the aspirations of every democratic citizen, away from the discord, away from the toxic conflicts that are pinning down the future of our country. But what are progressive forces, to recall the events of a little earlier? Are the ones who shouted Hangmen in the Constitution and compared the elected Prime Minister of the country, George Papandreou, with Pinochet, the dictator of Chile, progressive forces? Or was it? Or are they progressive forces who in the '15 election said to the people don't pay your loans, here we come. We will bring stubbornness. And they also said no house in the hands of a banker and they brought electronic auctions, reduction of first home protection and sold billions of euros of red loans in '15 to blackmail the weakest citizens. The crows of the funds. This is the Left and Mr Tsipras' progress here is the Left of protecting the first home. This is the Left that is standing in the way of the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy.

Friends, yes, we have a front, we have a front with all of them. Because, quite simply, we have a front against authoritarianism and misery in public debate. We have a front against the organised gangs of the Internet. We have a front against those who, for the sake of the chair, for the sake of power, are capable of saying the same and the opposite and sacrificing the public interest of the Greek people. Friends, they have the audacity to play with the memory of Andreas Papandreou, our founder. Let us make it clear from here. Let us make it clear here in Thessaloniki. Andreas Papandreou, who belongs to the history of the democratic, progressive history of this country. Andreas Papandreou, Mr Tsipras, cannot be exploited by those who talk about dangerous theories about Prespes and the Aegean. Andreas Papandreou and the patriotic PASOK do not go hand in hand with the Aegean Prespes, Mr Tsipras. Andreas Papandreou and this patriotic people's movement are not going with the dangerous theories that there are no borders at sea. So leave our founder, our historical leader, the greatest politician of Greece since the Second World War, Andreas Papandreou, alone in history. This political giant has nothing to do with your dangerous adventurism. But he has the audacity to lecture us on how New Democracy will fall. Who? Its major sponsor, who every week will say something to give Mr Mitsotakis a field to run on. On the one hand, local currencies, on the other, the Evros fence, which they suddenly say yes, but that European taxpayers should not pay for it. Admittedly, this is the big issue for Syriza and various other things that simply show a need. Fight every day on 21 May to have its real opponent, New Democracy, because with Mr Tsipras and his company, Mr Mitsotakis feels completely safe.

But, friends, let's go to our programme that wants to give a new breath to the Greek economy. The programme, the social democratic programme, the programme of Democratic Socialism, the programme that reduces inequalities and creates opportunities and hopes for all Greek children, for all families. One promises things that cannot be done and the other hides what is going to happen with his budgetary choices. They boast about growth, about good statistics, when in reality our performance is unfortunately negative, as the OECD figures show. More than two and a half million Greeks are currently threatened with poverty and social exclusion, according to official figures. They praise that they reduced taxes, but the taxes paid by citizens in 2022 were 5 billion more than the targets. If this is not overtaxation, what is it? And even more so if we put on the table that most of these taxes are due to VAT consumption and special taxes that beat up the weakest, the workers, the unemployed and the middle class. They say they have increased the minimum wage by 20% and dispute the OECD figures of a 7.4% reduction in real wages. Unemployment, they say, is falling, but the new jobs are mostly €400 part-time jobs. This growth that has Mr Mitsotakis' name on it is creating real estate with internal loans. In a few years, with this policy, we will be foreigners in our country. Students will not be able to rent a house with dignity in the centre of Thessaloniki and the centre of Athens. Young couples will not be able to build their future with dignity and have children. And on the other hand, Mr Tsipras thinks that the economy is a cow that gives out milk without ever being fed.

So it is time for us, the democratic party, to put an end to these outdated models of power and create a broad social alliance for a strong Greece of the future, so that we can become a normal European country again. This is our vision, a normal European country that respects the citizen, respects the environment and that growth is sustainable and socially just for all Greeks. We have a duty to build a modern welfare state with high-quality benefits and services, not a youth pass. Mr Mitsotakis cannot disregard the young generation in this way, a young generation with few opportunities and many skills, and just before the elections try to buy consciences with EUR 150. This shows the quality of New Democracy's politics.

Also the green transition. The green transition, for Mr Mitsotakis, is a business for the few.

For us, it is a policy that makes Greece a country at the forefront of sustainable development and gives priority to the weakest, to the middle class, to the real producers, farmers, manufacturers, to make choices with photovoltaics, renewable sources, with a fair democratized energy transition that will not lead to new energy poverty.

With strong public health and education. The state is staffed by open international competitions, if PASOK is strong. It is my commitment to meritocracy and transparency in the public sector and not to say that after Tempe we have come this far, but after Tempe they will continue the same, with no commitment that hospitals and organisations will be staffed by open international competitions because they simply want to continue the client state of failed MPs and agents.

This state is undermining the efforts and sacrifices of the Greek people. This is the state that led to Tempe. This is the state that the Transparency Authority pointed to in October 21 for the huge responsibilities for not having a telecommunications system, and this is the state that Mr Karamanlis hid in his drawer so that they would not be brought to justice. And instead of going home he is decorating the ballot papers of the New Democracy in Serres. This is political ethics and this is contempt for the families of the victims of Tempi.

Friends. But what should we do? We must find a public space and create the conditions for a just development. For dividends. We cannot follow the policy of the New Democracy. The New Republic put a 5% across the board. And I start from this because there has been a very big discussion about where the parties will get the money and Mr Mitsotakis even proposes that we take our programmes to the general accounting office of the state. We say to the Budget Office of the House of Representatives. Let us see who is telling the truth.  But let us start from the simple. Why 5% on dividends? What does the 2022 data say? 150 listed companies have quadrupled their profits when in '22 the weakest Greek and the middle class were impoverished. This policy cannot continue to coddle the domestic oligarchy. Despite the energy crisis and high inflation, they will distribute a record dividend of two and a half billion euros.

What do we propose? Up to 50.000€, 5% on dividends. And above 50,000, the tax is graduated to the highest level, 15%.

Also, banks. The banks, we've given billions for their capital adequacy. They too profited in the crisis, when the interest rate on deposits and mortgages was the highest in Europe.

What do we say? What Spain did. Tax the super profits as long as they don't change their policy to financially support the middle class and the new generation, their entrepreneurship.

Parental benefits. From here, from the TIF, Mr Mitsotakis said and did. Because whatever he says about the powerful, he does. The people, the middle class, he deliberately mocks. So he said 800,000 euros per parent. And 800,000 euros per grandparent. 4.8 million euros tax-free on parental benefits for each child. Which middle-class child, which child of a vulnerable Greek family is affected by the transfer of wealth up to 4.8 million euros without tax, Mr Mitsotakis? In which Greece are you pursuing these policies in Greece where hundreds of thousands of young Greek children have left for a better day abroad? So much for that.

What do we say? 400,000€ tax-free across the board, not a single euro more, no multiplication. 400,000€ is a fair limit for the tax-free parental allowance. It was €200,000 in the past.

Pensioners. What do we propose? You hear about billions of euros of pensions. They feed everything. Our program is 1.13 billion. What is it? Support for the weakest pensioners. The ESAS that Mr Tsipras abolished, we are bringing it back as a new ESAS for 350,000 low pensioners who are in despair. We abolish from 1/01/24 the personal difference, and finally, change the law of the New Democracy and SYRIZA to increase the contributory pension and abolish the unfair provisions on disability and widow's pensions. These 3 fair options are 1.13 billion and not 6 or 10 billion as New Democracy and Syriza are trolling by knowingly mocking pensioners.

Friends, demographics, the mother, the mother, the mother, the fighter of everyday life. This party has made it a priority to tackle the greatest national danger of our country, the demographic bomb. That is why I pledge that no child will be left in the coming years without a crèche and a creative activity centre, so that the Greek mother can continue her life as normal. Economic and social life. We also have a ready-made legislative initiative which we had submitted in the past, but which was rejected by the New Democracy, to strengthen the maternity allowance for mothers of freelance workers. This is another of our commitments to support the Greek mother. Finally, very crucially if you look at the OECD figures, a family with no children in Greece and a family with 2 children in Greece have a 3-point difference in taxation. Portugal has 10 points and other countries with a similar population have 8-9 points. I am committed that we will reduce the tax on every family with children to create strong tax incentives to address the demographics.

Friends, our priority is also to tackle private debt, to protect the main house and to prevent the deflation of the Greek economy.

We insist on lowering taxes on wage labour to reduce black work and to have good wages, especially for the young generation who are currently condemned to very low wages, unable to build a decent future.

Also central to our commitment to young people is our social housing programme. Rents are soaring in all urban centres. Mr Mitsotakis has made a programme, we have just started talking about social housing, which does not give low-rent houses, it gives low-interest loans to buy a house based on the price per square metre. Very few people will have access to that policy. We don't want to build new property. We want the state to own property, plus houses closed - in Thessaloniki there are about 15,000 - that will open with zero ENVIA and incentives for reconstruction from the Recovery Fund. What does this mean? An aggregate of 150,000 homes across Greece, in urban centres with social criteria, students, young couples. When you can stand on your own two feet, you leave and someone else comes in, so this will help not only 150,000 young couples but hundreds of thousands of Greeks who are desperate because of the cost of living. Our priority is to bring the cost of living down immediately, because Greece is a country with low wages and a huge comparative cost of living for Greeks.

Health. I can't not mention health because the child of PASOK is the National Health System. We made it, we are committed to revive it. It is the child of George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos. It is the child of the need to have public health services so that our country can stop being the third country in Europe in private spending. Only Bulgaria and Lithuania surpass Greece in health care costs. What are we saying? We from the Recovery Fund say not 2-4% like New Democracy, but 8-10% so that we build strong primary care that reaches the home of the Greek in every case. Also, staffing hospitals with 15,000 permanent medical staff of 15,000 doctors, and raising the salaries of all health workers to the European Union average. We also need to introduce social, economic and scientific incentives to stop the understaffing of hospitals in the periphery. Finally. A commitment that many have said, but no one has made: inclusion in the heavy and unhealthy work of health workers to end the pandemic clapping. We have a duty to do it and we will do it.

Friends, education. There is no other tool for social democrats, for a society of social mobility, for a society of low inequalities, if there is no strong public education. So what do we propose? A national baccalaureate. There is a huge talk about the base 10. Is that the only problem? Mr Tsipras is trying to fish in murky waters. Did any young people hear that no exams will get them into universities. But I must tell the restless youth that nowhere in the world do they get into universities without any exams at all. Let Mr Tsipras drop the mockery. No more mockery for young people too. It is a disgrace to not honour the young people of our country. So what is the national diploma? A national baccalaureate is not judging your future on an exam, with all that it means for the psychology of the student and the family. It is decided in the last 2 years by multiple exams and post-university options, where not only one exam but also the grade of the diploma plays an important role. What is the goal of this change? To take the focus off of tutoring and put the focus back on public school so that all students have adequate knowledge, adequate skills, and are competitive with a future perspective. Friends, and of course, with strong remedial teaching for all. And finally, strong special education structures everywhere. Only in this way will a socialist party create an inclusive school and all children of all Greeks will be able to participate equally with any learning difficulties in this strong public school. It is our commitment, as is the increase in teachers' salaries and real evaluation, not evaluation by second-raters, as imposed by the New Democracy party-state. Friends, outward-looking universities. What does an extroverted university mean? It is a university that is linked to innovation, to research, a university without family rule, a university that does not argue about the university police.

Do you remember what was happening in the last few years here in Thessaloniki? A field of conflict. Where are the university police? You paid for it, you paid for Mr Mitsotakis' university police with your taxes. Where is it today? There is no university police. Why hasn't what we said happened? The simple. What are they doing all over Europe? They're putting in university security companies. Cameras in the laboratories, which are expensive machines paid for by the Greek taxpayer, and when there is an offence at the university, the normal police enter, as they do in every other place in Greece, without it being a sanctuary. It is a sanctuary of ideas, it is a sanctuary of research, it is a sanctuary of dignity; the Greek university is not a field of ideological clashes between New Democracy and Syriza at the expense of Greek students.

My friends, the small and medium-sized enterprises. The government touts the high GDP growth rates after the pandemic, but they are due to consumption and tourism. Because real productive foreign investment was only 14% of all foreign investment, with the rest being real estate and the acquisition of existing Greek businesses. The question is therefore relentless for Mr Mitsotakis: who has benefited from this growth strategy? Certainly not small and medium-sized enterprises, which remain on the sidelines. They are excluded from the favourable loans of the Recovery Fund. The evidence is inexorable. Its first 1.2 billion has been taken by 67 companies at 1.1% interest, not SMEs. What are we saying? The Recovery Fund should have a special financial institution that will finance SMEs beyond market criteria, with digital criteria, with convergence criteria, environmental criteria, new jobs, so that people who cannot get into banks can borrow from this financial institution. Portugal has already done this.

Friends, for sustainable development, with environmental protection, we need to change the energy model. We need a Greek national development that will invest in Made in Greece. What is Made in Greece? It is to know every year how many of the millions of travelers who came to Greece consume domestic Greek products, so that not only the islands and tourism win, but the whole Greek economy wins, the wines, the oil, the processed agri-food products, so that we strengthen exports and create good jobs throughout Greece. We are also proposing a three-year exemption from capital gains tax for new business clusters created by networking and partnerships, special funding, funding lines from the NSRF for the relocation of medium-sized enterprises to organised craft parks, special funding lines from the Recovery Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises' investments in innovation, energy adaptation, digital transformation. Finally, the creation of product development centres in the regions to provide technical assistance, standardisation planning for the development of new products and their distribution networks.

Friends, before I closed on small and medium-sized enterprises, I heard Mr Mitsotakis say, but why are you asking for 120 instalments? We did it. So ask your friends in Thessaloniki, the small and medium-sized enterprises, how many of them were able to join the 120 instalments that Mr Mitsotakis gave? To understand to what extent he disregards the real problems of the Greek economy. That is why I am committed to 120 instalments for everyone, both for the tax office and for the EFKA, and a 30% reduction in the capital for anyone who keeps their instalments to the end.

For our Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki can become the capital of the Balkans. We have been saying this for many years, but we can do it if there is a strategy for developing its potential and exploiting its geostrategic position. Of course, always by linking it with neighbouring countries. But the current reality is unfortunately not what we want. It deprives the country of GDP, jobs, wealth and takes away our potential economic openness. We need to focus on speeding up the implementation of the city's infrastructure, because unfortunately Thessaloniki is lagging behind. Metro and airport connections to the western districts, flood protection works, vertical axes with the Egnatia Odos, the regional road, new school facilities and health centres in the city. PASOK's priority is first and foremost the city's urban transport system, which has been in an unacceptable state for many years. A permanently ailing OASΘ without vehicles and drivers that cannot cope with the great transport task of the time.

The city, as you know all too well, paid the cost of the pandemic disproportionately, but without its hospitals being reinforced afterwards. After the experience, the tragic experience of the pandemic. To summarise, the new paediatric hospital, the development of the health park on the western side of the city, with the creation of the new oncology hospital and the strengthening of primary care are our priorities for a Thessaloniki that is a true capital of the Balkans, a real protagonist of developments.

Friends, Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki today sends a message of hope to every part of the country for the next 6 days. The struggle will make us the strong leading force in our country. Friends, your presence today is truly moving and shows that the more they fight us, the stronger we grow.

Friends, I can't help but mention national issues after yesterday's Turkish elections. If there is one thing that Mr Erdogan and Mr Kilicdaroglu agree on, it is the constant questioning of our sovereign rights. Unfortunately, the government and the official opposition are handling all these serious foreign policy issues in terms of communication. Last March, when, after a lunch with Mr Erdogan on the Bosphorus, Mr Mitsotakis was celebrating a new era in Greek-Turkish relations. We also saw it with Albania the day before yesterday. A few months ago, Mr Mitsotakis visited Northern Epirus, and the Albanian Prime Minister admired him. And yet, three days before the municipal elections, we saw the imprisonment of the expatriate mayor of Himarra, Freddy Beleri, who, despite the adversity and terror of the Albanian authorities, managed to win and we congratulate him here from Thessaloniki for showing that nothing can prevent the right of the Greek minority of Northern Epirus.

Friends, but the elephant in the room is Turkey, let's be honest. We want a stable neighbouring country, but we also need a unified European foreign policy, a policy based on respect for international law and not a policy that coddles Turkey, making it feel unchecked and unconstrained. But the Greek borders are not only Greek, they are also Euro-Turkish, and I think it is unfair that we Greeks should pay billions of euros to guard our borders and those of the rest of Europe. It is a huge disadvantage for the rule of law, sorry for the welfare state, when we give billions for armaments, something that the Danes, the Dutch, the Germans and other central Europeans do not do. What needs to be done? I have said it many times. Unified armaments. The European army, like Frontex, which guards the Greek borders, has become a European army, just as the Europeans have to put their hand in their pockets and for the fence on the Evros, they have to put their hand deep in their pockets to pay for the guarding of the Greek-Turkish border. And let them learn a lesson from the events in Ukraine. It is unfair for the Greek people to pay billions in armaments without co-productions, without the prospect of a common defence and foreign policy.

Finally, whatever government emerges in Turkey, Europe has a duty to stop sending even one bullet to Turkey. As long as it continues its policy of violating neighbouring sovereign rights. The arms embargo. I do not often hear the arms embargo from either Mr Mitsotakis or Mr Tsipras, because they go and do public relations. The arms embargo is not a nationalist choice of a patriotic movement like PASOK. It is the Europe of peoples, it is the Europe of solidarity, where no European can arm a country that is breaking the law against another people from the 27.

Friends, there are only 6 days left. I am addressing all generations here from Thessaloniki and I am really happy because all generations are here today. It is the generation of 114, it is the generation of the founding of PASOK, it is the generation of the 1980s, it is the generation of the 1990s and it is the generation that will renew and make the democratic party a protagonist again. So I am addressing every democrat and every progressive who believes deeply in the rule of law, who believes deeply in respect, in human rights, who believes deeply in sustainable development, who believes deeply in social justice, come together to make our house strong again, because this house is the one that Eleftherios Venizelos founded and Andreas Papandreou re-founded in 1974. It is the house of democracy, it is the house of dignity, it is the house of hope, it is the house of perspective. Come together. Raise proudly the green flag of PASOK. Come together. May 21, may the sun of hope, the sun of social justice, the sun of individual dignity rise again. PASOK is here with each and every one of us as protagonists because we are a people's movement. All together we will fight the fight. All together, in every village, in every city, in every workplace. All together. We have only 6 days. Lift up the responsibility, lift up the need to re-embrace the struggles, the hopes. The patriotic movement of the democratic party is here to turn the page for our country, for a better future. Fight, fight, fight and on May 21 we will be victorious. May 21 the clocks of history turn back and show that the time of the people's movement has come, the time of the democratic party has come. Good strength and good fight.
