Friends and friends. Friends, the democratic party is here. PASOK is here. Our movement has returned dynamically to the political forefront of Greek history. Your presence tonight at Velideion confirms that on 21 May we are sending a message of victory, hope and perspective for all Greeks. For every democratic and progressive citizen, the return of the democratic party is now clearly a fact. In every part of the country, in every meeting, I see smiles, hope and need everywhere. We are embracing again the struggles of the vulnerable and the middle class. We are becoming the people-born movement founded in 1974, the movement of great change and great reform. We are the party that changed Greece, that made it truly believe in itself, to become more democratic, more creative, more powerful, to make leaps of hope, growth, progress and prosperity. This party brought the people to power, inspired the younger generations and offered equal opportunities for advancement, creating for all Greeks a strong, undivided middle class. That is why our political opponents have intensified their attacks on us in recent days as they see our political opponents, the people's league of the democratic party, attacking us above and below the table. And of course, together with them and the interests that support them, who daily slander our stance, they devalue the decision that you have taken together, all together, for an autonomous course away from commitments, away only for conflicts, away from enslavement to powerful interests, with autonomy of conflict to really bring the great changes that the Greek people need.
