Friends, yes, we have a front, we have a front with all of them. Because, quite simply, we have a front against authoritarianism and misery in public debate. We have a front against the organised gangs of the Internet. We have a front against those who, for the sake of the chair, for the sake of power, are capable of saying the same and the opposite and sacrificing the public interest of the Greek people. Friends, they have the audacity to play with the memory of Andreas Papandreou, our founder. Let us make it clear from here. Let us make it clear here in Thessaloniki. Andreas Papandreou, who belongs to the history of the democratic, progressive history of this country. Andreas Papandreou, Mr Tsipras, cannot be exploited by those who talk about dangerous theories about Prespes and the Aegean. Andreas Papandreou and the patriotic PASOK do not go hand in hand with the Aegean Prespes, Mr Tsipras. Andreas Papandreou and this patriotic people's movement are not going with the dangerous theories that there are no borders at sea. So leave our founder, our historical leader, the greatest politician of Greece since the Second World War, Andreas Papandreou, alone in history. This political giant has nothing to do with your dangerous adventurism. But he has the audacity to lecture us on how New Democracy will fall. Who? Its major sponsor, who every week will say something to give Mr Mitsotakis a field to run on. On the one hand, local currencies, on the other, the Evros fence, which they suddenly say yes, but that European taxpayers should not pay for it. Admittedly, this is the big issue for Syriza and various other things that simply show a need. Fight every day on 21 May to have its real opponent, New Democracy, because with Mr Tsipras and his company, Mr Mitsotakis feels completely safe.
