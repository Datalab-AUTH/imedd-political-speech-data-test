Do you remember what was happening in the last few years here in Thessaloniki? A field of conflict. Where are the university police? You paid for it, you paid for Mr Mitsotakis' university police with your taxes. Where is it today? There is no university police. Why hasn't what we said happened? The simple. What are they doing all over Europe? They're putting in university security companies. Cameras in the laboratories, which are expensive machines paid for by the Greek taxpayer, and when there is an offence at the university, the normal police enter, as they do in every other place in Greece, without it being a sanctuary. It is a sanctuary of ideas, it is a sanctuary of research, it is a sanctuary of dignity; the Greek university is not a field of ideological clashes between New Democracy and Syriza at the expense of Greek students.
