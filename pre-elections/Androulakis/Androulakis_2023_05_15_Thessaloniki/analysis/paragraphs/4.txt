Mr Mitsotakis thinks that the people are forgetting the history of his family, with its history of defections, its history of games, its history of parastatism. We are in 2023 and no democrat progressive citizen can bear such a downfall for our country, a European country. PASOK will not become a crutch for anyone because it has deep historical and social roots. Mr Mitsotakis is also trying to hit us politically by saying that we are statists, that we are not the progressive modernisers, implying that he is the progressive moderniser. However, and I urge the Greek people to remember that he is such a progressive moderniser that if we put his and his family's buffers in a row, they exceed the length of the Great Wall of China. This is the reality, Mr Mitsotakis, we have a memory as Greek people, we have a memory of who they are and which families have created political dowries by buffoonery at the expense of the public interest.
