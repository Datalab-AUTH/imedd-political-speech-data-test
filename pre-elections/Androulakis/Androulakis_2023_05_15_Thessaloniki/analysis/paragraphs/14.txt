Friends. But what should we do? We must find a public space and create the conditions for a just development. For dividends. We cannot follow the policy of the New Democracy. The New Republic put a 5% across the board. And I start from this because there has been a very big discussion about where the parties will get the money and Mr Mitsotakis even proposes that we take our programmes to the general accounting office of the state. We say to the Budget Office of the House of Representatives. Let us see who is telling the truth.  But let us start from the simple. Why 5% on dividends? What does the 2022 data say? 150 listed companies have quadrupled their profits when in '22 the weakest Greek and the middle class were impoverished. This policy cannot continue to coddle the domestic oligarchy. Despite the energy crisis and high inflation, they will distribute a record dividend of two and a half billion euros.
