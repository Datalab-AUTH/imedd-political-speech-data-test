But, friends, let's go to our programme that wants to give a new breath to the Greek economy. The programme, the social democratic programme, the programme of Democratic Socialism, the programme that reduces inequalities and creates opportunities and hopes for all Greek children, for all families. One promises things that cannot be done and the other hides what is going to happen with his budgetary choices. They boast about growth, about good statistics, when in reality our performance is unfortunately negative, as the OECD figures show. More than two and a half million Greeks are currently threatened with poverty and social exclusion, according to official figures. They praise that they reduced taxes, but the taxes paid by citizens in 2022 were 5 billion more than the targets. If this is not overtaxation, what is it? And even more so if we put on the table that most of these taxes are due to VAT consumption and special taxes that beat up the weakest, the workers, the unemployed and the middle class. They say they have increased the minimum wage by 20% and dispute the OECD figures of a 7.4% reduction in real wages. Unemployment, they say, is falling, but the new jobs are mostly â‚¬400 part-time jobs. This growth that has Mr Mitsotakis' name on it is creating real estate with internal loans. In a few years, with this policy, we will be foreigners in our country. Students will not be able to rent a house with dignity in the centre of Thessaloniki and the centre of Athens. Young couples will not be able to build their future with dignity and have children. And on the other hand, Mr Tsipras thinks that the economy is a cow that gives out milk without ever being fed.
