Friends, before I closed on small and medium-sized enterprises, I heard Mr Mitsotakis say, but why are you asking for 120 instalments? We did it. So ask your friends in Thessaloniki, the small and medium-sized enterprises, how many of them were able to join the 120 instalments that Mr Mitsotakis gave? To understand to what extent he disregards the real problems of the Greek economy. That is why I am committed to 120 instalments for everyone, both for the tax office and for the EFKA, and a 30% reduction in the capital for anyone who keeps their instalments to the end.
