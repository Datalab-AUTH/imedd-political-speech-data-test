Friends, demographics, the mother, the mother, the mother, the fighter of everyday life. This party has made it a priority to tackle the greatest national danger of our country, the demographic bomb. That is why I pledge that no child will be left in the coming years without a cr√®che and a creative activity centre, so that the Greek mother can continue her life as normal. Economic and social life. We also have a ready-made legislative initiative which we had submitted in the past, but which was rejected by the New Democracy, to strengthen the maternity allowance for mothers of freelance workers. This is another of our commitments to support the Greek mother. Finally, very crucially if you look at the OECD figures, a family with no children in Greece and a family with 2 children in Greece have a 3-point difference in taxation. Portugal has 10 points and other countries with a similar population have 8-9 points. I am committed that we will reduce the tax on every family with children to create strong tax incentives to address the demographics.
