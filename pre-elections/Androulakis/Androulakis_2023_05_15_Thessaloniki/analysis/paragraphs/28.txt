My friends, the small and medium-sized enterprises. The government touts the high GDP growth rates after the pandemic, but they are due to consumption and tourism. Because real productive foreign investment was only 14% of all foreign investment, with the rest being real estate and the acquisition of existing Greek businesses. The question is therefore relentless for Mr Mitsotakis: who has benefited from this growth strategy? Certainly not small and medium-sized enterprises, which remain on the sidelines. They are excluded from the favourable loans of the Recovery Fund. The evidence is inexorable. Its first 1.2 billion has been taken by 67 companies at 1.1% interest, not SMEs. What are we saying? The Recovery Fund should have a special financial institution that will finance SMEs beyond market criteria, with digital criteria, with convergence criteria, environmental criteria, new jobs, so that people who cannot get into banks can borrow from this financial institution. Portugal has already done this.
