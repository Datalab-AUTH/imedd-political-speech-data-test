This state is undermining the efforts and sacrifices of the Greek people. This is the state that led to Tempe. This is the state that the Transparency Authority pointed to in October 21 for the huge responsibilities for not having a telecommunications system, and this is the state that Mr Karamanlis hid in his drawer so that they would not be brought to justice. And instead of going home he is decorating the ballot papers of the New Democracy in Serres. This is political ethics and this is contempt for the families of the victims of Tempi.
