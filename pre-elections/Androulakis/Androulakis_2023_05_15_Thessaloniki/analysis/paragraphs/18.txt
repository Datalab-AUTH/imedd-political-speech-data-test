Parental benefits. From here, from the TIF, Mr Mitsotakis said and did. Because whatever he says about the powerful, he does. The people, the middle class, he deliberately mocks. So he said 800,000 euros per parent. And 800,000 euros per grandparent. 4.8 million euros tax-free on parental benefits for each child. Which middle-class child, which child of a vulnerable Greek family is affected by the transfer of wealth up to 4.8 million euros without tax, Mr Mitsotakis? In which Greece are you pursuing these policies in Greece where hundreds of thousands of young Greek children have left for a better day abroad? So much for that.
