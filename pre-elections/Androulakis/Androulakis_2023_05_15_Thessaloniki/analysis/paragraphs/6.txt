The left that is at the heart and soul of the democratic party is the rule of law, respect for human rights and the separation of powers. PASOK is here, comrades. Friends, PASOK is here to embrace the progressive Left, the progressive centre and the aspirations of every democratic citizen, away from the discord, away from the toxic conflicts that are pinning down the future of our country. But what are progressive forces, to recall the events of a little earlier? Are the ones who shouted Hangmen in the Constitution and compared the elected Prime Minister of the country, George Papandreou, with Pinochet, the dictator of Chile, progressive forces? Or was it? Or are they progressive forces who in the '15 election said to the people don't pay your loans, here we come. We will bring stubbornness. And they also said no house in the hands of a banker and they brought electronic auctions, reduction of first home protection and sold billions of euros of red loans in '15 to blackmail the weakest citizens. The crows of the funds. This is the Left and Mr Tsipras' progress here is the Left of protecting the first home. This is the Left that is standing in the way of the de-fellatinisation of the Greek economy.
