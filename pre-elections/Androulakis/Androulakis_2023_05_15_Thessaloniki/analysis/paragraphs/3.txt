In the last twenty-four hours, Mr Mitsotakis has really shown who has a personal obsession. He is trying to convince the PASOK cadres, the friends of PASOK, the voters of PASOK, that I am leading you into a blind front against New Democracy. But the truth is one. That in the last few days there has been nesting within it the anxiety and fear that what is being born, the new one, will be the real opponent. It will be the democratic party of serious opposition, of the programme, of perspective, and not the cheap populism of Mr Tsipras. Because Mr Mitsotakis knows very well in his heart that if it were not for Tsipras, his government would already be a thing of the past in the minds of the Greek people. Friends, he is looking for a life jacket. He knows that the only lifeline is the Greek people's previous experience of 15-19 with Tsipras and Kammenos. I imagine he would want another PASOK and not this PASOK, the current PASOK. He wanted a subordinate PASOK, but all of you 200,000, 270,000 democratic citizens sent him a strong message on 12 December and I call on all the Greek people to send him a new message on 21 May.
