Friends, I can't help but mention national issues after yesterday's Turkish elections. If there is one thing that Mr Erdogan and Mr Kilicdaroglu agree on, it is the constant questioning of our sovereign rights. Unfortunately, the government and the official opposition are handling all these serious foreign policy issues in terms of communication. Last March, when, after a lunch with Mr Erdogan on the Bosphorus, Mr Mitsotakis was celebrating a new era in Greek-Turkish relations. We also saw it with Albania the day before yesterday. A few months ago, Mr Mitsotakis visited Northern Epirus, and the Albanian Prime Minister admired him. And yet, three days before the municipal elections, we saw the imprisonment of the expatriate mayor of Himarra, Freddy Beleri, who, despite the adversity and terror of the Albanian authorities, managed to win and we congratulate him here from Thessaloniki for showing that nothing can prevent the right of the Greek minority of Northern Epirus.
