On the one hand, Mr Tsipras cannot even utter the word PASOK, but on the other hand he is giving us history lessons. He said yesterday that Andreas Papandreou had never said that he had no front with the progressive forces. And I ask him, are Antonaros and the Kammenos orphans who filled his ballot papers progressive forces? Or is it a progressive front the digital parasite run by Koumoundourou that attacks political opponents, accusing them one day of being taken and the next of being blackmailed. It is the leader of a digital parasite that had no moral bottom to target a young woman, a comrade who reported her abuse. If this is the left, then Mr Tsipras is living in Latin America.
