So it is time for us, the democratic party, to put an end to these outdated models of power and create a broad social alliance for a strong Greece of the future, so that we can become a normal European country again. This is our vision, a normal European country that respects the citizen, respects the environment and that growth is sustainable and socially just for all Greeks. We have a duty to build a modern welfare state with high-quality benefits and services, not a youth pass. Mr Mitsotakis cannot disregard the young generation in this way, a young generation with few opportunities and many skills, and just before the elections try to buy consciences with EUR 150. This shows the quality of New Democracy's politics.
