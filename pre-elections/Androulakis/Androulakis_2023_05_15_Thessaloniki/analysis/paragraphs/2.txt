Friends. But I want to confide something to you here from Thessaloniki. In the last few hours I am almost bursting with sadness. After Mr Mitsotakis' statements that he has nothing to say to PASOK. Mr Mitsotakis, I and all of us, all democrats, all progressive citizens, have nothing to say to the eavesdropping parastate. We have nothing to do with the leader of the Patsis who speculated with red loans at the expense of the poorest Greeks. The people have not forgotten what the Right means, so they are rebirthing its real opponent and not its sponsor, Mr Tsipras. Friends, what do we have to say to the champion of direct assignments, the champion of postponements, the champion of widespread corruption? What do we have to say to the champion of inequalities, the champion of the grafting of the Greek economy?
