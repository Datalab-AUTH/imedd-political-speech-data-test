Friends, but the elephant in the room is Turkey, let's be honest. We want a stable neighbouring country, but we also need a unified European foreign policy, a policy based on respect for international law and not a policy that coddles Turkey, making it feel unchecked and unconstrained. But the Greek borders are not only Greek, they are also Euro-Turkish, and I think it is unfair that we Greeks should pay billions of euros to guard our borders and those of the rest of Europe. It is a huge disadvantage for the rule of law, sorry for the welfare state, when we give billions for armaments, something that the Danes, the Dutch, the Germans and other central Europeans do not do. What needs to be done? I have said it many times. Unified armaments. The European army, like Frontex, which guards the Greek borders, has become a European army, just as the Europeans have to put their hand in their pockets and for the fence on the Evros, they have to put their hand deep in their pockets to pay for the guarding of the Greek-Turkish border. And let them learn a lesson from the events in Ukraine. It is unfair for the Greek people to pay billions in armaments without co-productions, without the prospect of a common defence and foreign policy.
