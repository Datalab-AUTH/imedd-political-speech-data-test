Pensioners. What do we propose? You hear about billions of euros of pensions. They feed everything. Our program is 1.13 billion. What is it? Support for the weakest pensioners. The ESAS that Mr Tsipras abolished, we are bringing it back as a new ESAS for 350,000 low pensioners who are in despair. We abolish from 1/01/24 the personal difference, and finally, change the law of the New Democracy and SYRIZA to increase the contributory pension and abolish the unfair provisions on disability and widow's pensions. These 3 fair options are 1.13 billion and not 6 or 10 billion as New Democracy and Syriza are trolling by knowingly mocking pensioners.
