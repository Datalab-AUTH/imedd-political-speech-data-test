Finally, whatever government emerges in Turkey, Europe has a duty to stop sending even one bullet to Turkey. As long as it continues its policy of violating neighbouring sovereign rights. The arms embargo. I do not often hear the arms embargo from either Mr Mitsotakis or Mr Tsipras, because they go and do public relations. The arms embargo is not a nationalist choice of a patriotic movement like PASOK. It is the Europe of peoples, it is the Europe of solidarity, where no European can arm a country that is breaking the law against another people from the 27.
