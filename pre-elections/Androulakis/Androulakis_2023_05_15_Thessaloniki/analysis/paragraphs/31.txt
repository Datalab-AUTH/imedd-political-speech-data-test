For our Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki can become the capital of the Balkans. We have been saying this for many years, but we can do it if there is a strategy for developing its potential and exploiting its geostrategic position. Of course, always by linking it with neighbouring countries. But the current reality is unfortunately not what we want. It deprives the country of GDP, jobs, wealth and takes away our potential economic openness. We need to focus on speeding up the implementation of the city's infrastructure, because unfortunately Thessaloniki is lagging behind. Metro and airport connections to the western districts, flood protection works, vertical axes with the Egnatia Odos, the regional road, new school facilities and health centres in the city. PASOK's priority is first and foremost the city's urban transport system, which has been in an unacceptable state for many years. A permanently ailing OASÎ˜ without vehicles and drivers that cannot cope with the great transport task of the time.
