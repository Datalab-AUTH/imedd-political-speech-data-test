Friends, education. There is no other tool for social democrats, for a society of social mobility, for a society of low inequalities, if there is no strong public education. So what do we propose? A national baccalaureate. There is a huge talk about the base 10. Is that the only problem? Mr Tsipras is trying to fish in murky waters. Did any young people hear that no exams will get them into universities. But I must tell the restless youth that nowhere in the world do they get into universities without any exams at all. Let Mr Tsipras drop the mockery. No more mockery for young people too. It is a disgrace to not honour the young people of our country. So what is the national diploma? A national baccalaureate is not judging your future on an exam, with all that it means for the psychology of the student and the family. It is decided in the last 2 years by multiple exams and post-university options, where not only one exam but also the grade of the diploma plays an important role. What is the goal of this change? To take the focus off of tutoring and put the focus back on public school so that all students have adequate knowledge, adequate skills, and are competitive with a future perspective. Friends, and of course, with strong remedial teaching for all. And finally, strong special education structures everywhere. Only in this way will a socialist party create an inclusive school and all children of all Greeks will be able to participate equally with any learning difficulties in this strong public school. It is our commitment, as is the increase in teachers' salaries and real evaluation, not evaluation by second-raters, as imposed by the New Democracy party-state. Friends, outward-looking universities. What does an extroverted university mean? It is a university that is linked to innovation, to research, a university without family rule, a university that does not argue about the university police.
