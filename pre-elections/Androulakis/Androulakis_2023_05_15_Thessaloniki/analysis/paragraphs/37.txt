Friends, there are only 6 days left. I am addressing all generations here from Thessaloniki and I am really happy because all generations are here today. It is the generation of 114, it is the generation of the founding of PASOK, it is the generation of the 1980s, it is the generation of the 1990s and it is the generation that will renew and make the democratic party a protagonist again. So I am addressing every democrat and every progressive who believes deeply in the rule of law, who believes deeply in respect, in human rights, who believes deeply in sustainable development, who believes deeply in social justice, come together to make our house strong again, because this house is the one that Eleftherios Venizelos founded and Andreas Papandreou re-founded in 1974. It is the house of democracy, it is the house of dignity, it is the house of hope, it is the house of perspective. Come together. Raise proudly the green flag of PASOK. Come together. May 21, may the sun of hope, the sun of social justice, the sun of individual dignity rise again. PASOK is here with each and every one of us as protagonists because we are a people's movement. All together we will fight the fight. All together, in every village, in every city, in every workplace. All together. We have only 6 days. Lift up the responsibility, lift up the need to re-embrace the struggles, the hopes. The patriotic movement of the democratic party is here to turn the page for our country, for a better future. Fight, fight, fight and on May 21 we will be victorious. May 21 the clocks of history turn back and show that the time of the people's movement has come, the time of the democratic party has come. Good strength and good fight.
