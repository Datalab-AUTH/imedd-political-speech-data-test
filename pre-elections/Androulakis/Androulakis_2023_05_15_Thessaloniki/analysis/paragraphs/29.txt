Friends, for sustainable development, with environmental protection, we need to change the energy model. We need a Greek national development that will invest in Made in Greece. What is Made in Greece? It is to know every year how many of the millions of travelers who came to Greece consume domestic Greek products, so that not only the islands and tourism win, but the whole Greek economy wins, the wines, the oil, the processed agri-food products, so that we strengthen exports and create good jobs throughout Greece. We are also proposing a three-year exemption from capital gains tax for new business clusters created by networking and partnerships, special funding, funding lines from the NSRF for the relocation of medium-sized enterprises to organised craft parks, special funding lines from the Recovery Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises' investments in innovation, energy adaptation, digital transformation. Finally, the creation of product development centres in the regions to provide technical assistance, standardisation planning for the development of new products and their distribution networks.
