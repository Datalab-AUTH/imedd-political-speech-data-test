Health. I can't not mention health because the child of PASOK is the National Health System. We made it, we are committed to revive it. It is the child of George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos. It is the child of the need to have public health services so that our country can stop being the third country in Europe in private spending. Only Bulgaria and Lithuania surpass Greece in health care costs. What are we saying? We from the Recovery Fund say not 2-4% like New Democracy, but 8-10% so that we build strong primary care that reaches the home of the Greek in every case. Also, staffing hospitals with 15,000 permanent medical staff of 15,000 doctors, and raising the salaries of all health workers to the European Union average. We also need to introduce social, economic and scientific incentives to stop the understaffing of hospitals in the periphery. Finally. A commitment that many have said, but no one has made: inclusion in the heavy and unhealthy work of health workers to end the pandemic clapping. We have a duty to do it and we will do it.
