Also central to our commitment to young people is our social housing programme. Rents are soaring in all urban centres. Mr Mitsotakis has made a programme, we have just started talking about social housing, which does not give low-rent houses, it gives low-interest loans to buy a house based on the price per square metre. Very few people will have access to that policy. We don't want to build new property. We want the state to own property, plus houses closed - in Thessaloniki there are about 15,000 - that will open with zero ENVIA and incentives for reconstruction from the Recovery Fund. What does this mean? An aggregate of 150,000 homes across Greece, in urban centres with social criteria, students, young couples. When you can stand on your own two feet, you leave and someone else comes in, so this will help not only 150,000 young couples but hundreds of thousands of Greeks who are desperate because of the cost of living. Our priority is to bring the cost of living down immediately, because Greece is a country with low wages and a huge comparative cost of living for Greeks.
