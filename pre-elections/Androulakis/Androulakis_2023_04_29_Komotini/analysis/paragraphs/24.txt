But of course we also need to reach out to new investments, especially in the agri-food sector, so that many good jobs can be created. For us it is a priority to link tourism with agri-food. So that when 20 million tourists come to Greece, it is not only the hoteliers on the islands and in the specific regions who celebrate, but the whole Greek economy. And how are we going to achieve this? If, with measurable targets, we achieve a large percentage of these 20.25 million people taste Greek products, processed Greek agricultural products for as long as they are in Greece, so that they look for them on the shelves in Europe during the remaining months of the year, and so that from tourism we are not just a huge hotel as a country, but a real economy that benefits the entire Greek people, both in Rhodes and Crete and in Central Greece and in Thessaly and Thrace.
