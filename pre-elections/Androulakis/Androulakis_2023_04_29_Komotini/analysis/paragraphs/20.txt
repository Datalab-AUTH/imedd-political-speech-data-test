Friends. Here in Komotini I cannot fail to mention the new price contract we want to sign. With the Greek and the Greek farmer. You know very well that the agricultural sector, the only one that has supported it over time, is our party. But in the right way and not with the mistakes of the past. So that is why we have the priority of reducing production costs. Especially for agricultural inputs, animal feed, fuel by zeroing the excise duty on agricultural oil for the entire duration of the energy crisis. And of course with permanent policies on production costs, it is unthinkable here in Thrace, with the very large areas that exist, that there is not a strong policy of green, fair, energy transition, that is, that hundreds of farmers, livestock farmers, processors, cooperatives can make municipalities energy communities. I know all too well the energy reservoir that this place has. And so through renewable energy sources they can have a fixed production cost, that is, they can consume the energy they produce themselves and the surplus can be sold back to the grid and thus benefit their investment and the local community.
