Friends. You know very well that a big part of the cost of living for students in many parts of Greece is rent, why is it rent? That nowadays, because of the rampant use of short-term rentals, without criteria, without conditions, without framework in urban centres, as is the case in other major European capitals or cities. And without having social housing programmes, you have left the poorest Greeks at the mercy of the rapidly rising cost of living in relation to housing. So that's why, by imitating models of other countries with socialist governments, democratic governments. I say we need to build a social housing program, a pool of 150,000 homes that are either newly built through the Recovery Fund. I want you to understand the evidence and Mr Mitsotakis' disdain for this problem. In newly built homes from the Recovery Fund. The Portuguese did 20,000. The Spanish did 11,000. The new democracy included 70 houses in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. This is contempt for the real problems of the people. So we say. Either newer in the Recovery Fund, or with tax incentives or incentives to build. Open up the closed houses in all the major cities of the country, join the social housing, the tank at low rent, so that 150,000 families and students can have cheap and decent housing in the coming years. These schemes are happening all over Europe. I see no reason why they should not also happen in Greece so that there is decent housing that will lead to a drop in overall rents in the country. And not to new ownership, as Mr Mitsotakis suggests.
