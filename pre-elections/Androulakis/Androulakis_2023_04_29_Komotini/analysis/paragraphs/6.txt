Also the institutions. We imagined in 2023 that Mr. Mitsotakis's nephew would set up a spying parastatal to monitor the candidate for leader of the Third Democratic Party. ...that would be monitoring the six heads of the armed forces. His ministers? And instead of those responsible being brought to justice. And to the committee of the competent parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Mitsotakis obviously because he fears for himself. He put the case in total darkness, covering up one of the biggest scandals of the post-war era. And not only that. He is, he says, a liberal and a democrat, but he is doing what Mr. Tsipras did when he denounced him last term. Mr Georgiades' personal attacks on the heads of the independent authorities. The independent authorities that ensure throughout Europe democracy, transparency and the human rights of all Greek citizens, without discrimination. Those authorities that PASOK established in 2003 to guarantee the rule of law. In the same way that they attacked under SYRIZA, when they did not like their findings, the gentlemen of the new democracy are attacking in the same way, because they obviously feared that Mr Rammos, Mr Menoudakos, with the work they are doing, will lead not to a cover-up, but to the exposure of this scandal.
