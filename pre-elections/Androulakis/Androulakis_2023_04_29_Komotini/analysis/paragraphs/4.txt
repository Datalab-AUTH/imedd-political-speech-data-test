When we are witnessing unbelievable corruption. Phenomena of contempt for the intelligence of citizens, phenomena of contempt for institutions. That's where PASOK is. It is our duty to stand in the way of Mr Mitsotakis' incredible arrogance. The arrogance that only yesterday we learned what we all imagined. That the excellence that the secretary said has set up a mechanism that exploits our taxes to build a political empire. So listen, please, what happened yesterday? 74. Probably 44 of the 74 members of the New Democracy Electoral Commission. They are members of agencies, boards of directors of agencies, temporary employees, presidents of general agencies, secretaries general of ministries. What does this mean? It means that we are paying for his scales all over Greece to collect votes for Mr Mitsotakis out of our own pockets. That is where their audacity has reached, that they do not respect the fact that we are going into an election campaign and that each party alone, with respect for the institutions and transparency, must fight its own battle. The arrogance of the aristocrats. A client state.
