The conclusion of the tragedy of Tempe is out. We've been talking for months, weeks, about the partisan appointment of the controversial OSE employee of the stationmaster. And we were told, it's a legal transfer. The very committee appointed by Mr. Mitsotakis, this three-member committee responded that the transfer was not legal. It was illegal. That is why the judiciary took the initiative yesterday against the management of the OSE. Also the 717 contract, which led to the tragedy. Is it possible for a minister to be on the New Democracy ballot paper? Who, in response to our Member's question in the Greek Parliament about whether he has received since October 21, a year and a half before the tragedy. The finding of the independent transparency authority proving that certain persons under SYRIZA and New Democracy, since 14 when the contract was signed, led to 7 transfers of delivery of the project. The project went from EUR 44 million to EUR 55 million, all European money. While in this conclusion there are, the persons involved in the delay, who did not implement the project and brought the tragedy. If we had had the telecommunications, this tragedy would have been avoided. This minister did nothing, he did not know, says the finding. It was in his drawer but he didn't know. Why should he take it to justice and instead of being accountable today he is on the New Democracy ballot paper in Serres.
