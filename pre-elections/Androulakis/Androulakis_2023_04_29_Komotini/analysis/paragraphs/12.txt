Here, then, is a simple dilemma. Do you want politics with ethics? Do you want politics with consistency and dignity? That speaks the language of truth. Justice everywhere tells me and believes it. And no justice for everyone else except the party cronies of the Prime Minister of the day. He wants meritocracy. Who wants these guys to believe in politics again or look at us the same for all the years to come with half an eye, believing that all politicians are protagonists of buffoonery and offer nothing but big talk. So I am here to put up a fight. To make young people believe again that politics can provide solutions, that they can participate with their opinions with dignity, touching their dreams and hopes for the future, to stay here in Greece, to have families with dignified jobs, to study in our universities. Not to finish university and search the Internet. To find out in which city in Europe they will build their future? What is the future of the country that is turning its children away? No future? We will be an ageing Greece of a much smaller population of 10 million. So that is what we are in debt for. To build a justice, a country with justice and perspective. And above all for the young generation. Because I believe that if the young generation does not stand on its feet, the young generation will never stand on its feet, our country will never stand on its feet. So let's leave big talk in the past. Let us be realistic, because I ask you to trust me.
