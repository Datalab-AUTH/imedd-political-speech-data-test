I can't imagine being convicted 13-0 by the Special Court. And saying justice everywhere and then instead of sending him home I have him on my ballot. I can't imagine. The cover-up. The denigration. And the disrespect for justice and institutions. And I say that personally. This is the historical legacy of the Andreas Papandreou movement. That he took a Greece of the few, which despised the many, where there was no justice, where there was no respect for the individual, where there was discrimination based on religion and political identity, and made it the Greece of all Greeks. This is the great dowry of PASOK. This is the great dowry of the democratic party.
