Friends, it is not only the institutions, behaviour is also the economy. Mr Mitsotakis tells us that he has reduced tax rates. Let's look at the figures, some rates have been reduced. The weak and the middle class are gaining, but much less from his tax policy than the oligarchs of the country are gaining and profiting. And that is not social justice. It is not social justice, to be able to transfer, without parental benefit tax, up to 4.8 million euros of property and mobile phones to your child and grandchild. Whereas it could be a ceiling of 200, 400,000 for the weak and the middle class. But at the same time, when they have such tax breaks, the powerful of the country. And we say: lower VAT on basic goods. That's what other governments in Europe are doing. Tackle obscenity, tackle the price rise in the middle of an energy crisis. Is this populism? Mr Mitsotakis labels as populism whatever he thinks does not help him in his political plans. But it is legitimate and there is no money centre at a time when he is putting his hand in our pockets. In the pocket of the middle class of the Greek people of the weak citizens to support the big power generators,who please made billions more in between the energy crisis than in previous years.
