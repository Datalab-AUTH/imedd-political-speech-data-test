Friends. Finally, we also have a duty to invest in the natural resources of water. You farmers know very well that the next few years will be difficult and it is very likely that, just as we have been talking about energy this year, we will be talking about water in a few years' time. What we have to do not to make the same mistake that we made with energy and I want to be precise. Some people from Syriza and New Democracy cannot say. What should we do? The war in Ukraine happened. There was Putin's illegal and brutal invasion and that brought the energy crisis. That is not so and do you know why it is not so? Why this war? It has an influence in other countries in Europe and in Portugal. But why did the Portuguese get exemptions that Greece did not get? It is because they are energy blocked because of the Pyrenees. But we are also energy-locked because of the Balkans. What is it that made them better managed? It is because about 60 per cent of electricity generation in Portugal is renewable energy.
