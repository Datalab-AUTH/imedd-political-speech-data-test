Friends and friends, all this is not just talk. They are our priorities, they are our projects, they are our values, our positions and our ideas. So this flag. Of ideas, positions and values. I invite you to raise it together on May 21 this struggle. This struggle is not a party struggle. It is a struggle that concerns the candidates. The county committees. It is a patriotic national social struggle. And that's exactly why; we have a huge debt. On the 21st, every democratically progressive Greek citizen should feel that PASOK's home is open again to embrace the struggles of the Greek people, to defend the public interest. To defend the interests of the homeland. So that is why I want you to fight a struggle for dignity. A strong, daily fight. I do not expect anything from the domestic oligarchy, because quite simply what we say does not serve their interests. but I expect a lot from those who what we say changes their lives, and that is all of you. so take in your hands the struggle of the democratic party have a few days left in every village, in every city, in every university, in every workplace. Let us speak the word of progress, of change, of dignity and of hope, the word of the strong democratic party founded by Andreas Papandreou, the democratic party of hope and perspective. Raise high the flag of social justice and national dignity. Victory is ours. The victory is great. May 21, the country turns the page be well and good luck to us. Thank you very much.
