I'm really happy because I see all generations here. Old friends. Comrades. People who started our student years together in the PASP. Who fought for a strong public university. We fought a struggle against preservation, all forms of preservation. Conservation that wanted the university. A supposed sanctuary of ideas, but without allowing the democracy of pluralism of ideas. Forces that wanted the university, a family-based mechanism for the selection of persons by certain mechanisms at the expense of the meritocracy of transparency. Forces that did not understand. That the great value of our party is the power of change. The power of justice, the power of democracy.
