Friends, it is a real thrill for me to be here today in the city that I know every single alley because in Xanthi and Komotini I spent the most important years of my life, my student years. I got attached to the people, to the mentality, to the culture, to the history. And the multiculturalism of a jewel of Greece, which is our Thrace.
