Friends. Cost of living. Education. That is a big issue and it's not just universities that many people are talking about it's also primary education that has collapsed in our country. So that's why we have to mainly give a foundation in primary education. I think that the best system we have to follow is a uniform system, which will give a national baccalaureate. So that the national exams are abolished. Every child should choose at their school and take exams there so that it is an informed choice, study and not a choice based on their family's financial ability. The older ones know. The great power of public education in the 80s. That gave the public university the opportunity for the child of the farmer's child of the cattle farmer in Komotini to study to be a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, to stay at home and raise a family. Today, the cost of living, the cost of studies, the cost of tutorials makes children choose on their computerised form not on the basis of their real ambition sometimes, but on the basis of the financial capacity of the family. The PASOK, this huge social injustice against the younger generation is not tolerated and will stand in the way by completely changing the way of school selection. And of course, remedial teaching in our schools. To reduce inequalities and to reduce tutoring. And strengthening special education structures to truly create an inclusive school.
