This is Europe. Europe is not just a currency, it is respect for the value of democracy. The institutions of transparency and above all human rights. So that is why, if these violations continue, Europe must stop arming the neighbouring country. I say this because this is a pragmatic policy that offers solutions without words that have no content, but only by looking at the ballot box at the next elections. If PASOK, with all its leaders, has succeeded in having a credible stance on these major issues, the national issues, it is because it has never had its eyes on the ballot box, but its eyes on the future of our people's homeland, the geopolitical security of the country and the vision of Europe, solidarity and perspective.
