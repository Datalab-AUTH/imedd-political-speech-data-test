Is that all? I heard Mr Mitsotakis say a few days ago: vote for me because Mr Androulakis said twice that I asked him to see me and he did not see me. He wants to say that my rudeness must be an incentive for you to vote for new democracy. So I want to give you another incentive to vote for PASOK. Seriousness and ethics. If my own press spokesman, Mr Mantzios, had insulted the New Democracy party in public in front of hundreds of citizens in his constituency, he would have been sent to Mr Mitsotakis' house and not to the ballot box in Lamia. That is our cultural and our difference. Therefore, lessons in civility to your party and not to the democratic party of Andreas Papandreou.
