So let us now look to the future. Why PASOK? Beyond our history and the struggles of yesterday in the proud struggles. And I am really touched to see here the generations of 114 and the founding of 1974, the generations that in the difficult years stayed with the party and kept it alive so that we can take it in our hands and make it great again. To the next. In the next election, friends. In the next election. We have commitments. The specific commitments. Commitments that make people's lives better. That turn the page. So that's why I'm talking about programmatic convergences. It is not a novelty, in most countries in Europe there are coalition governments. But it is not an exchange of ministries. It is not a power-sharing in the background anymore with programmatic agreements. Indeed Tsipras. Now he likes that concept. Why does he see that he has no chance? And he says that the very good German social democrats are the same ones he thought were despicable a few months ago because they were in coalition with the CDU. So we are talking about programmatic agreements and convergence at the forefront.  The first priority is the cost of living. So that is why we believe that we have to build a new welfare state. The greatest cost of living in our time is health care, education. Rent, daily inelastic costs.
