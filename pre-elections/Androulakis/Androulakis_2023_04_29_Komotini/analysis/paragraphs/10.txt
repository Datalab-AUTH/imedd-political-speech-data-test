So that's why we say that all these political choices which were decided because the Greek people have experience. They know what we are, they know who has said a lot and done little, who has only made mistakes or who has made mistakes like us, but they have also delivered a huge amount of work. This project, of great infrastructure. Which I remember coming here, in Thrace, to make four and a half hours with my family from the port of Thessaloniki, whereas now it is less than half that. The projects, the major infrastructure in Thrace have the stamp of the Democratic Party, because we are the party of brave regional development. We are the party that invested in local government, that invested in projects throughout Greece.
