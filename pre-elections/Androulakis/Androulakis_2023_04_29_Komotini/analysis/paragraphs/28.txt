Turning to the politics of your region to go to the national? We have a duty to link the university to the local economy. I've been hearing it now for decades and some students even older than me even longer. What does that mean? It means real research. To link a university, the local economy must be in the university. Research programs must serve the strategic plans for regional development of the region. And not to be independent and hovering of the development priorities of the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.
