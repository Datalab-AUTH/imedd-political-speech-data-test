Why is this not happening? Because quite simply the New Democracy's answer is that the grid is not highly interconnected, so what will Greece do instead of making a fair green transition? Is it going to do green transition for the 5 oligarchs of the country? No, Mr Mitsotakis. And this unfair policy at the expense of the Greek people that for the next 15 years some people will speculate with billions on their backs. This party will stand in the way of the next government. If our people are strong, we will make the model of a just democratic transition that all developed European countries are following.
