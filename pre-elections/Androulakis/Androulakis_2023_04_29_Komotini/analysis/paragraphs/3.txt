So I am glad because I started my political career from this place. I have become President of the Democratic Party and I have a very great duty, but one that we all have to fulfil together. On 21 May, we must raise the PASOK sun again, the sun of justice, hope and prospects for every Greek, the flag of PASOK, social justice and national dignity. PASOK, as the Dear Secretary said, has come a long way and will go a long way, for one reason alone. Because at every critical turn in history it was the movement that ensured the public interest and the dignity of all the Greek people, addressing social inequalities and institutional respect.
