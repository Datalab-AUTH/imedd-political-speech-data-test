Friends and friends. This is the new democracy. But why hasn't the new democracy fallen? Eavesdropping, scandals, Patchids buying the loans of the Greek people. Beer but to speculate at the expense of the citizens. Why hadn't the new democracy fallen? Because quite simply, the new democracy thinks that Tsipras' scarecrow will save it forever. That is why we are here to say to the Greek people from Komotini that the new democracy will go, but do not fear that Mr Tsipras and Mr Polakis will return, with what you experienced with the independent Greeks in 14 to 19 years - here is the choice of democracy, of perspective and of hope. So why is the fear of the Greek people unfair? It is not with what we lived through 14 to 19. Mr Tsipras used to come here in Thrace and say that he would tear up the memoranda; do not pay the red loans because I will bring my seismicity. I wanted to imitate the ancients. Pharaonic name Seisachthia. Mr. Tsipras's seysakhtha. He was just made prime minister at 15, to sell out with his law. And those who say that they were pressured by the Trojans, we answer them and the government of George Papandreou was pressured by the Trojans, but he brought in universal protection for first homes, not reducing protection and selling off red loans in worse conditions. So he sold off the red loans and suddenly the seismology becomes a blackmail table for thousands of borrowers. Thousands of households who are at risk of losing their homes. Who are being blackmailed by the funds, because the funds are simply not interested in the growth of the economy. They don't care about your loan arrangements, they're here to leave. They are interested in quick profit they took 5 to sell 15 they took 15 to sell 35. They don't care about sustainable growth.
