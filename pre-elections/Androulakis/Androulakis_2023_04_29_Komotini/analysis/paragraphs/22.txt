Finally for farmers, universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation. We have a duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinization of the Greek economy. Establishment of unconfiscated and tax-free subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers. Updating the ELGA insurance regulation to extend coverage of disasters to livestock and plant capital caused by climate change. But for the ministry I guess for the ministry the word "climate change" is a foreign word because you know very well that, there is no coverage for such disasters most of the time. And of course, as far as the programmes of the new common agricultural policy are concerned, they must be completed within a year, without the bureaucracy that exists today, which creates enormous inconvenience for farmers and livestock farmers and, of course, with specific dates for the submission of applications, evaluation and payment.
