Friends. Thrace has enormous potential. We have a duty to address not only the social inequalities in Greece that have escalated during the years of the economic and energy crisis, but also regional inequalities. Conditions have changed. There is Egnatia and its vertical axes. The new energy transmission networks to Europe are moving forward. Opportunities are being created to invest in extroversion, to turn our region into a centre and gateway to the Balkan and European hinterland, while at the same time reconstructing the economic life of the region and restoring social cohesion within the region. But this requires a long-term strategy, a plan and a national objective, regardless of the individuals and governments that everyone will consistently serve. Therefore, this issue is both national and developmental; the citizens of Thrace must stop feeling that they are living in a state of alienation from the administrative centre and that they have access to strong health and education services. Our plan includes generous tax incentives, financial, transport and wage content to increase the competitiveness of businesses in the region.
