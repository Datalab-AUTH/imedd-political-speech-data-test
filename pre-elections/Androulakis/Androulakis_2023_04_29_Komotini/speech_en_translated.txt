Friends, it is a real thrill for me to be here today in the city that I know every single alley because in Xanthi and Komotini I spent the most important years of my life, my student years. I got attached to the people, to the mentality, to the culture, to the history. And the multiculturalism of a jewel of Greece, which is our Thrace.

I'm really happy because I see all generations here. Old friends. Comrades. People who started our student years together in the PASP. Who fought for a strong public university. We fought a struggle against preservation, all forms of preservation. Conservation that wanted the university. A supposed sanctuary of ideas, but without allowing the democracy of pluralism of ideas. Forces that wanted the university, a family-based mechanism for the selection of persons by certain mechanisms at the expense of the meritocracy of transparency. Forces that did not understand. That the great value of our party is the power of change. The power of justice, the power of democracy.

So I am glad because I started my political career from this place. I have become President of the Democratic Party and I have a very great debt, but one that we must all fulfil together. On 21 May, we must once again raise the PASOK sun, the sun of justice, hope and prospects for every Greek, the flag of PASOK, social justice and national dignity. PASOK, as the Dear Secretary said, has come a long way and will go a long way, for one reason alone. Because at every critical turn in history it was the movement that ensured the public interest and the dignity of all the Greek people, addressing social inequalities and institutional respect.

When we are experiencing unbelievable corruption. Phenomena of contempt for the intelligence of citizens, phenomena of contempt for institutions. That's where PASOK is. It is our duty to stand in the way of Mr Mitsotakis' incredible arrogance. The arrogance that only yesterday we learned what we all imagined. That the excellence that the secretary said has set up a mechanism that exploits our taxes to build a political empire. So listen, please, what happened yesterday? 74. Probably 44 of the 74 members of the New Democracy Electoral Commission. They are members of agencies, boards of directors of agencies, temporary employees, presidents of general agencies, secretaries general of ministries. What does this mean? It means that we are paying for his scales all over Greece to collect votes for Mr Mitsotakis out of our own pockets. That is where their audacity has reached, that they do not respect the fact that we are going into an election campaign and that each party alone, with respect for the institutions and transparency, must fight its own battle. The arrogance of the aristocrats. A client state.

The conclusion of the tragedy of Tempe is out. We've been talking for months, weeks, about the partisan appointment of the controversial OSE employee of the stationmaster. And we were told, it's a legal transfer. The very committee appointed by Mr. Mitsotakis, this three-member committee responded that the transfer was not legal. It was illegal. That is why the judiciary took the initiative yesterday against the management of the OSE. Also the 717 contract, which led to the tragedy. Is it possible for a minister to be on the New Democracy ballot paper? Who, in response to our Member's question in the Greek Parliament about whether he has received since October 21, a year and a half before the tragedy. The finding of the independent transparency authority proving that certain persons under SYRIZA and New Democracy, since 14 when the contract was signed, led to 7 transfers of delivery of the project. The project went from EUR 44 million to EUR 55 million, all European money. While in this conclusion there are, the persons involved in the delay, who did not implement the project and brought the tragedy. If we had had the telecommunications, this tragedy would have been avoided. This minister did nothing, he did not know, says the finding. It was in his drawer but he didn't know. Why should he take it to justice and instead of being accountable today he is on the New Democracy ballot paper in Serres.

Also the institutions. We imagined in 2023 that Mr. Mitsotakis's nephew would set up a spying parastatal to monitor the candidate for leader of the Third Democratic Party. ...that would be monitoring the six heads of the armed forces. His ministers? And instead of those responsible being brought to justice. And to the committee of the competent parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Mitsotakis obviously because he fears for himself. He put the case in total darkness, covering up one of the biggest scandals of the post-war era. And not only that. He is, he says, a liberal and a democrat, but he is doing what Mr. Tsipras did when he denounced him last term. Mr Georgiades' personal attacks on the heads of the independent authorities. The independent authorities that ensure throughout Europe democracy, transparency and the human rights of all Greek citizens, without discrimination. Those authorities that PASOK established in 2003 to guarantee the rule of law. In the same way that they attacked under SYRIZA, when they did not like their findings, the gentlemen of the new democracy are attacking in the same way, because they obviously feared that Mr Rammos, Mr Menoudakos, with the work they are doing, will lead not to a cover-up, but to the exposure of this scandal.

Is that all? I heard Mr Mitsotakis say a few days ago: vote for me because Mr Androulakis said twice that I asked him to see me and he did not see me. He wants to say that my rudeness must be an incentive for you to vote for new democracy. So I want to give you another incentive to vote for PASOK. Seriousness and ethics. If my own press spokesman, Mr Mantzios, had insulted the New Democracy party in public in front of hundreds of citizens in his constituency, he would have been sent to Mr Mitsotakis' house and not to the ballot box in Lamia. That is our cultural and our difference. Therefore, lessons in civility to your party and not to the democratic party of Andreas Papandreou.

Friends, it is not only the institutions, behaviour is also the economy. Mr Mitsotakis tells us that he has reduced tax rates. Let's look at the figures, some rates have been reduced. The weak and the middle class are gaining, but much less from his tax policy than the oligarchs of the country are gaining and profiting. And that is not social justice. It is not social justice, to be able to transfer, without parental benefit tax, up to 4.8 million euros of property and mobile phones to your child and grandchild. Whereas it could be a ceiling of 200, 400,000 for the weak and the middle class. But at the same time, when they have such tax breaks, the powerful of the country. And we say: lower VAT on basic goods. That's what other governments in Europe are doing. Tackle obscenity, tackle the price rise in the middle of an energy crisis. Is this populism? Mr Mitsotakis labels as populism whatever he thinks does not help him in his political plans. But it is legitimate and there is no money centre at a time when he is putting his hand in our pockets. In the pocket of the middle class of the Greek people of the weak citizens to support the big power generators,who please made billions more in between the energy crisis than in previous years.

Friends and friends. This is the new democracy. But why hasn't the new democracy fallen? Eavesdropping, scandals, Patchids buying the loans of the Greek people. Beer but to speculate at the expense of the citizens. Why hadn't the new democracy fallen? Because quite simply, the new democracy thinks that Tsipras' scarecrow will save it forever. That is why we are here to say to the Greek people from Komotini that the new democracy will go, but do not fear that Mr Tsipras and Mr Polakis will return, with what you experienced with the independent Greeks in 14 to 19 years - here is the choice of democracy, of perspective and of hope. So why is the fear of the Greek people unfair? It is not with what we lived 14 to 19. Mr Tsipras used to come here in Thrace and say that he would tear up the memoranda; do not pay the red loans because I will bring my seismicity. I wanted to imitate the ancients. Pharaonic name Seisachthia. Mr. Tsipras's seysakhtha. He was just made prime minister at 15, to sell out with his law. And those who say that they were pressured by the Trojans, we answer them and the government of George Papandreou was pressured by the Trojans, but he brought in universal protection for first homes, not reducing protection and selling off red loans in worse conditions. So he sold off the red loans and suddenly the seismology becomes a blackmail table for thousands of borrowers. Thousands of households who are at risk of losing their homes. Who are being blackmailed by the funds, because the funds are simply not interested in the growth of the economy. They don't care about your loan arrangements, they're here to leave. They are interested in quick profit they took 5 to sell 15 they took 15 to sell 35. They don't care about sustainable growth.

So that's why we say that all these political choices which were decided because the Greek people have experience. They know what we are, they know who has said a lot and done little, who has only made mistakes or who has made mistakes like us, but they have also delivered a huge amount of work. This project, of great infrastructure. Which I remember coming here, in Thrace, to make four and a half hours with my family from the port of Thessaloniki, whereas now it is less than half that. The projects, the major infrastructure in Thrace have the stamp of the Democratic Party, because we are the party of brave regional development. We are the party that invested in local government, that invested in projects throughout Greece.

Friends. To close the discussion about our political opponents and go to the answer to the question "why PASOK"? Why PASOK with an eye on the future. Press the Greek people 14, 19. He overstated. The familiar cushion is the taxes of the middle class of the self-employed. Flattening every development effort down to the wine. The gentlemen of SYRIZA put a tax on wine at a time when the outward-looking nature of wine gave opportunities for growth, competition and exports. And of course populism and mockery.

Here, then, is a simple dilemma. Do you want politics with ethics? Do you want politics with consistency and dignity? That speaks the language of truth. Justice everywhere tells me and believes it. And no justice for everyone else except the party cronies of the Prime Minister of the day. He wants meritocracy. Who wants these guys to believe in politics again or look at us the same for all the years to come with half an eye, believing that all politicians are protagonists of buffoonery and offer nothing but big talk. So I am here to put up a fight. To make young people believe again that politics can provide solutions, that they can participate with their opinions with dignity, touching their dreams and hopes for the future, to stay here in Greece, to have families with dignified jobs, to study in our universities. Not to finish university and search the Internet. To find out in which city in Europe they will build their future? What is the future of the country that is turning its children away? No future? We will be an ageing Greece of a much smaller population of 10 million. So that is what we are in debt for. To build a justice, a country with justice and perspective. And above all for the young generation. Because I believe that if the young generation does not stand on its feet, the young generation will never stand on its feet, our country will never stand on its feet. So let's leave big talk in the past. Let us be realistic, because I ask you to trust me.

I can't imagine. I can't imagine. A close associate of mine. My closest associate. And he's a graduate of the Democritus University of Thrace. To be the protagonist in a wiretapping ring. And then to cover him up because he knows they knew?

I can't imagine my closest partner. Nash is giving you the TV licence tender. So I can hand out the channels to certain oligarchs who support me.

I can't imagine being convicted 13-0 by the Special Court. And saying justice everywhere and then instead of sending him home I have him on my ballot. I can't imagine. The cover-up. The denigration. And the disrespect for justice and institutions. And I say that personally. This is the historical legacy of the Andreas Papandreou movement. That he took a Greece of the few, which despised the many, where there was no justice, where there was no respect for the individual, where there was discrimination based on religion and political identity, and made it the Greece of all Greeks. This is the great dowry of PASOK. This is the great dowry of the democratic party.

So let us now look to the future. Why PASOK? Beyond our history and the struggles of yesterday in the proud struggles. And I am really touched to see here the generations of 114 and the founding of 1974, the generations that in the difficult years stayed with the party and kept it alive so that we can take it in our hands and make it great again. To the next. In the next election, friends. In the next election. We have commitments. The specific commitments. Commitments that make people's lives better. That turn the page. So that's why I'm talking about programmatic convergences. It is not a novelty, in most countries in Europe there are coalition governments. But it is not an exchange of ministries. It is not a power-sharing in the background anymore with programmatic agreements. Indeed Tsipras. Now he likes that concept. Why does he see that he has no chance? And he says that the very good German social democrats are the same ones he thought were despicable a few months ago because they were in coalition with the CDU. So we are talking about programmatic agreements and convergence at the forefront.  The first priority is the cost of living. So that is why we believe that we have to build a new welfare state. The greatest cost of living in our time is health care, education. Rent, daily inelastic costs.

In health you know very well here in Komotini, especially in Komotini, because of the situation in the hospital. Health. It is for the Greeks the third largest expenditure in the European Union. We are surpassed only by the Lithuanians and the Bulgarians. Why? Because quite simply. The great child of George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos is the National Health System. Some have left it to its mercy. And if there hadn't been a pandemic, I'd say they didn't know. But after the pandemic. The problem is tragically, it showed the lack of primary care. So we are committed to the regeneration of the NHS. We did it ourselves, we have a duty to regenerate it, First. Strong pay incentives for our health workers when thousands of health doctors are going abroad and their salaries are below the European average. Second. Permanent staff. Permanent staff to staff all hospitals and even incentives for specific specialties whose shortage leads to transfers of hundreds of surgeries across Greece. A new national health system means respect for the worker. That is why I pledge today that, just as we tabled an amendment a few months ago, which the new democracy did not vote for, to include health workers in the heavy and unhealthy category, we will also table an amendment as the next government to stop the mockery of our health workers and finally include them in the heavy and unhealthy category. And this is a clear commitment here in Komotini as well. Friends and friends. Strong primary care means going home. It means that the retired elderly person can have services, as in other European countries. You will tell me. But is there any money for all these things you are talking about? If there was no Recovery Fund, I would have to come up with a fiscal plan. But when the Portuguese, the Italians are using 8 to 10% of the Recovery Fund for their own public health systems, because in Greece we give 4, 2 of which actually go to services, the other 2% for the energy upgrade of buildings, which is essentially for the green transition, so Mitsotakis 2 %.

Friends. Cost of living. Education. That is a big issue and it's not just universities that many people are talking about it's also primary education that has collapsed in our country. So that's why we have to mainly give a foundation in primary education. I think that the best system we have to follow is a uniform system, which will give a national baccalaureate. So that the national exams are abolished. Every child should choose at their school and take exams there so that it is an informed choice, study and not a choice based on their family's financial ability. The older ones know. The great power of public education in the 80s. That gave the public university the opportunity for the child of the farmer's child of the cattle farmer in Komotini to study to be a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, to stay at home and raise a family. Today, the cost of living, the cost of studies, the cost of tutorials makes children choose on their computerised form not on the basis of their real ambition sometimes, but on the basis of the financial capacity of the family. The PASOK, this huge social injustice against the younger generation is not tolerated and will stand in the way by completely changing the way of school selection. And of course, remedial teaching in our schools. To reduce inequalities and reduce tutoring. And strengthening special education structures to truly create an inclusive school.

Friends. You know very well that a big part of the cost of living for students in many parts of Greece is rent, why is it rent? That nowadays, because of the rampant use of short-term rentals, without criteria, without conditions, without framework in urban centres, as is the case in other major European capitals or cities. And without having social housing programmes, you have left the poorest Greeks at the mercy of the rapidly rising cost of living in relation to housing. So that's why, by imitating models of other countries with socialist governments, democratic governments. I say we need to build a social housing program, a pool of 150,000 homes that are either newly built through the Recovery Fund. I want you to understand the evidence and Mr Mitsotakis' disdain for this problem. In newly built homes from the Recovery Fund. The Portuguese did 20,000. The Spanish did 11,000. The new democracy included 70 houses in Athens and 30 in Thessaloniki. This is contempt for the real problems of the people. So we say. Either newer in the Recovery Fund, or with tax incentives or incentives to build. Open up the closed houses in all the major cities of the country, join the social housing, the tank at low rent, so that 150,000 families and students can have cheap and decent housing in the coming years. These schemes are happening all over Europe. I see no reason why they should not also happen in Greece so that there is decent housing that will lead to a drop in overall rents in the country. And not to new ownership, as Mr Mitsotakis suggests.

Friends. Here in Komotini I cannot fail to mention the new price contract we want to sign. With the Greek and the Greek farmer. You know very well that the agricultural sector, the only one that has supported it over time, is our party. But in the right way and not with the mistakes of the past. So that is why we have the priority of reducing production costs. Especially for agricultural inputs, animal feed, fuel by zeroing the excise duty on agricultural oil for the entire duration of the energy crisis. And of course with permanent policies on production costs, it is unthinkable here in Thrace, with the very large areas that exist, that there is not a strong policy of green, fair, energy transition, that is, that hundreds of farmers, livestock farmers, processors, cooperatives can make municipalities energy communities. I know all too well the energy reservoir that this place has. And so through renewable energy sources they can have a fixed production cost, that is, they can consume the energy they produce themselves and the surplus can be sold back to the grid and thus benefit their investment and the local community.

Why is this not happening? Because quite simply the New Democracy's answer is that the grid is not highly interconnected, so what will Greece do instead of making a fair green transition? Is it going to do green transition for the 5 oligarchs of the country? No, Mr Mitsotakis. And this unfair policy at the expense of the Greek people that for the next 15 years some people will speculate with billions on their backs. This party will stand in the way of the next government. If our people are strong, we will make the model of a just democratic transition that all developed European countries are following.

Finally for farmers, universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation. We have a duty to stand in the way of the de-fellatinization of the Greek economy. Establishment of unconfiscated and tax-free subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers. Updating the ELGA insurance regulation to extend coverage of disasters to livestock and plant capital caused by climate change. But for the ministry I guess for the ministry the word "climate change" is a foreign word because you know very well that, there is no coverage for such disasters most of the time. And of course, as far as the programmes of the new common agricultural policy are concerned, they must be completed within a year, without the bureaucracy that exists today, which creates enormous inconvenience for farmers and livestock farmers and, of course, with specific dates for the submission of applications, evaluation and payment.

Friends. Thrace has enormous potential. We have a duty to address not only the social inequalities in Greece that have escalated during the years of the economic and energy crisis, but also regional inequalities. Conditions have changed. There is Egnatia and its vertical axes. The new energy transmission networks to Europe are moving forward. Opportunities are being created to invest in extroversion, to turn our region into a centre and gateway to the Balkan and European hinterland, while at the same time reconstructing the economic life of the region and restoring social cohesion within the region. But this requires a long-term strategy, a plan and a national objective, regardless of the individuals and governments that everyone will consistently serve. Therefore, this issue is both national and developmental; the citizens of Thrace must stop feeling that they are living in a state of alienation from the administrative centre and that they have access to strong health and education services. Our plan includes generous tax incentives, financial, transport and wage content to increase the competitiveness of businesses in the region.

But of course we also need to reach out to new investments, especially in the agri-food sector, so that many good jobs can be created. For us it is a priority to link tourism with agri-food. So that when 20 million tourists come to Greece, it is not only the hoteliers on the islands and in the specific regions who celebrate, but the whole Greek economy. And how are we going to achieve this? If, with measurable goals, we achieve a large percentage of these 20.25 million people taste Greek products, processed Greek agricultural products for as long as they are in Greece, so that they look for them on the shelves in Europe during the remaining months of the year, so that from tourism we are not just a huge hotel as a country, but a real economy that benefits all the Greek people, both in Rhodes and Crete and in Central Greece and in Thessaly and Thrace.

Friends and friends rail reconnection of the region with the rest of Greece. you can't talk about transport costs and the cheapest. I won't say safe with the tragedy of Tempe, but it is the safest as long as the state works properly. So that he wouldn't have other priorities, the buffoonery, the speculation. The train, the most environmentally sustainable means of transport, should not exist throughout Greece, especially in areas with strong development potential.

Friends. Finally, we also have a duty to invest in the natural resources of water. You farmers know very well that the next few years will be difficult and it is very likely that, just as we have been talking about energy this year, we will be talking about water in a few years' time. What we have to do not to make the same mistake that we made with energy and I want to be precise. Some people from Syriza and New Democracy cannot say. What should we do? The war in Ukraine happened. There was Putin's illegal and brutal invasion and that brought the energy crisis. That is not so and do you know why it is not so? Why this war? It has an influence in other countries in Europe and in Portugal. But why did the Portuguese get exemptions that Greece did not get? It is because they are energy blocked because of the Pyrenees. But we are also energy-locked because of the Balkans. What is it that made them better managed? It is because about 60 per cent of electricity generation in Portugal is renewable energy.

Us. What have 2 successive governments of 2 prime ministers absolutely responsible for the current situation done. Instead of going from the fuel, the national fuel, but energy-consuming for the environment and environmentally appropriate, lignite, to renewable energy sources. And to make minimal use of natural gas as a transitional fuel. We committed to one of the highest rates of electricity generation in a country that had no such commitments. Our generation from natural gas, which is not our own but an imported fuel. So we are saying that we have to limit this relationship that creates subservience, that creates weakness that makes us vulnerable to international turbulence. So that is why we are talking about renewables, but be careful. You cannot do all this without a strategic planning. Which is again about the country's production. Again, the production of the country and its manufacturing, so priorities have to be set. The priority is Thrace. Thrace cannot be dependent on pipelines, which tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in an international upheaval could create huge geopolitical issues in the country. That is why we must prioritise the interconnection of Thrace with a strong network to be at the forefront of the green transition. And of course for natural resources concerning irrigation projects, construction of irrigation projects in Rhodope and Xanthi with support for livestock farming and creation of the pilot livestock park which is among our priorities.

Turning to the politics of your region to go to the national? We have a duty to link the university to the local economy. I've been hearing it now for decades and some students even older than me even longer. What does that mean? It means real research. To link a university, the local economy must be in the university. Research programs must serve the strategic plans for regional development of the region. And not to be independent and hovering of the development priorities of the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

In conclusion, I want to tell you that our party. As you know, building on a relationship of trust with citizens on major national issues. These are issues that do not concern a generation. But they concern many generations. And no mistakes, no populisms, no toxicities are allowed. We did not gamble either in our relations with Turkey or in our relations with the Balkan countries. We have tried, with respect for international law, to find scope for dialogue when there was a credible interlocutor. This party was the architect of Helsinki, of the policy that said that there was a European perspective for Turkey, but at the same time it included Cyprus in the European Union. It was the policy for there to be good neighbourly conditions. It is not us who undermined this policy. Because we are the ones who stopped this policy. It was Mr Karamanlis. Whoever chose to hobnob with Mr Erdogan and not a policy that creates the basis for a discussion of a dialogue of de-escalation and decision-making with an eye to the future. So I would like to say here from Thrace that we hope that in the upcoming Turkish elections logic, consensus and moderation will prevail. Because we want the country, the Turkish country, Turkey, to be a stable country, a country without turbulence, with respect for human rights and within Turkey. And anyone who disagrees with the central administration to be afraid to want to leave the country, to close down newspapers. We want a stable neighbouring country, but this requires respect for human rights and international law. So here in Thrace I believe that the European Union has only one choice. The day after the Turkish elections. To talk about a new Euro-Turkish relationship? One that is based on the upgrading of the customs union, but at the same time there will be the whip of sanctions so that there is respect for both the neighbouring countries and the Turkish people themselves, because we cannot tolerate an accession country and their people living without respect for human rights.  

This is Europe. Europe is not just a currency, it is respect for the value of democracy. The institutions of transparency and above all human rights. So that is why, if these violations continue, Europe must stop arming the neighbouring country. I say this because this is a pragmatic policy that offers solutions without words that have no content, but only by looking at the ballot box at the next elections. If PASOK, with all its leaders, has succeeded in having a credible stance on these major issues, the national issues, it is because it has never had its eyes on the ballot box, but its eyes on the future of our people's homeland, the geopolitical security of the country and the vision of Europe, solidarity and perspective.

Friends and friends, all this is not just talk. They are our priorities, they are our projects, they are our values, our positions and our ideas. So this flag. Of ideas, positions and values. I invite you to raise it together on May 21 this struggle. This struggle is not a party struggle. It is a struggle that concerns the candidates. The county committees. It is a patriotic national social struggle. And that's exactly why; we have a huge debt. On the 21st, every democratically progressive Greek citizen should feel that PASOK's home is open again to embrace the struggles of the Greek people, to defend the public interest. To defend the interests of the homeland. So that is why I want you to fight a struggle for dignity. A strong, daily fight. I do not expect anything from the domestic oligarchy, because quite simply what we say does not serve their interests. but I expect a lot from those who what we say changes their lives, and that is all of you. so take in your hands the struggle of the democratic party have a few days left in every village, in every city, in every university, in every workplace. Let us speak the word of progress, of change, of dignity and of hope, the word of the strong democratic party founded by Andreas Papandreou, the democratic party of hope and perspective. Raise high the flag of social justice and national dignity. Victory is ours. The victory is great. May 21, the country turns the page be well and good luck to us. Thank you very much.
