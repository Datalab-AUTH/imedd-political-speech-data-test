So why didn't Mr Mitsotakis use the strategic tool of the Recovery Fund to get a highly interconnected network so that we can move into this new era? Why does he reveal it? Mr. Skra's political choice and the 15th of August. In the summer heat and not wanting anyone to notice what happened while space was left in the network? By legislative regulation they hand it over to the oligarchs at the expense of the Greek people. I say this because energy democracy is a socialist priority and some will tell us. What is energy and democracy and I say to them that it was green growth there, when they were laughing at us and talking about green horses and today they are trying to make these policies a priority. So it is our duty to show the way of the future by looking ahead and not just trying to make sterile debates with a small party objective.
