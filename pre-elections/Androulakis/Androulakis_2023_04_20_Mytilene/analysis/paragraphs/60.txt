Every inch of our homeland and every inch of Cyprus is European territory that solidarity will make all European countries face. The army is not a distant vision, it is the only reality that proves that Europe can stand on its own two feet, especially after the experience of the war in Ukraine. The Greek people cannot pay billions of euros in arms to guard European borders alone, they have a debt and the powerful of Europe have to contribute that this money is money from our health, our education, our welfare state and our infrastructure. That is why the message here from Mytilene from Lesvos is that solidarity is a one-way street for the future of the peoples of Europe, only with solidarity will we remain united with a common future with a common perspective if we continue to. A little bit together and at most apart as the POWERFUL A conservative centres of Europe want. Unfortunately, international developments, challenges will find us weak, as happened in the war in Ukraine. Friends, in closing I would like to thank you and ask you.
