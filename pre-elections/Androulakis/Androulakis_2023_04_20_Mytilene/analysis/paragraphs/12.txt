Why didn't he allow the commissions of inquiry to invite his nephew and the businessmen who marketed the Protato? Because quite simply, Mr Mitsotakis has no interest in the truth, his priority is the cover-up.He knows very well that he is part of this choice to set up a morbid parastate in 2022 in a European country and you can be sure that this will haunt him until the end of his political career, which I hope for the sake of the Greek people will be as soon as possible. That they are not worthy. Greece does not deserve to have a prime minister who does everything he can to save his chair at the expense of the public interest. Because I can't characterize otherwise all that has happened in recent years, and it's not just the interceptions. That happened to many civilians, even to the heads of the armed forces. If it is possible to the heads of the armed forces in a civilian leader but these were certainly happening in other decades and not in a normal European country in 2023, but is that all?
