So what we propose and we have a clear thesis. Obviously for us the sea has borders, obviously a European state, any state has a duty to protect all its borders. And of course we have taken initiatives so that the cost of border protection is not only the financial burden of the Greek people, but through the gallery it is also at the European level, because our borders are also European. It's not just Greek.
