And to commit to the gas that we do not produce. As a result, we are vulnerable to a war in Russia or a crisis within Turkey and Azerbaijan. This is what we want a country vulnerable to international turbulence, a country held hostage, not of course, unfortunately 2 successive governments have managed to make Greece a highly dependent country in the production of electricity from natural gas. What is the goal of our patriotic project? Greece to consume the energy it produces and this will only happen if renewable energy becomes a possibility. For hundreds of thousands of Greek citizens, either through energy communities, farmers, breeders, processors in a municipality, or through photovoltaics on the roofs, so that every Greek citizen knows that our priority is not the energy transition or green transition to become a business of 5 big oligarchs in the country, but a tool of energy democracy. As is the case in all advanced European countries.
