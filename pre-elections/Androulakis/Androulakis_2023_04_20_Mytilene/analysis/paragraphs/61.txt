These 30 days or so that are left before this great historic battle that PASOK will be called upon to fight. To fight by taking the democratic party in your hands, its values, its principles and its history, only you, only you, the ordinary members of PASOK who believed in its contribution in the most important period, the most important era, the era of post-revolution, can bring together with all of us a great and powerful result that will lead Mr Mitsotakis. And Mr Tsipras to be a thing of the past in the face of the modern future of the Greek people. The future of social justice and national dignity. Each and every one of you spent 30 days in every workplace, in every village, in every city.
