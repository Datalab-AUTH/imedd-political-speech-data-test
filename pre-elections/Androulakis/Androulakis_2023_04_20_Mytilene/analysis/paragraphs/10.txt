Perhaps Mr Tsipras had an advantage in 2015 because the Greek people had not experienced a government of Syriza and the far right. Of course, I want to say what is common in the history of our country in the years of post-independence. It is this SYRIZA coalition then ruling with the right not to forget modern history as well. Nobody expected a tax policy that flattens the middle class and the weakest to be the first left-wing tax policy. What is the coveted cushion that Mr Tsipras often invokes?
