Victory is close and from here on Lesvos. The message of victory is strong. On May 21, Greece turns the page, Greece turns the page back to social justice. And unjust dignity or ancient or ancient dignity or value and the future of the Greek people is in your hands fight, fight, fight to be well. Friends and comrades. I present to you the victory ballot paper. The PASOK Change Movement in the Prefecture of Lesvos.
