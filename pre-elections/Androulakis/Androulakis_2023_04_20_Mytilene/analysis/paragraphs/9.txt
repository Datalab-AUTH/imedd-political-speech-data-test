What does Greece have to do with Hungary and Poland? What is Mr Mitsotakis afraid of? So here, all this proves that in the next national elections, all of us who stayed through the difficult times and believed in the movement of Andreas Papandreou, have a huge national debt to stand up to the institutional decline, the institutional decline that Mr Tsipras, Mr Mitsotakis, has led Greece into. To put a stop to social inequalities, to put a stop to the politics that wants the few strong and the many even weaker. Friends, we must and we have a duty to talk about the future. Because the past is now well known to everyone. One can no longer say that he did not know.
