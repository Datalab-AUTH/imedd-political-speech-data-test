Unfortunately we see it in the culture of governance and in this tragedy. The Greek people are asking for only one thing, justice, but justice everywhere and for everyone and not justice for all of us and not for the cronies of Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipras. This is true justice, the justice that every citizen stands equal before it, no matter how powerful his or her friends are, rather than having some people cover for them in the face of such tragedies. Friends and friends, their panic.
