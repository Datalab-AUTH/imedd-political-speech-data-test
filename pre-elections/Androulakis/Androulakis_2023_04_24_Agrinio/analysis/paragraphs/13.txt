We have other priorities, PASOK's priority is the public interest. It is social justice, it is national dignity and not the chair and the personal agonies of Mr Tsipras. So, on 21 May we say to the citizens. Give us the power for us. The priority is that the country can have a political system with ethics, with consistency of words and actions before and after the elections for this. What we are saying is concrete. We are fighting the fight of the concrete and the progressive because young people are tired, young people are tired, Greeks are tired of big words, without impact constantly disappointments. So let us see what our priorities will be with a strong PASOK on 22 May, the day after the elections.
