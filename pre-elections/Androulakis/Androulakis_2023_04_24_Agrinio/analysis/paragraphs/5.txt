In the face of the actions of New Democracy, Mr Mitsotakis, out of his great anguish, even recruited Karatzaferis to pick up some votes and the scarecrow of Mr Tsipras, saying, watch out, SYRIZA is coming, vote for New Democracy and we answer from Agrinio, vote for PASOK so that both of them can leave. They are squeezing PASOK please with the party of drachma of Yanis Varoufakis. No matter how much they want to distort the modern history of Greece. The reality that we are living the democratic party, PASOK was the only party, which from the beginning of the crisis and the bankruptcy left behind by Mr. Karamanlis, kept an honest attitude, a firm position and defended Greece of the euro, when New Democracy, together with SYRIZA, Varoufakis and the extreme right were saying big and easy words with a law and an article. So without asterisks, without illusions from Zappia and Thessaloniki for us, then that struggle was not just about a currency, it was about the geopolitical position of the country, because this geopolitical position of the country is above all security and perspective. Because we are a deeply patriotic movement that does not play games on the backs of the Greek people on such crucial issues of the future.  Mr Mitsotakis accuses us of talking about monstrosities, inventing science fiction scenarios. PASOK, Mr Mitsotakis, knows a monstrosity. That of the lower square and the upper square of drachmas, neo-Nazis, left-wing and blue illusions glorified together on the sacrifices and sufferings of the Greek people.
