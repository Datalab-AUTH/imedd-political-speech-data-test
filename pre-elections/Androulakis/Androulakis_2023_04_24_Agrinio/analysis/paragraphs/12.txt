So he has to choose from a state that takes decisions by giving the loans and the property of the Greek people to foreign funds to a state that ensures the fair regulation of the private debt of households and businesses to a state that ensures the fair regulation of the private debt of households and businesses to a state that subsidizes excess profits to electricity producers and oligopolies and a state that sets rules in the markets and is not captured by small or big interests. Mr Mitsotakis is trying to put on the suit of stability. When he is the main agent of instability with the interceptions, the takeover of the state by the blue children, stating clearly that he will drag the country into as many confrontations as necessary, as long as he is Prime Minister. We respond by saying stability and progress from the first Sunday, without the country getting into the adventures that Tsipras and Mitsotakis want to take it on. On the other hand, Mr Tsipras is saying something terrible. He says I am doing he says the government of winners only. What does a government of winners only mean? It means that he does not believe in the simple proportional representation that he himself voted for. So Mr Tsipras' priority, and let all democrats, progressive Greeks understand this, is not to get rid of the right and Mitsotakis, but to become prime minister himself at any cost to the country.
