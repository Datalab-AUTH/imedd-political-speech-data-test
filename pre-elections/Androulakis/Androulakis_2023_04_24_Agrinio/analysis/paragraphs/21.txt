Support? Supporting energy communities among farmers for renewable energy production. I say this. Because everyone was talking. We were the first to talk about the green transition. If you remember, then New Democracy mainly, but also the coalition. Some of the coalition then were talking about Papandreou's green horses, and now we are looking to see how to make a fair green transition, so that we have stable energy costs and not our country is moving away from lignite and instead our municipalities, our farmers, our cooperatives, our livestock farmers are producing their own renewable energy from sun from wind. Have it all right and hold the country hostage to natural gas, resulting in too many bills going up and too many bills going down, not with policy choices to develop renewables, but with your taxes. They were taking it out of one pocket and putting it in the other pocket. That was Mr Mitsotakis' policy that gave more profitability to the power generators at the time of the energy crisis. Despite the past years, we will stand in the way of this speculation. For us, the green transition will be people-centred. With energy democracy with respect for the environment and production. We also propose universal protection of agricultural land from confiscation, the introduction of the unconstrained and tax-free status of subsidies, compensation and aid to farmers, updating the ELGA insurance regulation with an extension of coverage of disasters to livestock caused by climate change. They probably do not know the word in the Ministry of Rural Development Climate Change, with the result that thousands of farmers are not being compensated by these phenomena.
