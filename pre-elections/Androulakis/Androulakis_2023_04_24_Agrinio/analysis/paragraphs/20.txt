Friends, I cannot fail to mention. Here from Agrinio. From Aitoloakarnania. To the great issue of our farmers. This party once said and did a lot for the farmers, and in one of our commercials, if you remember, we said that blood is not water. So blood is not water because we have proposals to really support our farmers and to keep young people here to produce wealth and to build on their family's assets. That is why, as I did yesterday from Trikala, I am talking about a new contract of honour with the Greek farmer and the Greek farmer. PASOK wants redemptive solutions in the face of the sharp rise in production costs and the precariousness faced by the farming world. We therefore require immediate measures to support our producers, to reduce production costs, especially for agricultural supplies and fuel, with zero excise duty on agricultural oil for the entire period of the crisis.
