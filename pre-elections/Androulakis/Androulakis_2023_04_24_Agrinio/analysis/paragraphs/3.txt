Today. No one from New Democracy said an apology when a month ago we were saying that the transfer of the stationmaster leading to the tragedy in Tempe was illegal and we were told. That it was perfectly legal under the law of the New Republic. The commission appointed by Mr Mitsotakis himself, the three-member commission, said that it was an illegal transfer. Still. And in such tragic events. In which we mourned 57 dead. The majority of them young people, when the central government has such a political ethos of not telling a drop of truth. Do you understand what we owe on May 21 to close this cycle of vicious governance of the New Democracy?
