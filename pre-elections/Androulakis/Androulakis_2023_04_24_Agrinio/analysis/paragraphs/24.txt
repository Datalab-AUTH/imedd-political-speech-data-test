If we had had a meaningful discussion on the refugee migration issue. Substantial but without games, our farmers all over Greece would not be crying today because they have no farm workers and their fruit is rotting on the trees. We would respect as a state, European laws and the framework that exists and respect for refugees, and on the other hand we would have a serious immigration policy to deal with the huge issues of the Greek economy, as is the case in livestock farming, tourism and the agricultural sector.
