I say this, friends, because we are here with a very big debt on 21 May. A strong Greece, with a strong democracy, with strong citizens, with hope and prospects for all Greeks. We are the democratic party that fights for the separation of powers, for the rule of law and human rights. Whoever this affects, we do not weigh these values on the basis of the political nuance of the person affected or our petty party interests. That is why there are 28 days left, 28 crucial days. Just over three weeks. I ask nothing more of you who are here today, but only a take the fight into your own hands, in every village, in every town, in every workplace. Make PASOK the force that guarantees them, the hope and the prospect for all Greeks. Raise the green flag, let the sun of PASOK rise, the sun of hope and perspective, the sun of social justice and national dignity. Today, here in Agrinio, we want to send a message of victory to all of Greece, because PASOK is here, united and strong, good strength and a good fight.
