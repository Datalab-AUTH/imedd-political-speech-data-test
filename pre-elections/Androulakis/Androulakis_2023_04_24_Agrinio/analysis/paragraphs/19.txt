It is time, friends, for a bold and major political change in the economy for a durable growth that will last and not be constantly swayed by international developments. That is what we are talking about. For the strengthening of "Made in Greece" products of domestic production of Greek production. We need to strengthen our extroversion and exports. So that's why we have first priority, providing substantial incentives for value chain networking partnerships, so that new acquisitions of companies stop, search, look for new markets and have improved access to financial sources. These investments therefore propose a three-year exemption from capital gains tax for new business formations created by networking and partnerships. In addition, we propose specific lines of financing. From the NSRF for the relocation of small and medium-sized enterprises to organised craft parks. Special funding lines from the Recovery Fund for SME investments in innovation, energy adaptation, digital transformation and creation of product development centres in the regions to provide technical assistance, standardisation planning for the development of new products and their distribution networks for accumulated debts to tax authorities and social security funds we propose real arrangements in 120 instalments for all with a haircut for the punctual ones.
