This public health that George Gennimatas built with Paraskevas Avgerinos and Mr Mitsotakis is dismantling with his legislation. This education that the child of the farmer and the farmer in the 1980s here from Aitoloakarnania was studying to become a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, producing wealth and providing his family with dignity and prospects. This education as a lever for social justice and upward social mobility. We envision it with a strong public character.
