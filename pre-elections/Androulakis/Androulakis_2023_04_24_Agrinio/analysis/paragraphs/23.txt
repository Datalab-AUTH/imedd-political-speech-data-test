Friends. In closing. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your presence here today. I want you to know that the fight I am fighting is to prove to your children in the younger generations that we are not all the same. So for this. These commitments. Are they written in stone, if not why is it some partisan ego? It is because I am convinced that we must unite our people and not allow the right and Syriza to divide them at the slightest thing. Nuclear accident to happen in Ukraine beating wood, will Tsipras and Mitsotakis fight? PASOK's work is done. Then in 2011 it started in Evros with the fence, Tsipras and Mitsotakis quarreled, because they quarreled, SYRIZA tore it down, no, because one of them said the executives of the New Democracy that we are doing it to orient the people, the memoranda and the others said that the European taxpayer was wrong to pay for it. So what does Syriza want? The Greek people should pay for the security of the European borders with billions of arms that the Greek Parliament did not vote in favour of us guarding our borders and the Europeans should not pay for it, since they are European borders.
Why am I saying this? We do not play with populism. We do not play with passions with problems.
