So, dear friends. On 21 May we vote PASOK and PASOK comes out. We are opening a new page for our country, for the young people, for all generations, and that is why we call on the Greek people to make a choice of responsibility, a choice of change and to choose between a state of opacity that exists only as a spoil for the blue children and a state of transparency and respect for institutions and human rights. A state of social injustice that implements policies for the few and powerful and a state of justice with strong public health and education.
