Is it progressive to be convicted 13-0 by the Special Court because of the TV licenses? His closest associate, Mr. Pappas, and instead of being at home, he's front table center on the SYRIZA ballot.
So what credibility? And let Mr Tsipras finally stop pretending to be the representative of progressive governance. All he can achieve is to be the scarecrow for the gentleman. Mitsotakis, if it were not for this option, New Democracy would already be past the wiretapping scandal. Also, let's remember the past, because these are not recent houia. They are old houia when it had the choice not to co-govern with another, but from the first night tightly embraced by Mr Kammenos and the Independent Greeks today. They say that we. We think it was a bad time with Mr Kammenos, while some of the candidates say it was a blessing to be in coalition with Mr Kammenos. It was probably a blessing in disguise, because if you look at the SYRIZA ballot papers of the so-called Left, there are dozens of candidates who are orphans of Mr Kammenos.
