Friends. Every day, every hour in every corner of Greece. Meetings like these prove only one thing. PASOK on 21 May will be a strong party, a party that will be the protagonist of the new era. So here's why. I invite all Greek democrats, progressive citizens. To raise the green flag of the sun high. The flag of social justice and national dignity of the historic movement of our founder Andreas Papandreou, a movement. Which offered much to the Greek people. A democratic movement, a reformist movement. that has succeeded today after many years of crisis. Millions of Greek citizens. Watching series on television and saying, reminiscing about the good years of PASOK, we have a duty to make the good years of social justice, of perspective and hope for all Greeks a reality again. 27 days. They are left from the moment when citizens will go to the polls in the national elections to make a brave decision for change. To change the terms of their lives. To demand more opportunities for the younger generation, to change the state of favouritism, and the cronies in power. The state they led to bankruptcy and unfortunately some remain unrepentant, continuing these vicious practices. So the dilemma of these elections is not about Tsipras or Mitsotakis, is it? The majority of Greek citizens in the future if these 2 former prime ministers are saved? The people are not interested in answering their personal dead ends. They are already giving change to each other, investing in extreme polarization, false dilemmas and fake news.
