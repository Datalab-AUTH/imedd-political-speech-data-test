With a strong PASOK, I guarantee the creation of a pool of 150,000 social housing units, newly built or with funds from the Reconstruction Recovery Fund, with tax relief for their owners, in order to make them available with social criteria and cheap rent to 150,000 families throughout Greece. Decent and cheap access to housing at a time when rents are soaring across Greece. And why are we saying this? Because it will create a pool of competition to bring down overall rents, which are currently the biggest chunk in the cost of living for a poor family. To come together to create a grid that will address the protection of the first home and private debt as a whole for us the second chance of dignity for all Greeks who fought in a transparent way fought but did not succeed. It is a priority. We will not allow the Greek economy to be deflated and the red loans of cooperatives and businesses to become a framework for blackmail in order to put everything in foreign hands. So what is this protection? No first home on the basis. The ability of each family and social criteria, objective, social and economic criteria, will not be auctioned. We are not discussing Mr Tsipras' populists. Who said in 2014 before the election don't pay your loans Seismicity. And then a year later he passed the law that handed over all the probably billions of red loans to the funds, so that today a large part of the Greek people are being extorted. We therefore respond to populism with justice and rationality. That is why we are reinstating the protection of the first home with an updated law, like the PASOK law of 2010. The Katseli law that Mr Tsipras wants to appropriate by putting Katseli close to him but not telling the Greek people that SYRIZA never voted for it was opposed to this 2010 law. As it was opposed to every effort to support society in a very difficult phase of the economic crisis.
