Friends with PASOK strong. On the first Sunday. We are negotiating a strong national health care system of free public health care, which has historically been the priority of the democratic party for all Greeks and especially at this time when spending, private spending on health care is third in the entire European Union for Greeks, after only Bulgaria and Lithuania. And while we have some of the lowest wages. So that's why I pledge that we will use not 2-4% of the Recovery Fund for the NHS, as New Democracy does, but 8-10% of the Recovery Fund. To create a strong network of primary health centres throughout Greece. Do you know very well here in Agrinio what happened to your hospital? So we and I am talking about the pandemic era. We therefore demand immediate staffing of NHS hospitals with permanent medical staff, as well as an increase in the salaries of NHS doctors, bringing them into line with those of doctors. The European Union, the establishment of social, economic and scientific incentives to stop the understaffing of hospitals in the region and, of course, to be fair to all medical professions and especially to those who have given the struggle of the pandemic to finally be included in the heavy and unhealthy health workers of the national health system.
