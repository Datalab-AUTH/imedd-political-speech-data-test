For us. The real qualitative development will be when we don't have a vision of Greece becoming a vast hotel, but when we have a vision of tourism working with agri-food, with manufacturing and that the profits that they have on the islands and in specific parts of Greece are shared by farmers and livestock farmers throughout Greece. This is a real model of European development that benefits all the Greek people. Also, the foreign investment business says for foreign investment. Truly productive foreign investment is only 14% of all investment, with the rest being real estate and exports from existing Greek businesses. So the question for Mr Mitsotakis is inexorable, Who has benefited from these policy choices? Certainly not the Greek households whose disposable income was reduced due to price pressures. It is telling that 30% of Greeks are now threatened with poverty and social exclusion. According to official Eurostat figures, while inequalities have widened dangerously. Therefore, neither small nor medium-sized enterprises have benefited from the favourable low-interest loans from the Recovery Fund, which are essentially administered by the banks and which, according to figures from two months ago, 67 enterprises have received 1.1 billion at an interest rate of 1.2%, when thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises have been excluded. So that is why we believe that the Recovery Fund should be geared with incentives to this huge mass of SMEs.
