So that's why there are lessons of responsibility elsewhere and there is of course the example of Mr George. The man that SYRIZA and New Democracy tried to blame the bankruptcy of Mr. Karamanlis with the 15.5% external deficit. When he was vindicated a few weeks ago by the European Court of Human Rights. Such is the liberalism of Mr Mitsotakis and the Progressivism of Mr Tsipras that they did not issue a word of statement to apologise for trying to blame the bankruptcy of the right wing by the so-called Left and Right on a single man. Is this not European normality?
