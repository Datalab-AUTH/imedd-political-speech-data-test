Friends and friends. Economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. The government presents a false picture of the Greek economy. Again we started with concrete numbers and half truth. In practice the problems and inequalities are escalating. The gross public debt broke the 400 billion euro barrier in the era of Mr Mitsotakis. I certainly do not see all those professors who came out in previous years and spoke publicly about the huge debt issue saying anything before the elections. About where New Democracy has taken the debt. The trade deficit and it has increased. Where are all these people who knew the lot to explain to us how the economy is doing well when the trade deficit is escalating and the debt is past 400 billion. The government is touting the high rates, it says GDP growth. So the growth of the denominator. It's real growth, it's healthy growth. This growth is due first of all to the big fiscal intervention that was made during the pandemic years and it's most of the taxes of the Greek people and of course consumption and partly tourism.
