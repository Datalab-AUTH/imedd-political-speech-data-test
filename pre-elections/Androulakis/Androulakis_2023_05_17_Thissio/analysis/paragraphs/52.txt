We are sending a message here today from Athens: vote for PASOK so that both of them can go home. But I have a deep debt. We have a debt for a new political ethos, for a new political paradigm, for a new model of governance, for new standards of leadership, for new standards of public administration. So think about who are the credible people to serve these new standards? Those who served the Karamanlis government, left and right? Those who did not issue a statement about the vindicated Mr. Georgiou after the European Court of Human Rights decision? Those who co-governed with Kammenos? The ones who created an eavesdropping parastate? Mr. Mitsotakis, his nephew with the NSA? The ones who strike together the independent authorities created by PASOK?
