So, we speak realistically, concretely. 350,000 low pensioners, the new ESAS, which will replace the ESAS abolished by Mr Tsipras. Abolition of the personal differential from 1/01/24. And abolition of the injustices concerning widows' and disabled citizens' pensions. These are 3 options of justice and social solidarity for the weakest pensioners, so that the proud old people of our country can have pensions, dignity. Those who have seen perspective, who have seen justice from this party.
