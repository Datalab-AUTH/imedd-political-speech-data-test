So I want you now, Greek people, to imagine: If my own closest associate had made a bugging parastate and I covered it up, would I be in the political system today? So why does Mr Mitsotakis exist? If my closest associate was handing out channel licences to friendly oligarchs, was being prosecuted by the Greek judiciary and I had him by my side, would I exist today in any normal European political system? What am I talking about? If we want Greece to be a normal European state, these two systems of power must go home, because they undermine any perspective, any justice in Greece. They directly undermine the future of the Greek people.
