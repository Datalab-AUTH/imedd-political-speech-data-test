Friends, we have a duty to confront depravity, unworthiness, arrogance. Almost three months have passed since the unbelievable tragedy in Tempe. Yesterday I was stunned to hear Mr Mitsotakis commenting on the complaint filed by the victims' relatives, saying without a trace of empathy that he understands the anger of the victims, but that he does not justify this kind of behaviour. Will you, Mr Mitsotakis, dictate to a parent who has mourned his child how to express himself? Is that possible? Is it possible? Has the decline of your political morality reached its nadir? Has your contempt for the unfortunate people and their families come to an end? The arrogance and decadence of Mr Mitsotakis' speech is truly shocking for every Greek woman and every Greek. But who is saying this? He who took a whole week to make a clear apology after the tragedy. The Prime Minister and his ministers were telling us that the transfer of the offending stationmaster was legal and the three-member committee he appointed said it was illegal, but they are not saying whose New Democracy MP the offending stationmaster of the tragedy was a buffoon. But these are the words of the President of the party who has Mr. Karamanlis, the youngest, as a candidate on his ballot papers. The minister of the Ministry in question who, in answer to the questions of the PASOK MPs, was ignorant of the findings of the Transparency Authority, which had been in his drawer for two years, and was clearly saying who was responsible, both in the Syriza era and in the New Democracy era, for the fact that there was no telecommunications in the country to protect our 57 fellow citizens, and instead of taking it to the courts, instead of bringing it to justice, he kept it in his drawer and he is on the ballot of the New Democracy.
