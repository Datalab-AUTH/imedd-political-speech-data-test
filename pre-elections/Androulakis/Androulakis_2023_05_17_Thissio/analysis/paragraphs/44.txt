It's coming back, this party is coming back. United, renewed, the great democratic party, where there is no change, where there is no reform without the signature of PASOK, in the best years of the Greek people. So I want to say something about change because some people think they can plagiarise the word. The word you can. You can't take the history because it is engraved in the memory of the Greek people. It is, Mr Tsipras, the images, the experiences of the underprivileged Greeks who have seen their lives improve. Those who experienced the post-civil war state and the PASOK of Andreas Papandreou recognized the national resistance. They are the ones who have engraved in their minds what the hospitals were before '81 and what the National Health System of George Gennimata and Paraskevas Avgerinos was from '80 onwards. They are the ones who crowded the buffet shops and after the late Anastasios Peponi's AESEP they saw what European meritocracy, normality means. They are the ones who saw the great infrastructure projects, the public universities, the CCP, Diavgeia, Kapodistrias in local government. But I ask you, Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis, when did you support even one of these great changes that marked the history of the country, the history of the democratic party? In all of them you were an obstacle. You have been the front line of conservation from both the right and the left.
