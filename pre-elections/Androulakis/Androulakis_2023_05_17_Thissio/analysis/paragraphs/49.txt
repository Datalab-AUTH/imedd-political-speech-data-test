Friends, every day I meet young people, young people frustrated, young people without a shred of trust in politicians. But why? Because they have experienced politicians who say a lot and either do nothing or do little. I invite you to trust us in this new beginning. And I personally pledge that I will not let any young person down. Come together. We do not despise you. We do not deceive you. We give you perspective. We are not giving you the 150 euro passports, Mr Mitsotakis.
