Friends, May 21, every vote you cast is a mound against their authoritarianism and their decadence. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for the Greece of the future. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for a Greece of dignity. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for a Greece of equal opportunities. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for social justice and national dignity. That is why on 21 May I ask every democrat, every progressive Greek to turn their backs and come together to embrace your struggles, to build a normal country for you and your children. Despise them. May 21, a wasted vote is not a vote for PASOK. A lost vote is May 21 to those who for 8.5 years have been doing what they can, not for you, but for them and the chair. A lost vote is not a lost vote to PASOK. It is to those who despise your real problems, who despise your everyday life. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for the brave changes our country needs. Every vote for PASOK is a vote for stability. Every vote for PASOK is hope. Every vote for PASOK is dignity. Therefore, raise proudly the flag of PASOK, the flag of the democratic party. This green flag that gave hope, this green flag that was raised by millions of Greek underprivileged people. Raise it again so that together we can build the Greece of the future, the normal Greece, the European Greece, the Greece that will be a real support for the middle class and for every Greek woman and Greek underprivileged. We have only a few days left. So I ask you as a last favour here from Athens, in this magnificent gathering: take the struggle, the agony, the hope into your own hands. In every village, in every town, together, united, strong, we are reviving the people-born movement of Andreas Papandreou. Our movement, PASOK. All together, fight together. And I am sure, May 21 dawns a new day, a new page in the book of modern political history. PASOK has come back as a protagonist and all of you are proving it with today's "people's rally", with this magnificent gathering. I thank you for your love from the bottom of my heart, and I pledge that we will never disappoint any Greek, any progressive democrat. This is the true home of progress. Here is the true home of democracy. Here is hope, here is perspective. Good strength and good fight. May 21. We will never forget the date of victory. Fight, fight, fight and PASOK will be the winner of the national elections. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this moving presence here in Athens. Bless you. How many Greeks are not moved by this song and this flag! That is why we have a duty to make them say "PASOK, good years" again. 21 May, we are confronting the vested interests and making the love for this movement a hope. We clash with everything that keeps Greece tied back to the past. We clash with discord, with the digital gangs that poison young people online. We clash with everything that serves the system, the authoritarian regime of Mr Mitsotakis. Because here is the real opponent of New Democracy. In SYRIZA he is the "golden" sponsor. So for this, fight, fight, fight. May 21 the rebirth of PASOK will mean the rebirth of the country. Be well. Thank you, be well. I am confident of victory. I am sure that the hopeful message sent by the democratic people of Athens today is vibrating throughout the country and is moving. Today, Democrats embrace. Together we will win. Bless you.
