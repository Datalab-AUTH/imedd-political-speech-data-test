Together we will fight. Together we will change our country. Together on Sunday night we will be the great victors. Fight. A few days, a few hours, a lot of struggle and on Sunday night I am waiting for you for a new Change Party at Charilaou Trikoupis, at the historic offices of PASOK, the democratic party. Friends, they are trying. I never expected in my life to live this moment. And I guarantee you that I will do everything I can to ensure that we are both united and strong, as we once were. I am a scion from the bowels of the party. And together, we who have stayed through the hard times, will revive this democratic movement.  We will be guarantors of better days. We will be guarantors of a Greece of dignity. We will be guarantors for the new generation, to live days of perspective, with good jobs. For the new generation that the country needs to stay here, to have families, to stop the exodus of young people abroad. This will be the task of the democratic party. Ladies and gentlemen, in recent hours, however, some people have been trying to terrorise the Greek people, drawing attention to the danger of ungovernability. You know, after every election there is always a government. The question is, Greek people, will this government serve those who are trying to terrorise you, the media owners and the oligarchs, or will it serve you, your children and your grandchildren? So terrorize the terrorists with a strong PASOK on May 21. Terrorism does not pass. We will have a government. We want a government that serves the people, not them. My friends, the right will fall because the democratic party is returning in force, because there is an alternative, a progressive, democratic alternative.
