But, friends, what is PASOK's vision for the Greek people? It is a vision grafted from the historical and social roots of the democratic party. It is the vision of social justice, of a Greece without inequalities. Of equal opportunities for young people. Of a strong welfare state, of public education, a lever of social upward mobility for all Greek children. Friends, we do not feed rabbits and stones. We want a democracy with strong institutions, with the rule of law that protects the human rights of every citizen.
