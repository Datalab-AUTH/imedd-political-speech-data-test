Who is talking about meritocracy? Who is talking about transparency? The one who, if you put together his and his family's buffers, exceeds the length of the Great Wall of China? Who is the Mitsotakis family giving lessons to? But what is there to remember? The buffets? The defections? Or the eavesdropping parastate that imitated his father and Mr. Mavrikis? He is giving me lessons in meritocracy and transparency, he who is a champion with 10 billion direct awards. Who is a champion of temporary employees. He who spends the taxes of the Greek people, with the sole aim of being supported by the oligarchs, with the sole aim of continuing the client state, with the sole aim of the chair of Maximos. His recent statements that he "cannot talk to PASOK" of my era confirm one thing once again: In the stakeouts, I was obviously not a danger to the Republic or to the country; I was a danger - like this grassroots movement - to New Democracy.
