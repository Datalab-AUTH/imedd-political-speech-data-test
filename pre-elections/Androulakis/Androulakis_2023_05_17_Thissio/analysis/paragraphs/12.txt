So I would add to what you said, that Mr Mitsotakis, if Varoufakis did not exist, he would have had to invent him, as is the case with you, Mr Tsipras, the golden sponsor of New Democracy. Of course, I have not understood what the government proposal of SYRIZA is. On the one hand it says coalition with Varoufakis.  On the other it says coalition without Varoufakis. The third says coalition with a vote of tolerance. And yesterday it says special-purpose coalition. I understand your anxiety, Mr Tsipras. But the democratic party will not be a lifeline to your adventurism.
