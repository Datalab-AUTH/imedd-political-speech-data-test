Mr Mitsotakis appears as the only choice for power. Confined to his glass tower, he lives with his Maximos cohorts in a parallel universe revolving around power and themselves. He believes that he is the stability. That he is democracy. That he is the State. May 21 marks the end of Mr Mitsotakis's Ludovite notions. Now Mr Mitsotakis is playing the role of a moderniser, bragging that this will enable him to win over a section of democratic citizens. However, PASOK voters are neither sheep nor lion-eaters. They do not forget, Mr Mitsotakis, that your party in 2009 handed us a bankrupt Greece, and instead of apologising to the people and supporting the agreement that kept our country in the euro, you and Tsipras voted for the path of the drachma. This is not modernisation. That is a compromise with populism. If it had not been for the PASOK MPs, Mr Tsipras and Mr Mitsotakis, if they had not existed then, they would have become prime ministers, they would have been prime ministers in a drachma country. This was their understanding of the economy and the huge social deadlocks that Mr Karamanlis handed us in 2009. The people have a memory. The people do not forget. The people do not forget the family tradition of Mr Mitsotakis, who also teaches me lessons in political realism in the management of the state.
