And of course, we have a patriotic debt, we have a great patriotic debt: to stand in the way of the de-Fellinization of the Greek economy. We must prevent the Greeks from becoming foreigners in their own country. Greeks will not be blackmailed by powerful economic centres abroad. That is why we are legislating to have a law that puts funds at the table of bank negotiations with borrowers, not blackmail that leads to the sudden death of thousands of our fellow citizens. We have a duty to protect the Greeks that Mr Tsipras has sent to the margins and despair by selling billions of red loans to the crows of the funds.
