I want you to think about who is against us. Against us are those who have even come to instrumentalize the neo-Nazism of Golden Dawn.  The so-called left-wingers are not voting to prevent our democracy from preventing the murderers of Fyssa from taking part in the elections. And Mr Mitsotakis is counting the neo-Nazi party in the polls to see what he will do.
