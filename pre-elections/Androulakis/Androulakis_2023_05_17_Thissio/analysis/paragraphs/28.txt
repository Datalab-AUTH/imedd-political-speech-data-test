The mother, the family, the young mother - who in the difficulties of the present time - knows all too well that by having a family, she prevents the continuation of her economic function, her position, her daily life. We are committed: No child will be left out of daycare, no child will be left out of creative activity centres. Increase the allowance for women freelancers. And of course, a reduction in taxes on families with children. Today, a family without children and a family with children - with children - has 3 tax rate points less. In Portugal the difference is 10%, in Ireland 14% and in Belgium 15%. That is why I am committed to strong tax incentives for young couples with children, to give a real boost to tackling the demographic issue.
