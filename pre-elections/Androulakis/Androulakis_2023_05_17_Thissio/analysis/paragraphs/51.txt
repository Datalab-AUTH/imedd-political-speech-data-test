Friends, some people say that we didn't want to cooperate and I was looking for some scenarios to turn the corner. Do you think they want to work with us? Does Mr Mitsotakis want to cooperate with us or Mr Tsipras? They do not want to work with PASOK. They want to plunder PASOK. That is what they have been doing for 15 years now. But this illegitimate, this illegitimate bipartisanship will fail miserably in these behind-the-scenes games. You know, they're getting comfortable with each other. One says, "Don't vote for PASOK, it will go with Syriza." The other one says "don't vote for PASOK, it will go with New Democracy".
