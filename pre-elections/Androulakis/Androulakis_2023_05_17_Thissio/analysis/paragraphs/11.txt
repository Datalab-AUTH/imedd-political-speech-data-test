Are you the same Mr Tsipras that your problem with the Evros fence that PASOK started is not to remove the fence but to prevent European taxpayers from paying for it? Only the Greeks want Syriza to pay for it. Or are you who say that the sea has no borders and let's do the Aegean Prespes not after all a bigger sponsor of Mitsotakis than Varoufakis?
