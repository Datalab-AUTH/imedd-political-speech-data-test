Friends, we are facing Kyriakos Mitsotakis who is hiding what is coming as a result of his political choices. And on the other side, Mr Tsipras, who promises things that once again he knows cannot be done. Back then he called them illusions. Now he knows he won't be in government and can say whatever he wants.
