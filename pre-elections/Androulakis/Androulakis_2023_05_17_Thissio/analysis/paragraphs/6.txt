The stronger PASOK, the more the power of Mr Mitsotakis creaks. However, all of you 270,000 democratic citizens have given me a mandate for an autonomous course. And the autonomous march does not enter into power bargains. We are talking about stable governments, about programmatic convergence. No bargaining with oligarchs, no bargaining with ministries. Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipras should go elsewhere if they think that this historic movement will become a crutch for their power. With your thunderous presence today, you are proving that PASOK is strong, that it is a protagonist. And on 21 May you are sending a message of victory to every democrat, to every progressive Greek. This movement, this historic movement has only one concern: to serve the people and the homeland in a genuine way. That is why we are united. More united than ever!
