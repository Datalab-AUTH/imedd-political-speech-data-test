Friends, 3 days before the national elections, I cannot talk about the huge issue of public health. We gave birth to the National Health System, we will rebirth the National Health System. But what do they understand? What do they understand about the anguish of the pensioner, the weak person who sees the cost of health care spending has skyrocketed? We are third, third in private health care costs in Europe. We are surpassed only by the Lithuanians and the Bulgarians. So what are we saying? A new national health system. From the Recovery Fund, not the 2-4% that Mr Mitsotakis gives, but 8-10%.
