We are here for a strong PASOK, to become a barrier - a mound against arrogance, against the client state, against everything that undermines the prospects of the Greek people. Greeks, after your 2015-19 experience of the Tsipras-Kammenos coalition government, we understand the fear of the return of populism, divisiveness and viciousness. That is why I ask for a strong mandate, so that you have a strong alternative. The real progressive democratic party is the option to close the cycle of Mitsotakis' government.
