People of Athens, welcome to this celebration of democracy, of hope, of hope, of perspective. A big thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm welcome. A big thank you from the bottom of my heart for your trust. And another big thank you for the message of victory that we are sending tonight from all corners of the country. PASOK is here, united and strong, and we are sending a strong response to our political opponents. PASOK is here to give us a new perspective, a hope to turn the country around. Dignity for social justice. The democratic party, the movement of Andreas Papandreou, is here again, a protagonist in the political scene of our country. Friends, every day they fight us in the front and behind the scenes. Every day we are beaten by SYRIZA and New Democracy. But today Athens is sending a clear message: The more they hit us, the stronger we get. Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Tsipras, this is the party that is identified with the Greek people, this is the people-born movement. It is the movement of 1974 that sealed the post-independence, the best years of the Greek people. It embodied the dreams of many generations and made Greece a normal European country. Friends, PASOK is Here, United, Strong. Because the needs of our country call for new struggles. To daily struggles. The Greek people can no longer tolerate inequalities and unreliability. The Greek people can no longer tolerate the client state, the devaluation of the public interest.
