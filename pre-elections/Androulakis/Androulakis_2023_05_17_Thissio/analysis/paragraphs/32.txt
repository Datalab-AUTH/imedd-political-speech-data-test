Friends, we do not want the development of feminism. We want the development of Made in Greece, of strong domestic production. We want a Greece of exports, not of trade deficits. In order to create good jobs, we want the synergy of the agricultural sector, of manufacturing. All the forces of production to serve a plan that changes the plan of the country and not to become a huge short-term rental in urban centers and a huge hotel where only the owners will profit far from the real aspirations of the new generation for good jobs, eating away at our natural wealth. That is why our vision is to interconnect all these productive sectors and give farmers, manufacturers, poor Greeks, a stable cost of living through the democratization of production, renewable energy sources, as in every European state, and not to make the green transition a tool of speculation of the oligarchs in the country. Those who caress Mr Mitsotakis every day from their channels.
