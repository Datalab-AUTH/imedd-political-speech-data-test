Who will the Greek people trust? Those who have come to say that we are competent former Syriza ministers? The candidates for deputies? Shall we also co-govern with Velopoulos to conquer the chair? Or Mr Mitsotakis, who says "Come Centrists to support me", but who is co-governing with the popular orthodox alarm hand in hand with Karatzaferis and his children.
