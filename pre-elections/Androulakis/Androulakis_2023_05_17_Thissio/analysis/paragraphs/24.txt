I and we all together set the generation as our front line. We say that if the new generation does not stand on its feet, the country will never stand on its feet. Therefore, because young people fear that they will live worse than their parents, we have a duty to give them the weapons to start their lives with dignity. That is why we propose a social reservoir of 150,000 houses in all the major urban centres, especially in Athens and Thessaloniki. So that your children can come and study with dignity. So that young couples can have a family with children. Our first priority is to address the demographic issue.
