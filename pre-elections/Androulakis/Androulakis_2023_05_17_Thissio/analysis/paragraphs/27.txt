In education, in public education, which is our priority. We must equip the younger people. We are establishing a national school-leaving certificate in line with the standards of other European countries, because we do not want the future of young people to be judged by instant examinations, with stress and wasted time. We want to stop the tutorial school from being the centre of gravity of education and make public schools - the Gymnasium, the Lyceum - the centre of gravity of public education again. Reduce the cost of tutoring with remedial teaching. And of course, as a normal European state, we must invest in special education structures for the real school of inclusion, for all the children of the Greek people with any learning difficulty. And of course, the strong public university with an increase in funding for research to the European Union average.
