The Recovery Fund was made for the pandemic. The pandemic undermined the national health care system. We have a duty to support it, to reduce inequalities, to drive down the cost of living. For that, strong primary health care across the country. For that, 15,000 permanent staff recruitment, for that, pay for doctors and all NHS staff at the European Union average. That's why we are committed to and will make it happen. It is a gesture of justice. They fought. They held the NHS together in the difficult days of the pandemic.
