Friends, on 21 May we are forming a new progressive social alliance, a new majority current of progress, hope and responsibility. On 21 May we put an end to the arrogance of Mr Mitsotakis, while turning our backs on the populism of Mr Tsipras, which we have paid dearly for. Next Sunday evening, our political opponents will be surprised on the evening of next Sunday. They will be surprised. Already today they are probably surprised. The celebration of democracy started early, it starts today here in Athens and it will culminate on Sunday evening with the historic resurgence of the democratic movement, of PASOK. PASOK is here united and strong.
