That is why I pledge, I pledge to every Greek woman and every Greek man and woman that a strong PASOK means an end to anarchocracy. All the governors of organisations, the governors of hospitals, with an open international competition to serve you, your children, your grandchildren, the most deserving Greeks, the people who have competence, who manage millions of euros, not for the benefit of the prime minister of the day, not for the benefit of the best friend of the day, but for the benefit of all you citizens who pay millions in taxes and want another Greece, the Greece of European normality. This is the Greece we envision, this is the Greece we will serve.
