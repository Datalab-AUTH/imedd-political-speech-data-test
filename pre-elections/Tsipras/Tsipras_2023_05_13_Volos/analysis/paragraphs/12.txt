Mr Mitsotakis said one more thing today. He said, "We have fully implemented our programme". And I wonder what is this programme that they have implemented in full? These promises that they made during the election? Or the ones they implemented after the election? Do you remember what they said during the election? They said that they would support the middle class, but the middle class has ended up living on food stamps. With coupons at the supermarket. Coupons to pay for electricity. Coupons to go to the gas station.
