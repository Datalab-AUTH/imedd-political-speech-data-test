Because what else do people want today, regardless of whether they voted for Syriza, or ND, even in the past? Regardless of whether they are left-wing, centrist, or even right-wing. What they are asking for is a big change in their lives. Change is what today's young people who work unpaid twelve-hour days want. The shopkeeper who's being hounded by the collection agencies. The retiree who struggles to give his grandchildren an allowance. The working mother who, with two trips to the supermarket to get the necessities for her child, sees her month's paycheck slip away.
