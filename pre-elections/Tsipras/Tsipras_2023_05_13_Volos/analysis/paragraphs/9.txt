This is as far as the vast majority of our people say. This is the end of arrogance, this is the end of indifference, this is the end of obscenity, this is the end of family rule, this is the end of the parastate, this is the end of injustice.
With your vote, the worst right-wing since the post-war era will be gone. It's up to you. It is up to the Greek people next Sunday to finally end not only, not just the right, but a regime. Because the regime that has ruled us for four years is a regime that has a very strong element of family rule. And this regime, I believe, is not tolerated even by the traditional South-West voters. The honest conservative voters.
