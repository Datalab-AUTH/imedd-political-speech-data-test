So we say it's time to bring that change. I heard just before I came to talk to you on the news bulletin Mr Mitsotakis speaking today to some of his few friends in the centre of Kypseli, in Athens. And I heard him say "we have a big current". And I wonder how it is that this big current is only seen by Mr. Mitsotakis' courtiers and Mr. Mitsotakis himself and not seen by people in their daily lives? Where is this great current? Did none of you see it in the squares, in the workplaces, in the villages that you go to here in the Region. Did no one see it where the young people are in the places of entertainment? Where did you see this great stream? The only big, very big current is the PPC bills that come to every house, every household and have the stamp of Mr Mitsotakis.
