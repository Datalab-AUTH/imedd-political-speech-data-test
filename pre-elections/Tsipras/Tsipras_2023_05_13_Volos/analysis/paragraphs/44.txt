That is why, in summing up the dilemma of the ballot box, I want to tell you that, in the end, it is one: Mitsotakis or change? Mitsotakis or justice? Government of impunity or government of cooperation? SYRIZA first and a government of progressive cooperation, or another four years of arrogance, indifference, injustice, obscenity? That is the dilemma. And the majority of our people have already answered this dilemma: SYRIZA on Sunday 21 May. SYRIZA's victory. Victory of our people.
