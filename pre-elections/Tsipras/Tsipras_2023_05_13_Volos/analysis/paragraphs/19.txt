Today, just before I came to Volos, after the rally in Trikala, I had a special meeting with three tragic people. The parents of the three girls who went missing in Tempe and they met me to ask me one thing: Not to forget this tragedy and to find justice for their lost children. For the 57 lives that were lost unjustly.
