Citizens of Volos, thank you for this great gathering, for this warm welcome.  Your presence here today in the port of Volos is a message, a decisive message, the most irrefutable message. Next Sunday it will be the people who will celebrate, not the cartels. The people will be celebrating and it will be a victory for democracy and not for the powerful. And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your presence today, because Volos, Magnesia is giving us another great, another impressive rally, which shows the way to victory next Sunday. Because we have no choice but to win. It is a matter of life. It is a question of dignity. It is a matter of our children's future.
