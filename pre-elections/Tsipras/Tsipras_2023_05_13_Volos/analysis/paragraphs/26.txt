We defend the homeland not with words, but with actions. And we defended it when we had to and when we were in front. We did not say that we are blowing wind and taking the waves of Oruc Reis who is conducting research and violating our sovereign rights.
And we certainly never said we never said we never abrogated our national rights. Because it is a national right, to recall the words of the late Manolis Glezos, who said that even if it is one euro in war reparations and the occupation loan, Greece must claim it.
