But I want to say a few words about the great damage, the great trauma, the great stain not only on the issues of society, but also on the issues of democracy. Because Mr Mitsotakis has been an abuser of democracy and of the articles of the Constitution. With this system of illegal surveillance conducted in his office, and now the European Parliament itself is adopting the resolution of the competent committee, which identifies Mitsotakis himself, the Prime Minister himself, as the orchestrator of this illegal surveillance. Himself. And he comes to the debate the day before yesterday - I'm afraid he won't come to a debate again after this, for 8 years we've been asking him to come, I keep asking him for the two of us to go to a debate. He thought that because there would be five others, he would hide behind them, but he slipped up on the first tough question, and where he had been telling us for 9 months that it's not a scandal, he told us it's a scandal. But he also told us something even more serious. He told us that there was no national reason for this surveillance. And I ask myself: if there was no national reason, then how exactly did he tell us that there was a national secret and not let the truth come out in the House committee and cover up the truth?
