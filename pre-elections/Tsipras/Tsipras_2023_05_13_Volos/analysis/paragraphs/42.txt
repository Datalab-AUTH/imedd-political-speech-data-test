I am saying all this because some people have said that the programme of the New Democracy and Syriza are the same. So I wonder, asking progressive forces, which is more beneficial? To give space to the judiciary to shed light on the interceptions, or to suddenly declare that it's okay that there weren't that many? And that those who uncovered the dozens of interceptions had some mischievous purpose and revealed them. What is more beneficial, to give society a breather or to finally make it easier for Mr Mitsotakis to appear as a solution when he is the problem?
