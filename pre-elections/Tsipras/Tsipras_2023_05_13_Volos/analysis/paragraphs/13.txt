So what is this programme that he has implemented in full? The staff state of the theft of public money? Roussefulness and partisanship? The abuse of the rule of law through wiretapping and cover-up? What does Mr Mitsotakis leave behind him after four years? 50 billion more public debt. 40 billion more private debt and half of Greece, 4,250,000 Greeks in debt. With bad debts to banks, to the tax authorities, to the social security funds.
