In any other country in Europe it could not stand for a day. But here it does. He is standing just fine, and so is the prosecutor of the NSA, who illegally signed the wiretaps. He is standing. I wonder why? Where is he keeping Mr Mitsotakis? But also the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, who, instead of solving this crime, made sure to put obstacles in the way of an honest judge, the head of an independent authority, the AADE, who found the evidence of the crime despite the Prosecutor's efforts to prevent him. And he found the evidence of the crime in the telecommunications providers.
So I wonder what exactly does Mr Mitsotakis want after this confession of his own, by going and asking for the vote of the Greek people? He wishes this vote to be a vote of purification. What exactly is he saying to the voters of the Southwest? He is saying to them, "vote for me to cleanse me".
