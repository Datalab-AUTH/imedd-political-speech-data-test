And finally, I want to remind you that it was the SYRIZA government that made your university, the University of Thessaly, the most successful example of contributing to the development of this region, with millions of euros of current investments in infrastructure, with a contribution to innovation and start-ups. With millions of euros of public investment, of course, in order to have faster growth in research results, in research programmes and substantial results for the country. So this legacy, you know, we will preserve it. And it is the example that we will follow throughout the rest of Greece. Because we have a vision of a public education accessible to all children, regardless of their financial means. Public, strong, reliable, high-quality universities, because we want to invest in the future, we want to invest in knowledge. This is the great asset of young people to face the challenges of tomorrow.
