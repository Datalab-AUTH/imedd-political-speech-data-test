Now I'll feel like the singer who sings a song underneath and I'll say. That's good though. Sharing thoughts, sharing thoughts. So you want me to tell you about German reparations.
Well, yes, these are the nationalists who rule us. The patriots. They are the patriots. So patriotic that when we did our patriotic duty, because that's what we did, to not have a Libya on our northern border that would be led by third countries and have Greek warplanes patrolling its airspace. When we did this task, we were told that it was treason. And what else were we told? That we swapped pensions, because they were tied to the fact that pensions would be cut, for Prespes. And when they became the government, they not only honoured the agreement, they honoured it to the hilt. The day before yesterday, Zaev sent a letter to Mitsotakis to thank him for how much of a friend he is and how much he honoured the agreement. They do not put these things out in public. That is the hypocrisy of the patriotic hypocrites. The hypocrisy of the patriots.
