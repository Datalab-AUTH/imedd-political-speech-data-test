But allow me to say a few words about your city, about Volos. Because I believe that it is time for justice to return to Volos, too. That is why I want to commit here in the port, since we are in the port, that we will review in terms of the public interest and, if necessary, cancel the privatisation process of the only large and profitable commercial port that has remained under public control. And we will return to your city municipality the portion of the land area that is its due. We will not allow LNG facilities within the Pagasitikos, because they pose a risk to the residential areas that exist along the entire coastline.
