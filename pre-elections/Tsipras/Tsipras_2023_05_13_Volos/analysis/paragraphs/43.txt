These are the questions that demand answers and these are the dilemmas. Because the time of crisis is coming for all of us from the Greek people and the next day the time of crisis will come for all of us in relation to what we seek for this country. Because simple proportional representation also means proportional responsibility for all.
Responsibility for how the country is governed. Some people cannot go back to the untruthful 'What a Plastira what a Papagos'. Some people cannot tell us that they are heirs to the legacy of Andreas Papandreou, but have a two-faced approach. For there has never been a two-fronted man in the forces of progress. The front has always been on the right. And now we have a front: On the worst right since the post-war period. The right of Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
