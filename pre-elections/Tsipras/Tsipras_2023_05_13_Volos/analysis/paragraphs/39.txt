But, friends, I want to say two things about the progressive forces of the country. I understand that we are in a competitive environment before the polls. But I want to ask directly: do they care what the next day will be like in the country, or do they say it doesn't matter, let whoever governs rule?Which is more beneficial, really? To stop the auctions of first homes together, or to tell people that the ruthlessness of the funds and the law that protects first homes are the same thing?
