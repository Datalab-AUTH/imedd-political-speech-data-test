But what Mr Mitsotakis is afraid as the devil is afraid to ask is not what the cost of our programme is, but what the cost of the injustice that the regime has been doing for four years now. And I wonder: what is the cost of four more years of collapsing public hospitals?
How much is it costing thousands of children to be left out of higher education with the barrier that has been put in place? How much did it cost to devalue the welfare state, to devalue the OSE that led to the tragedy of the Tempi? How much has this widening of inequalities cost? What is the cost of unpaid overtime? The undeclared work of young people? The 13th pension that was never given to pensioners? What is the cost of all this?
We now have both the knowledge and the experience. That is why we say to you, yes, now we know and we can. We know because we have learned from our mistakes. And we can because now is the first opportunity we are asking for to govern without the Troika, memoranda and coercion. The first chance we are asking for to govern on the basis of our own programme, to govern on the basis of our own wants and not on the shoulds.
