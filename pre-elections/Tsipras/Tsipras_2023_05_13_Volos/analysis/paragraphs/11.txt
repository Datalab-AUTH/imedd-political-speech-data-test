So I wonder, my friends, what will we be told in a week's time by these courtiers to justify the unjustifiable. Those who today are forcibly trying to convince us of this Mitsotakis current. They will start again with the familiar analyses of how this happened. About how we went from the Mitsotakis current to underground currents that we did not realise and, paradoxically, these underground currents all point towards Syriza. A terrible thing in every election.
But I call on you, with your decisive vote next Sunday, to deprive them of these excuses. That they may not be able to talk about underground currents, but that they may testify to a great river, a great river, a mighty river of change, a river of victory that will come to seal the victory of democracy, the victory of the people next Sunday.
Their tricks to create a climate are well known. Their tricks are well known. Look, because even in these terrible polls where they find a terrible current, there is always a trick. The percentage of undecideds is much higher than the percentage of difference. They're holding their butts. They know what they're doing. So we are telling them that at the ballot box the Greek people will bring out, not demographically, but really their desire, their vision, their vision to turn this country around and, above all, to change our lives and our everyday life.
