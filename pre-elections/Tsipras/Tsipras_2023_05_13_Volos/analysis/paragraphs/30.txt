So that's why we say to them: regardless of whether you have differences with SYRIZA - and it is known that you may have differences - in this ballot box you have to vote on the basis of morality and honesty and on the basis of who will govern us for another four years. Imagine if the arrogant Mr Mitsotakis gets a cover-up vote, a vote of tolerance, a vote of laundering, how many more will he watch over the next four years? How much deeper into authoritarianism he will lead our democracy. How much more will he widen inequalities, how much more will the powerful continue to enrich themselves and the middle class become poorer.
So we say to them, if you wish to punish Mr Mitsotakis, the vote that will punish him is the vote that will make him defeated. And the vote that will make him defeated is the vote for SYRIZA, which is the only force that can win and bring change.
