So I want to address those voters today, the conservatives, because I know that we have big ideological differences, but the majority of them are honest people and they are ashamed of the current leadership of their party. They are ashamed of the wiretapping scandal. And I ask myself: will you purge, will you cover up, will you become complicit with your vote in the rape of democracy? Mr Mitsotakis tells them: "vote for me". A vote for ND is a vote for a cover-up. It is a vote for impunity. It is a vote for four more years of more arrogance, more injustice, more arbitrariness. It is a vote for family rule.
