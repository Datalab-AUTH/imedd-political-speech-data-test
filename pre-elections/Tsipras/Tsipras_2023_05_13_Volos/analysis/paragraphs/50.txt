It's amazing how he spends hours and hours and hours and hours opposing himself. He dresses up as Syriza sometimes. He even throws away his tie and pretends to be Tsipras. But the Greek people have understood and the young people, the young children, have understood that he promised them EUR 150 to go and vote. Well, this attitude of arrogance, this attitude of dignity, will be paid for at the ballot box. He will pay for it at the ballot box. Because young people have dignity, they have dreams and they know that these dreams can only be realised by a major change in their lives.
So I want to ask you during these nine days not to stop spreading the message of victory everywhere. SYRIZA first in the elections means change. SYRIZA first in the elections means a progressive government the day after the elections. SYRIZA first in the elections means justice everywhere. Justice for all.
We vote with simple proportional representation, but also with simple logic and we call on all progressive and democratic citizens who want a significant change in their lives to take this step and with their vote to pave the way for a better tomorrow.
From your gathering here today I draw the conclusion: We are already ahead. Victory will be big next Sunday. And it will be even bigger as long as they cultivate and create the certainty that things are backwards. It will be an even bigger victory. It will be even greater the current of hope, of optimism, of change that we will bring with the vote of the Greek people next Sunday. 9 days left. Let's go hard for the great victory.
Be well. Thank you very much for this great gathering. Goodbye to you and to victory. Goodbye.
Anyone who had a doubt about who would win next Sunday in Magnesia, with this rally here, there will be no doubt. And with victory! Hello!
