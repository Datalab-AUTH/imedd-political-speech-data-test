Friends, citizens of Volos, our motto is justice everywhere. But this is our vision and our plan at the same time. And here in Volos one understands what the struggle for justice can mean. Volos is identified and Magnesia for the struggles for social justice. The first Labour Centre in the country was founded here in 1908. It was here that the historic tobacco workers' strike took place in 1909, which, despite the violent and bloody intervention of the gendarmerie, was victorious. It was here that the workers achieved better wages and shorter working hours through their struggles. In Magnesia, too, pages of heroism and sacrifice were written by the National Resistance. Again today here in Magnesia we will lead the struggle to bring justice back to our land.
