And your presence here today proves it. On May 21, Magnesia will once again put SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance first at the polls and pave the way for the great victory. It will pave the way for change. But I want to tell you that what we keep saying these days is that this May 21 vote is a vote for our lives. And this slogan, this slogan for change, is not a slogan that we say to rehash the slogans of yesterday. It is not a slogan that is about yesterday and the past. But it is a slogan that is about what is in the hearts and souls of the citizens of this country.
