So I would like to close, citizens of Volos, by asking you a favour in these few days left until the ballot box. In these few days left until the ballot box, let us not be complacent. Let us not listen to the sirens that want to distract us. Above all, let us not be complacent, because our opponents may not have arguments, which is why they hide from the debates and when they go to the debates they mess up. They may not have exactly what to say for all the four years they have been in power. I read a tweet today that Mitsotakis put out and it was like someone else had been governing for four years. He was saying, "no more cots in hospitals and lines in operating rooms." That's why we're going to increase health spending. What have you been doing for four years? Didn't you fix all that?
