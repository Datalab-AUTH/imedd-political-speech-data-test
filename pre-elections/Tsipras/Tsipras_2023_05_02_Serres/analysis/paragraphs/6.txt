So, we want to tell the citizens of Serres that this election, regardless of whether you are centrist, conservative, progressive, right-wing, left-wing, centrist, you have a great responsibility to show that your country does not deserve this heavy stigma. That your country can give the message of change, of progressive direction. That your country can give with its vote, not a cover-up, but a way out of the great problems we live in. And I said before that one of the reasons is that Serres has the heavy name but no favors were done to them, because for four years now they have been mired in abandonment.
