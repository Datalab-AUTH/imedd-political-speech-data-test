Friends, The choice of Mr.Mitsotakis and his former Minister Mr.Karamanlis, who is a candidate here, to finally run in this election is a policy that highlights hypocrisy and that they don't really care beyond their chairs. And that is deeply sad. It's a sad case. And I, if you want me to be clear, I have nothing personal. But I do believe that at some point we all have to work together to regain credibility in politics. One cannot resign supposedly out of emotion and take responsibility for a tragic accident and be in agreement with the Prime Minister to come back in 30 days. And we cannot have this theatre that we have seen these days after this tragic accident, with the responsibility of Mr Mitsotakis himself, who was blaming the stationmaster, who put on this show in front of the cameras with the non-existent television administration in Larissa and today, I think, he owes an explanation to the Greek people.
