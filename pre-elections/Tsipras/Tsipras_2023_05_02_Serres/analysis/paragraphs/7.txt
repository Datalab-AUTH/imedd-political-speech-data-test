What did Mr. Karamanlis, the Minister of Tempi, do for his region, for Serres, during these four years? What exactly happened? What I do know is that unemployment in your prefecture has climbed to 35%, according to data from the Labour Centre. What I do know is that accuracy is plundering the income of the middle class, that in a short time in Serres there will be only a few very rich and most of the poor. There will be no middle class. That all the people who live... Merchants, shopkeepers, craftsmen are groaning, their shops have no turnover.
