And I want to address mainly the young people and the young women, 450,000 more will vote now who were not able to vote in the previous elections. And to tell them this election may be a simple proportional representation election. But that does not mean that it is a loose vote election. A simple proportional representation election will produce a government.  A simple proportional representation election will most certainly give the opportunity to form a government on the evening of May twenty-first between the first and third parties. And the big question is which will be the first, in this election that will have the possibility of the first mandate, the exploratory mandate to form a government? Based on the indications, there are 2 possibilities. The possibility that it will be Syriza or New Democracy. So I appeal to all those citizens who say that this is as far as this country and our lives need a great change. I am addressing the 450,000 young voters, the working people who have seen their lives become a rubber band without rights. And I say to them, the only way to bring the much-needed change in their lives and in the governance of this country is to defeat the new democracy of Mr. Mitsotakis. It is for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance to win this election.
