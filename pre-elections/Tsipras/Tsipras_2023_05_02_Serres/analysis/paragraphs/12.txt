What we will say to you and what we will say to the Greek people is that we will not forget, not because we want to get political revenge. But because we believe that we must not forget, so that we never have to experience similar tragedies again. Because these tragedies are due, on the one hand, to the political hypocrisy and callousness to which I referred earlier and, most importantly, to political choices. We cannot discredit the public sphere. We cannot believe that everything can be done in partnership with private individuals and with privatisation. We cannot consider that this state will be such a hostile state to the citizen, without meritocracy, without accountability. We cannot go on like this with this party state, with the blue children getting jobs and the rest of the people being in poverty.
