So I want to thank you warmly for this very warm presence here in Serres. And let me tell you one more thing, let me tell you one more thing. We may not be from a family, but we have cared for your county even in lean times. During the period of the memoranda. When we were in government and we cared about Serres. We cared for Serres first of all, by doing some important projects in the county, by strengthening the local health unit in the public hospital, by building the Local Health Unit here in Serres. We are the ones who left integrated in the NSRF program. In the NSPA program, the local, the local land improvement agency in Nigrita and 4 years now nothing has been done on the projects. The needed infrastructure projects in the area. We are the ones who built the bridge project in Blackfish at the mouth of the Drymona River. We are the ones who built the sewage works in the area of Nigrita in the municipality. We are the ones who secured the funds, five and a half million to build the indoor swimming pool in the municipality here in the town of Serres.
