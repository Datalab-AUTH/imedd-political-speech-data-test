A week ago the experts' conclusion came out. The experts appointed by Mr Mitsotakis himself. Which says that there has been no telecommunications at this particular spot since July 19, because there was a fire. Four years they couldn't restore it. And it also says not the finding, but the judiciary itself with its criminal prosecution of the former chairman of the OSE, and those responsible for the transfers, that these transfers were made illegally. Why? Because the stationmaster did not meet the age limit and Mr. Karamanlis came later with a ministerial decision to legalize it. So Mr Mitsotakis, and Mr Karamanlis, who is claiming the vote of your fellow citizens and wants a whole law to make him an accomplice, owe an answer. Whose buffoonery was this fatal stationmaster after all? Whose buffoonery was he? Untrained, unqualified. 57 human lives demand an answer.
