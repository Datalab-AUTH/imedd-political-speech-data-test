The fourth reason, I said 3 + 1, is because I believe that it is unfair for the people of Serra, unfair for the people of Serra, that some people want the people of Serra to be the one who will wash away the great tragedy, a crime that must not be forgotten, the tragedy of Tempe. It is unfair that the people of Serra and your prefecture should be mentioned in these elections in relation to Karamanlis of Tempe. I honour the conservative voters and I also honour the political family, the one that has given important things to the country. But family democracy sometimes, and this is instructive for every citizen no matter what they vote for, family democracy can lead us to situations that are not only deeply conservative and unjust, but also dangerous. Because when someone with only their surname as a resource takes on positions of responsibility and manages human lives, this condition of familism can become dangerous, not only deeply conservative and unjust.
