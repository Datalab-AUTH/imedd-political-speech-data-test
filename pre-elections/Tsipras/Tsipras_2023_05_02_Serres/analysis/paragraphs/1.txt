Citizens of Serres, thank you for this warm welcome. Today here in Serres we are proving that there are no impregnable castles. Today here in Serres, we are proving that the time for change has come, the time has come to say enough is enough, enough with the accuracy, enough with the disparagement, enough with the targeting, enough with the obscenity, enough with the family rule, enough with the injustice. I would like to thank you for this welcome and, above all, I would like to ask you to join me in this good, good fight in the days leading up to the ballot box. This struggle to put forward needs and rights, to put forward our lives, the prospects of this country. I am happy and proud that this is the fight that I will personally give here from the prefecture of Serres as a candidate in the prefecture of Serres. And I am proud and happy about it and I want to explain to you the 3+1 important reasons why I decided one of my candidacies to be here in Serres.
