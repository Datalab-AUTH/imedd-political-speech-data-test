A health care system that can treat citizens with dignity, regardless of their income, an education system and above all an education system that can give prospects to all children and not barriers to knowledge, as Mrs Kerameos has done, who has set the minimum admission base and every year 20,000 students are cut off from admission to higher education institutions so that children go to college to give the clientele to colleges. That is what we have committed to and I want to commit to today because I know that the majority of the children who are cut off by these barriers are children from the periphery and the grassroots. From these national examinations I address the young people who are fighting their battle now and are at home studying and doing well and I wish them success. From these national examinations, with a progressive government, the minimum admission basis will be abolished and 20,000 more children this year will be able to enter higher education institutions.
