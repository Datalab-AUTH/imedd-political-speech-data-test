So I want to address the young people, the young people, the workers, who yesterday we had Labour Day, Mr Mitsotakis thought that Labour Day was for flowers. He does not know what it means. He went to a flower show. When it is the living history of our people's struggles, our people's struggles for progress. So I want to address the workers who have seen the eight-hour day abolished in practice, overtime unpaid, just cause dismissal delegitimised. Who have seen flexible working hours turn their lives into a rubber band.
