As long as you have seen it, we have also seen 4 years of devaluation for Serres. Well, the time has come for the people of Serres to turn their backs on those who have turned their backs on them for 4 years.

So let's go for a great victory for great change. Hello. Thank you very much for your presence. Hello!
