What I also know about your county is that it is a county that has a very large migration of young people in particular who cannot find work here and leave. So what we all need to do together for this law is to highlight that you cannot have just the name, a heavy name, a heavy history. You have to have a presence. You have to have a future. We have to work together so that the people of Serra can find an impact through policies that give them rights and prospects.
