So imagine if SYRIZA had been able to spend 60 rather than the 40 that the country would be today? It would have public hospitals, it would have schools with teachers, it would have decent universities, it would protect jobs. It would have had a welfare state, it would have protected the small and the weak from this horrific accuracy. Therefore, we appeal to the Greek people and say. We are not asking for a second chance, but the only chance to govern on the basis of our programme. Because in the previous four years we governed on the basis of constraints but also on the basis of the national objective, the obligation to get the country out of the grip of memoranda and bankruptcy. So we want to say that we have to look all citizens in the eye. It can be difficult to perform miracles and we are not promising to perform miracles. But we do promise that we will do everything in our power to bring back to this country justice, justice at work. Justice in the welfare state, justice everywhere.
