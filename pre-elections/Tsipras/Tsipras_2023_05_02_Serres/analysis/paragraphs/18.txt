The government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis has left us with 50 billion more in public debt, 40 billion more in private debt and a current account deficit that is 10 times higher than before. Than it was in 19, i.e. exports minus imports. We have increased imports 10 times over exports in this four year period. But it was a government that had the leeway. Because of the pandemic. To spend more than 50, 60, they say billions of euros. We in the four-year period 15-19 had the obligation, not the leeway to spend 60, but the obligation to raise 40 to get the country out of the spiral of bankruptcy, into which other governments threw it, other governments threw it.
