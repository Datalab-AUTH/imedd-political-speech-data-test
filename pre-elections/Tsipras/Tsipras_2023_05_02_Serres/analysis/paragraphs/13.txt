So I want to address not only the progressive but also the conservative citizens here in Serres today and speak to the heart of even the Berber neo-democrats. They do not deserve this image for their party that has honoured the country. It is an embarrassing image. So it is time for them to take the step to support the future. The step to support the lives of their children. The step to support their county. The step of big change. SYRIZA comes to this election with a program that is well-established, well-constructed, which I want you to keep in mind has mainly 4 main axes. They are wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair and efficient state. This is what a vote for SYRIZA means.
