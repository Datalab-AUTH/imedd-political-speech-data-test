I know that your general hospital had a record number of deaths during the pandemic and is abandoned. It has 160 doctors, and today it's down to 80 doctors. It's unthinkable that it's at half its intended staff. So what I do know is that there are fewer doctors in your hospital today, adjuncts, mostly permanent and adjuncts, than we had left before the pandemic came.
