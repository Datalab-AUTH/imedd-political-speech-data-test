And we respond, and we also respond to Mr Androulakis, who the day before yesterday told us for the first time so clearly that those responsible for the parastate must be held accountable. How exactly will they be held to account? With Mr Mitsotakis back in government? Is there any chance of there being a catharsis of public life for the scandal that he orchestrated, if the new democracy is back in government? So, that is why we also appeal to our friends of PASOK-Kinal. To the democratic progressive citizens, but also to the conservative citizens, those who are ashamed of what their current leadership is doing, because there are thousands of honest New Democrats who have ideological differences but who do not tolerate this undemocratic behaviour, the rape of democracy. And we say to them, Mr Mitsotakis is asking you for a blank cheque, to be washed away with your vote, to be an accomplice and at the same time, to Mr Androulakis, he is asking you to wash him away with your support.
