Citizens of Igoumenitsa and Thesprotia, for 4 years now you have known first-hand what abandonment and devaluation means. For 4 years now your law has in fact been off the map. And I would like to say a few words about what has happened, about what has not happened in these four years, but I do not know where to start, where to begin and where to end. Let me start with your port, which has been sold off without any real consideration, which we have been asking for many, many days now to give us the concession contract and they have done everything in opacity and they don't say, they don't show what exactly they sold and what exactly they got? The port of Igoumenitsa, the marina in Plataria and Sivota, the fishing shelter in Sayada and, most importantly, they do not tell us why, even what they were forced to support after our pressure and commitments, the concession of the port's land area to the citizens of Igoumenitsa. Why are they not implementing it?
