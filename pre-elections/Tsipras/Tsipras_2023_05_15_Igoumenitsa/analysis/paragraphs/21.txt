He said the day before yesterday that "I have fully respected my programme". He has more to do. He has to privatize water. He has to completely privatize public hospitals. He has to plunder the young generation by sending young people abroad as immigrants, by maintaining the minimum admission basis for university admission and by further devaluing universities, both public and regional, to give patronage to colleges. And it has one more thing to do: to continue the great redistribution of wealth with subsidies going directly to support the energy, food, refinery companies and cartels, but it has another great redistribution to do, not income redistribution, which it has done and will continue to do, but wealth redistribution the greater redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the powerful, with the auctions of first homes. 700,000 properties, 700,000 households are currently in the clutches of the funds. This is the plan he wants to complete. And the question I want to ask you is will you let him? The question I ask you is on Sunday, May 21, will you let this happen by voting loosely?
