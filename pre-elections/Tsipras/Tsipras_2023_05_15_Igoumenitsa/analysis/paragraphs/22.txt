So on May 21, there is no loose vote. There is a vote for our lives. There is a vote for change. There is a vote that will deliver progressive government the next day and that is a vote for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance. And I want to tell you one more thing. Your county became a single-member electoral district because of the aging demographic. Next Sunday, it will be the SYRIZA member of the Greek Parliament, the New Democracy member of the Greek Parliament. And I want to address all those who have a dilemma about what to vote for, especially here in Thesprotia and want to stand outside the choice of the two major parties. I want to tell them that next Sunday night is very important. Who will be here in the streets of Thesprotia and Igoumenitsa to celebrate. Will the democratic people, will the democratic progressive citizens of Igoumenitsa be celebrating, or will the known interests be celebrating, or will the cartels be celebrating, or will the privileged, the day labourers, the buffoons, all those who have been favoured for four years now, while the vast majority of your people have seen their income shrink and cannot make it through the month in the third week?
