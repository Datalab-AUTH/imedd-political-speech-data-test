I made a commitment to them that I will do everything in my power to get justice, not to get revenge on someone, but so that we do not have another accident like this, such a tragedy. But I want to tell you that even worse than the tragedy, the causes that led us to the tragedy, which are well known, is the devaluation of the railways, the minister who, in Parliament, was shaming the SYRIZA Members of Parliament when they told him that the railways have been devalued and that we will suffer victims, a week before the incident, the 3 outlaws of the workers who announced this tragic accident, but worse than all this, the terrible responsibilities, is the management that Mitsotakis himself did afterwards. Just 15 days ago he went on the television and said that Tempe was a minor damage that we have overcome. Really, really, is the loss of 57 people a decay and a political cost? But that is how they perceive human life. For them, profits come before people and lives. For us, people's lives are above profits, and that is the great moral difference that we have with Mr Mitsotakis's new democracy. They were setting up performances in front of an ... an antiquated console and saying that this is television administration. Remember how it burned down in '19 and they never restored it? We were told that one man was to blame and it was an accident - except that this man, untrained, unqualified, was appointed by party buffoonery, because that's what they've been taught. This is the state they have created. The spoils state, the spoils state, the spoils state, partisan.
So we are saying that it is time to draw a red line in all this and it is time to create a state with accountability, with meritocracy, not a state that is partisan, a spoils system.
