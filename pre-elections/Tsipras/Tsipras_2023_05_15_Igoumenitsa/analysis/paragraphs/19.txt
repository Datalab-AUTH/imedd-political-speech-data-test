So we answer them: we have been judged by the Greek people both for our honesty and for the fairness with which we managed the most difficult moment. We had an obligation to collect 40 billion in public funds and we left the public funds full of 40 billion, so that Mr Mitsotakis could eat from the ready-made funds. He was able to spend 60. You saw how and to whom. Imagine if we had that discretion instead of the obligation to raise 40, the discretion to spend 60 in fairness. Would these be the public hospitals today? Would this be what public schools would be like today? Would this be the welfare state? Would it be where pensions are today, would it be where obscenity is today, everybody knows what the answer is. Because no matter how much someone can accuse SYRIZA and me personally that we made mistakes, no one can accuse us of handling the sacrifices of the Greek people with dishonesty and expediency. So that is why we say today that we are not asking for a second chance. We are asking for a first chance to govern on the basis of our programme and not under the coercion of the Troika. A first chance to govern by our will and NOT by our needs.
