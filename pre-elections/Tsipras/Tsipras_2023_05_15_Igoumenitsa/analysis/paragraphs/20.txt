Citizens of Thesprotia and Igoumenitsa, I think that as the time comes, the great critical hour of change, fear changes sides. So I want to say one thing today to you who are listening to me, and especially to the young people. The result of the elections on the twenty-first of May, as we speak, is completely open. I want to be honest. And it is absolutely open because it depends on one thing: on how many people and who go to the polls to vote. If the 450,000 young people who are voting for the first time go to the ballot box, if our fellow citizens who want to cast a vote of punishment for what Mitsotakis has done over these four years go to the ballot box and do not decide to turn their backs on the elections, then you can be sure that there will not be enough days for him to pack up for Maximou, for Mr Mitsotakis to move. He should already start packing. Look at what is happening all over Europe and all over the world with the famous polls. I will not say whether they are true or false. I will say that it is the participation of the citizens that disproves them at the end of the day, and I ask you and the young voters to disprove the predictions that say that Mr Mitsotakis will have another four years of arrogance, indifference and targeting. Because you know what? He has not completed his programme.
