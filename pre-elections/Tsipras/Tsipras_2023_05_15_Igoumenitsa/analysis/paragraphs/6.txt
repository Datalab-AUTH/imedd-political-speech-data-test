What else can we remember about the devaluation of this law 4 years ago, apart from what I said about the rural world, about health, about the citizens here in Igoumenitsa, in relation to their port? For the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, shall we say? Who have seen their bills skyrocket? Debts choking them? Not even being able to get out of a bank, because banks only give loans to those who can prove that they don't need to take out a loan? What else can I remember?
