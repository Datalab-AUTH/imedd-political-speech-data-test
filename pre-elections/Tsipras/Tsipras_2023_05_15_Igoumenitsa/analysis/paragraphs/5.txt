Let us remember the devaluation of the people, the producers, the farmers and the farmers where I was in 2021,
I stood next to them. I went and met them, the tangerine producers, tangerine growers and they had the big issue then that they raised with me. That they weren't getting compensation for the wounds they had because of the bad weather. They never received any compensation, but now they are not even receiving the aid provided for by the OPECPEPE. And the big question for the farmers and producers in your county is no longer whether or not they will get any aid, but whether they will continue to stay in the countryside and produce in their own land, to have their fields, to sow them and their animals to produce cheese, milk, cheese to have the products, the livestock products, because the big question now is how they will bear the cost of production. The cost of production has skyrocketed. The energy costs have dragged all of them down. And what are they going to do now? How will they be able to stay in their country if the Mitsotakis government continues for another four years to give everything to the middlemen. 300 % is the difference between the prices that the producer sells in the field and what the consumer finds on the shelf.
