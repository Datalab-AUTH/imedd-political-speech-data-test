Two days ago I was in Trikala and I was asked to meet the tragic parents of the 3 girls, 2 twin girls and a cousin who were unjustly lost. They were unjustly lost in this terrible accident. And they said to me we ask you to pledge that our children will not be forgotten. This crime will not be forgotten. They wondered what exactly happened and a month now since the election season began the word Tempe is a banned word in the media. They are not highlighting their mobilizations, their agony, their agony to get justice.
