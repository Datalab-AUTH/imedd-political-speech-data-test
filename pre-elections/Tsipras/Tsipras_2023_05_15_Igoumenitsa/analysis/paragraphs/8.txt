And of course I must also remember the mockery, the great mockery of our fellow citizens from northern Epirus, who have had their pensions cut off. In 2012, Mr Samaras, then we came along, and once we came out of the memoranda, we restored it in 2019, and for four years now it has been frozen. 4 years now. And now they've opened up a platform for them to make statements. The mockery and hypocrisy at its peak.
