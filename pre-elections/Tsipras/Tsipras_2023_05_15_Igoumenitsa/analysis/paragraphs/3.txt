Let's remember, let's remember the new university department here that was created was a TEI and we made it a university department of translation and interpretation, which was established as a university department in 2018 with the reform of the higher education map and in 19 they closed it and Igoumenitsa is left without a department, without young children, without a university department and students. The city has now become a city that lacks the freshness and vitality of young people. What else can we remember?
