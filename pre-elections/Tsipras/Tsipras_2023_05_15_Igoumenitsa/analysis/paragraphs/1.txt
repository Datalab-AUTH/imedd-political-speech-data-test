Citizens of Igoumenitsa, thank you very much for this great welcome, for this great gathering, in broad daylight, here in Igoumenitsa. I am very touched by the reception you have given me.
And this reception, this rally, like other rallies we have held all these days, shows the true show of victory. A few days from today, six days from now, next Sunday, it will not be the cartels and the vested interests who will be celebrating, it will be the ordinary people, the people who will be celebrating the victory of democracy, the return of justice to our land. And we will not deny anything in particular. We all know it. We all know what the reality is, because we see it by talking to the people every day, the citizens of toil, the people of creation, the producers, the farmers, the stockbreeders, the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. There is no longer anyone who does not want a great change in their lives, a great change in their everyday life, more justice and prosperity. That is why I believe that what we call 'change' is no longer a slogan. It is an expectation, it is a hope, it is a feeling of jubilation for the great majority of our people. Because people are now saying one thing. That's it. No more obscenity. Enough of family rule. Enough of inequality. Enough with the indifference. Enough of the arrogance of power and enough of injustice.
