Do you know how hard it is to gather all the evidence of a crime? Do you know how hard it is to rip out the wires of the Predator that was tracking half of Greece? Do you know how hard it is? But from Monday, the Megaron Maximou will belong to democracy and not to the parastate. From Monday, the Megaro Maximou will become a headquarters for the relief of society, for the support of society, for the recovery of the economy. To bring justice back to our country. But while I'm on the subject of surveillance, this great scandal. You will recall that Mr Mitsotakis avoided like the devil avoided incense and still avoids joining me, the two of us, face to face, in a televised debate. Many wondered, but why? Those who had the slightest doubt as to why, figured it out when they saw the debate last week, even with 6 participants. In the first tough question, he single-handedly confessed what he had been diligently hiding for 9 months, that the illegal surveillance was a scandal and that there was no, but no national reason for the political system, half of the political system, to be monitored.
