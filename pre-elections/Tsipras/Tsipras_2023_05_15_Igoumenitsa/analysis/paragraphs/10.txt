So we are committed to reversing this course, this reality. We want to work for the many and especially the weak, the middle class. Remember what they told you in '19, that they would come to support the middle class. And what has the middle class become today? Living on food stamps. Coupons to go to the supermarket, coupons to pay the electricity bills, coupons to go to the gas station to get gas. Our lives have become a pass. A pass for every use. Pass, pass, pass, pass, but you're not going anywhere. So it is time for us to give Mr Mitsotakis a pass and say to him 'it is time to go home'. But I think that these days Mr Mitsotakis must be very busy. He is making his last trips from one end of Greece to the other in the state plane, because from next Monday he will not be able to use it. And he's also very busy there at Maximus.
