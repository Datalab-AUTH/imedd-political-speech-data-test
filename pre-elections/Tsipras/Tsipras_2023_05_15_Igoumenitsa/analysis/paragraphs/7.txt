But I think the most important thing to say about your place is that it is a demographically ageing place. The villages in the municipalities, in the municipality of Filiata and in the municipality of Souliou, are villages that are actually becoming ghosts, as time goes by and they become ghosts, because people in the periphery cannot have a basic income, they cannot have a future, they cannot have a perspective. So who is going to provide answers to all this?
