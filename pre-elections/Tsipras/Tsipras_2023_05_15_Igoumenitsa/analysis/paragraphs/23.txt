Well, I call upon you to do whatever you need to do in these six days that are left. House by house, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, café by café, village by village, so that next Sunday the democratic people of Igoumenitsa can celebrate. They should celebrate because they will send a progressive, democratic MP to the Parliament and celebrate with the whole of Greece, because the great change that society and the Greek people so desperately need will come. Be well. Thank you very much for this great rally, which is a victory performance in Thesprotia too. Goodbye! Good strength! Bless you.
