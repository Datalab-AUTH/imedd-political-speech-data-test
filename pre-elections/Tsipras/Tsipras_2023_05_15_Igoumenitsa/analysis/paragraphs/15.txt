The only possibility for a catharsis is for Mitsotakis to be defeated in the elections and this will happen with the great victory of SYRIZA and the formation of a progressive government from the day after the elections. So some people cannot say the culprits in jail, but equal distances between SYRIZA and New Democracy. There are no culprits in jail, but we can also cooperate with the high priest of wiretapping. So we want to give a clear answer to the Greek people today. The elections on the twenty-first of May are in fact a strong decision on whether justice will be done in our country and on the crucial issue of the wiretapping, but it is also a strong decision on whether justice will be done in our country and on another major crime that took place two months ago and that some people want to forget.
