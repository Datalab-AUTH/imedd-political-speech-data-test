So we. I want to address the citizens of Thesprotia and say that we do not believe that there are second-class citizens. In the most difficult circumstances, we did everything we could to put this law back on the map. And we did everything we could, not only with major development projects, but also with small everyday projects. We gave 21 million only through the Philodemos 1 and 2 programmes to the municipalities of Thesprotia. If there is a bulldozer still operating in your prefecture today, it is because four years ago the SYRIZA government gave funding to local government to do projects. But 4 years ago absolutely nothing happened and what is worse? They excluded Thesprotia from the Recovery Fund, from the billions of the Recovery Fund, because the doctrine of the Mitsotakis government is that all resources should go to the few and powerful. All resources to the centre and nothing for the periphery.
