I want to address mainly the young people, the young voters, who will be close to 450,000 in this election. The regime that governs us, the regime that wants to control our lives to earn more, wants you to not go to the polls. They are not trying to convince you that those who rule us are good, but that they are all the same, that nothing will change with your vote. If we have one message to get across to all young people, it is that they should not give away an important weapon that they have, and their weapon is their vote. The vote is your weapon, don't give it away. And remember: the most decisive blow to the establishment and to the Mitsotakis regime that has been targeting you for four years now, the most decisive blow is the one that will hurt the establishment and it will be hurt by one thing: the defeat of New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis. And the defeat of New Democracy cannot exist without a victory for Syriza. There is no victory of the people without a victory of SYRIZA. There is no victory of the democratic majority without a victory of SYRIZA. The greater this victory, the more certain will be the progressive government from 22 May, without the adventure of successive elections that Mr Mitsotakis is seeking.
