Is it a realistic goal to reduce prices? We say: yes, it is realistic and they have succeeded, they have restrained accuracy in other countries of the European Union by reducing the Value Added Tax on food and essentials. In Spain they even had zero VAT on basic consumer goods. And of course by reducing the excise duty on fuel to the lowest possible rate set by the European Union and abolishing the excise duty on agricultural oil.  
The public purse can bear this cost, all the more so as the price reduction will result in an increase in purchasing and government revenue. While it will be a huge relief for the popular strata and the middle class. 4.5 billion was the excess revenue to public coffers in 2022 - the "state obscenity" as I often say - from maintaining high VAT, while prices climbed uphill.
