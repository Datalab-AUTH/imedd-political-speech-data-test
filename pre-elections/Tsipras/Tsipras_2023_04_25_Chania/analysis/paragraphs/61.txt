I want to address mainly the young people, the young voters, who will be close to 450,000 in this election. The regime that governs us, the regime that wants to control our lives to earn more, wants you to not go to the polls. They are not trying to convince you that those who rule us are good, but that they are all the same, that nothing will change with your vote.
If we have one message to get across to all young people, it is that they should not give away an important weapon that they have, and their weapon is their vote. The vote is your weapon, don't give it away.
