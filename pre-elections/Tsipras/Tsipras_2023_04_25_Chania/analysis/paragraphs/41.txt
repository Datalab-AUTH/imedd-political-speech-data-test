Citizens of Chania, I have tried to present as briefly as possible our plan for today and tomorrow. The road we are taking together for justice was the one I have described to you. But no plan is enough, no drawing - as I am an engineer - is not enough, if you do not have the digging machines to pave the road, the bulldozers, so to speak. To open this road, to put the country on this road, we need your participation, the bulldozers of the people. You will put the bulldozers in with your vote. You need the undisputed and clear victory of Syriza in the elections, that is the precondition. And I want to close by explaining this a little bit. There can be no relief from the regime we have been living in these four years, there can be no change in the country, there can be no prospect of a progressive government and a return to justice without a victory for SYRIZA. That's what the math says, but mostly that's what political thought says. There is no breathing room and no prospect if Syriza does not win, and this is not a figure of speech, this is not a rhetoric of election rhetoric. It is a reality that we have to keep in mind.
