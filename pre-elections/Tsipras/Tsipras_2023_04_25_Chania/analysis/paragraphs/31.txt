But from here, from Chania, from Crete, I have a message to send to Mr Mitsotakis: Mr Mitsotakis, you have a message from Crete. The day is coming when the voices of the many will join in a river of justice, of the families who have unjustly lost their people in the pandemic, of the workers who work unpaid twelve-hour days, of the small and medium-sized businesses whose lives are being dynamised by the debt collectors, of the householders whose homes are endangered by the Patsis, of our children who are studying for the Panhellenic exams these days and are dreaming and have been cut off by Mrs. Kerameos, but they have a vote, they have the right to vote and they will respond, the young people who insist on dreaming and resisting. The many want change. The many are the ones who will evict Mr Mitsotakis and Mitsotakis SA. that governs us from the Mansion in a few days.
