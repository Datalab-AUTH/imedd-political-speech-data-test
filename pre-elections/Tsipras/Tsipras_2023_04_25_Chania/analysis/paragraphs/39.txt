Finally, is it realistic to have a strong, effective National Health System that gives people, citizens decent care, decent treatment? We say, yes, it is. It can't be done overnight, but, yes, it is with a plan and with resources. First of all because there is nothing more realistic and necessary, in a modern democratic society, than protecting people's health and life. No cost compares to the cost of a life needlessly lost, and we have seen many lives needlessly lost in recent years. And of course we are saying that it can be done by supporting the people who are in the National Health System and keeping it upright, the people who are making superhuman efforts of doctors and nurses, by giving incentives to young people to young doctors by increasing salaries, but at the same time by giving tenure to all those who were in the difficult moments of the pandemic and who fought the battle for human life.
