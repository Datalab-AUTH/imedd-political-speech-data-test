But I deeply believe that if we take this matter into our own hands, if each of us becomes the change and justice we want for our country, if we oppose logic, sensitivity, arguments, perseverance, then no propaganda, no fake reality, no provocation, will thwart this current of change.
I want to call upon you in the days that are left together in every village, in every home, to bring the message of victory, to bring the message of change. To go to the ballot box with the confidence of victory. Chania today is showing this path of optimism and great change. The message you are sending is a powerful message of victory and change, I urge you not to waste time, not to waste a moment.
