Is it a realistic goal to increase after 14 years - that's how long they haven't seen an increase!- the salaries of civil servants by 10% we say, as much as inflation in the previous year? Yes, it is realistic, we reply. Because the economy can bear it. The ten billion distributed in direct awards would not only be enough for decent salaries in the public sector for years, not just for one year, it would be enough for more. Increased salaries in the public sector means greater productivity, better relations with the citizen, and of course a boost to demand and the market.
