So now that the whole Greek people have been taught for four years, especially Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the time has come for the whole Greek people to follow the example of their compatriots. Because the country needs a prime minister who is responsible, not a prime minister who did not know - that is to say, a prime minister who did not know - not a prime minister who does not care.
Because if you were to ask me to find a description of Mr Mitsotakis over these four years, that is exactly what I would say: he does not care. He does not care about society, he does not care about the people, he does not care about today and tomorrow and he has been constantly trying to deceive the citizens with communication tricks for four years now, and he has proved it many times.
