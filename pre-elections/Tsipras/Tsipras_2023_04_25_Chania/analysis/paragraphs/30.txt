He apparently has no answers about illegal surveillance.  You remember every time I questioned him in the House, he either didn't come or whenever he was forced to come, he would shut down the debate himself and run away. He took on the role of the Speaker of the House! He has no answers for the crime in Tempe, nor for the tragedy of the pandemic. He wants all that to be forgotten. And only discuss Varoufakis, Velopoulos and Kasidiaris. To discuss anything else, except the big issues in front of us and except his responsibilities because he has been ruling for four years, he didn't become prime minister yesterday, we weren't ruled by a doppelganger.
