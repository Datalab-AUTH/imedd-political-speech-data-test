We did not fight the battle with the people to apologise for having put the country under the memoranda, we fought the battle and got the country out of the memoranda. We fought with the people to get rid of them. Did Mr Mitsotakis fight this battle, back when he was shouting 'Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim and Shoeble'? That is the level of the election debate. And it is a panic choice that he is making. And his panic is even greater, you know, because this time he knows that this time he will not find any allies to support any Schäuble or any Geroun, because even there in Germany there is no Schäuble.
But there is a Chancellor whom I visited the day before yesterday and who is giving the green light to the prospect of a progressive government in Greece that will pursue a policy other than that of increasing, of widening inequalities. A policy of supporting society and boosting the economy.
But what else was Mr Mitsotakis telling us in 2019? He was telling us that the middle class would see bright days under his administration. And what did he do? He promised to bring it up to the big salons and eventually plunged it into living on food stamps. That's what he did.
