Let me give you two typical examples that show how we understand problem solving and how Mr Mitsotakis, who is also a compatriot of yours and who is supposed to take care of Crete and Chania. In April '19, under the SYRIZA government, a protocol of cooperation was signed between the Ministry of National Defence and the Municipality of Chania, which provided for the concession of 54 acres of the Markopoulou Camp to the Municipality of Chania. On these 54 acres we had a plan to create, among other things, green spaces and infrastructure for sports, culture and social welfare. The transfer of the military installations to another site was then financed with EUR 1 300 000 and, under the agreement signed, it should have been completed within 15 months. The New Democracy Government not only failed to complete any agreement in 15 months, but broke every record: it managed to leave it incomplete for four years and only complete it this year. And what is Mr Mitsotakis doing now? He appears to the citizens of Chania with audacity, presenting as his own plan and his own project, what others worked out, others decided and others financed. And his only contribution was to delay it for four whole years.
