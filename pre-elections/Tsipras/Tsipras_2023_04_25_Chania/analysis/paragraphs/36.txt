In this election, friends, citizens of Chania, it is the first time we will vote with an electoral system that will not steal the vote of the citizens. What you vote for will come out in Parliament, what you vote for will be matched by fairness in Parliament. We will vote for the first time with a system of proportional representation. Which means that there will be no bonuses and no tricks to baptize minority governments as self-reliant. But that does not mean that this election is the election of the loose vote.
