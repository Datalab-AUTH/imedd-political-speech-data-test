So we know what needs to be done and how it needs to be done. But many are wondering: Can you do what you say you can do, when you are up against powerful interests, interference and corruption? I answer, we answer, without reservation: yes, we can. But on one condition: you will not delegate them to us, we will achieve them together. With the vote, but also with the support of the Greek people. The answer to the question "Can you?" is: yes, we can, if you can. Side by side we can move forward and succeed in bringing justice back to our country. We did not meet today or yesterday, friends. We have been together in the most difficult moments that Greek society and the country have faced and we have succeeded, unlike others. Now, without any more memoranda, without troikas and constraints, we will prove that we can do even better. That is why I have often said and will say it again today: the opportunity we are asking for to govern is not a second chance. It is the first chance to govern without constraints, without memoranda, without the Troika over our heads. It is the first chance to implement our own programme, our own plan. And this is not a great opportunity for Syriza. Let me say that it is a great opportunity for society and for Greece.
