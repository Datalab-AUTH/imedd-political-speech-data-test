And the next day will be a new day for democracy, for justice, for our country. The dawn of change is coming, and I think your gathering today testifies to that. It is a message that today's gathering is a message. And it is a message because it can be directly compared to previous rallies that have taken place in this place and we don't have the stage effects. There are more of us in the squares, there are more of us in the streets, there will be more of us at the polls.
