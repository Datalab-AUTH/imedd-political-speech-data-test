Today, when our country is at a critical crossroads, we are called upon to respond to the great dilemmas that lie ahead of us: Will we live another four years under this cruel, as it turned out, Mitsotakis regime? Another four years under the worst right-wing of the post-revolution?  
Are we going to live another four years of offspring, offspring, nephews, courtiers and cronies, sharing and sharing the clothes of our people? Another four years when the state, electricity, electricity, health, education, even water, the breath at the end of society, will be owned or given away to the elite of privilege, speculation or the blue party? Or will we give our country a chance? A chance for change, progress, honesty, fair and effective government, democracy and justice? A chance, I would say, to dignity!
