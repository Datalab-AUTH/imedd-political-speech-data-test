And let me try to describe these dilemmas in pictures. On election Sunday night, who will be celebrating? Mr Mitsotakis? The firemen, the barons of the interconnection, the funds and the crows that grab people's houses, the patsis and the oligarchs of the corrupt elite, or will ordinary citizens, regardless of whether they are Left, Centre or Right, be celebrating? The citizens who want to take a deep breath, those who see their lives crushed between unaffordable prices, humiliating wages, between fears and foreclosures. The workers of poverty, the young people looking for a future of creation, the middle class that was promised palaces in 19 and has been reduced to living on vouchers today. It is to these dilemmas, to these big 'yes' and big 'no' that citizens will be called upon to answer in less than a month. And it is not words that will convince them of one or the other. It is the deeds. First of all, the deeds of the Mitsotakis administration over these four years.
