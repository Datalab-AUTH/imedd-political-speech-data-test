Is it a realistic goal to raise the basic wage to 880 euros and to introduce an annual indexation, so that every year when inflation rises, the wage rises? We say: yes, it is realistic. Because this will not only support thousands of households, but will also stimulate demand, revitalise the market and create jobs. Is it a realistic goal to increase after 14 years - that's how long they have not seen an increase! - the wages of civil servants by 10%, which we say is as realistic as the inflation in the previous year? Yes, it is realistic, we reply. Because the economy can bear it. The ten billion distributed in direct awards would not only be enough for decent salaries in the public sector for years, not just for one year, it would be enough for more. Increased salaries in the public sector means greater productivity, better relations with the citizen, and of course a boost to demand and the market.
