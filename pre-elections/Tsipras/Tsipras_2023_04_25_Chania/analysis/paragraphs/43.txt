I want to invite you all to take the lead in this struggle for the great victory, for the great change. Don't listen to those who try to scare you with lies. Governments are formed by the winners not the losers and that is what they are afraid of. They are afraid that we will be winners. We are sure we will be winners! I urge you to make this great change your own. Victory and change will not be given away especially by a system of power that knows full well that if it loses, it will lose a lot. It will not be given away. SYRIZA is feared and fought by all means. SYRIZA is the antithesis of the corruption, the corruption, the takeover of the state by partisanship, by favouritism and big interests. But I deeply believe that if we take this cause into our own hands, if each of us becomes the change and justice we want for our country, if we oppose reason with sensitivity, arguments, perseverance, then no propaganda, no fake reality, no provocation will thwart this current of change. I want to call upon you in the days that are left together in every village, in every home, to bring the message of victory, to bring the message of change. To go to the ballot box with the confidence of victory. Chania today is showing this path of optimism and great change. The message you are sending is a powerful message of victory and change, I urge you not to waste time, not to waste a moment. We are not the ones who have powerful interests on our side to fund us, we do not have powerful media on our side. But we have all of you on our side, the many and the many, the people of society, the people of creation, the people of work, we will put them in front and with them we will succeed in winning on May 21 and building a Greece of justice and progress.
