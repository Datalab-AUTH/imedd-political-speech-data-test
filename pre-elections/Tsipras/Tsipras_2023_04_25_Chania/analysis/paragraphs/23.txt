Second example: The BOAK. The Mitsotakis government wasted three whole years in order to find a way to redistribute the pie. It took three years to come up with the adoption of Syriza's original plan, with the only change being what? The imposition of tolls. Tolls to be paid not only by visitors to your island, but also by you Cretans. They delayed three years to come back to our plan with the toll difference, but they propagandize as if they are dealing with lotus eaters the project as their own. And the case has a future. Because from a government that has failed in four years to fix the problems created by the bad weather of 2019, no one can claim to ever complete the Northern Crete Highway. Now, friends, as I was coming on the plane, I asked a Chaniotee to explain to me why, over time, the Mitsotakis have not done well electorally in their homeland, Crete. And do you know what he replied? "But we know them, that's why we don't vote for them"! Well, now that the entire Greek people have been learning about them for four years, especially Kyriakos Mitsotakis, it is time for the entire Greek people to follow the example of their fellow citizens. Because the country needs a prime minister who is responsible, not a prime minister who did not know - that is to say, a prime minister who did not know - not a prime minister who does not care.
