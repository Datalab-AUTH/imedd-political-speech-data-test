So much for the mockery of pensioners. What did they tell us? That they would support the pensioners. And what did they do? They said it was peanuts, the 13th pension that Syriza introduced and gave, but they would keep it. They abolished it the very next day and of course they stole the retroactive payments, contrary to the decision of the Council of State.
Because for them, Justice and its decisions are a la carte. They only respect them when they feel like respecting them. When they don't want to respect them, they don't respect them and most of the time they don't want to respect them. Pensioners have lost a total of EUR 7 billion in these four years of the Mitsotakis government.
