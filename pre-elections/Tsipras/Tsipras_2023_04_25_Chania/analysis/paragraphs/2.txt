I want to begin my speech here today in front of you by recalling an old rhizitiko, the most characteristic of your land, which we always sing at all great struggles. Why should I remember it? Because I think it is what millions of our fellow citizens all over Greece are asking themselves: "When will it ever be clear!" So I bring you a message, because I am in almost all corners of our country these days and I meet citizens, regardless of what they voted for, and they come to me and say, "That's it! It is time for things to change!" I bring you the message that on 21 May it will be a new dawn in our country.
