Our vote on May 21 will bring out the government. That is why I want to ask one thing at this very important, very large gathering here in Chania: to ask you, and the Greek people, to ask you to give a strong mandate to SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance in the elections of May 21. A majority and a strong mandate to form a government of progressive cooperation on the very next day, which we want to be a strong and long-term government.
Mr Mitsotakis, in recent days, fearful that no matter what happens in 25 days he will leave the building he loved more than any other, the Maximou building, is trying to convey this fear to the citizens. To turn his own fear into the fear of the citizens.
