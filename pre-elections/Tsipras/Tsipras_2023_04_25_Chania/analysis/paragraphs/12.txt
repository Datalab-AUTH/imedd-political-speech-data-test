But as if that wasn't enough, we get the finger wagging. The day before yesterday, Mr Mitsotakis arrived to say that "SYRIZA put us in the memoranda"! and he got us out of the memoranda. You know, it would be laughable if it wasn't tearful! Because this is classic alt-right politics of the far right, of Trump, it's Trumpism personified to tell the biggest lie, as supposedly the truth. We did not fight the battle with the people to apologize for supposedly putting the country under the memoranda, we fought the battle and got the country out of the memoranda. We fought with the people to get rid of them. Did Mr Mitsotakis fight this battle, back when he was shouting 'Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim and Shoeble'? That is the level of the election debate. And it is a panic choice that he is making. And his panic is even greater, you know, because this time he knows that this time he will not find any allies to support any Schäuble and no Geroun, because even there in Germany there is no Schäuble. But there is a Chancellor whom I visited the day before yesterday and who is giving the green light to the prospect of a progressive government in Greece that will pursue a policy other than that of increasing, of widening inequalities. A policy of supporting society and boosting the economy.
