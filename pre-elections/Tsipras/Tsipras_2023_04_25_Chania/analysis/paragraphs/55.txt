We are not the ones who created this state of bribery, of corruption, of corruption and of interference. Others created it and created it for obvious reasons. We are neither the spawn, nor are we the ones who have the perception - which some princes who rule us have - that the state belongs to them. We believe that the state belongs to the people and that it must serve them. And that is why we are the only ones who can build a state at the service of the citizen. We can and must build a state that respects the citizen, that gives security.
