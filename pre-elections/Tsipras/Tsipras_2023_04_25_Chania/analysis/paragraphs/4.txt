Chanians,Every time I am in your city, every time I visit your place, every time I visit Crete, I feel great joy and emotion. Because Crete is in the body and blood of our history, in Crete one feels the timelessness of freedom. "When you fight for freedom, you are already better", wrote Nikos Kazantzakis.
These are our roots. From Therissos to the National Resistance, the democratic struggles, the anti-dictatorial struggle, the great fronts of change, the persons, parties, struggles and conquests of the democratic party are all traced by a red line. The line of freedom, democracy and justice.
This line runs through the entire Greek society today. And this line also runs through the vision, the programme, the policies of SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, the great force for change in our times.
