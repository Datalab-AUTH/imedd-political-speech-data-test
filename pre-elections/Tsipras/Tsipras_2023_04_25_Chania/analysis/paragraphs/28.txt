In this election, friends, citizens of Chania, it is the first time we will vote with an electoral system that will not steal the vote of the citizens. What you vote for will come out in Parliament, what you vote for will be matched by fairness in Parliament. We will vote for the first time with a system of proportional representation. Which means that there will be no bonuses and no tricks to baptize minority governments as self-reliant. But that does not mean that this election is the election of the loose vote. Our vote on May 21 will produce a government. That is why I want to ask one thing at this very important, very large gathering here in Chania: to ask you, and the Greek people, to ask you to give a strong mandate to SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance in the elections of 21 May. A majority and a strong mandate to form a government of progressive cooperation on the very next day, which we want to be a strong and long-term government.
