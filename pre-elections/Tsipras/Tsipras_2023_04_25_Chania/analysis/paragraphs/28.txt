The New Democracy government not only failed to complete any agreement in 15 months, but broke every record: it managed to leave it incomplete for four years and complete it only this year. And what is Mr Mitsotakis doing now? He appears to the citizens of Chania with audacity, presenting as his own plan and his own project, what others worked out, others decided and others financed. And his only contribution was to delay it for four whole years.
Second example: The BOAK. The Mitsotakis government wasted three whole years in order to find a way to redistribute the pie. It took three years to come up with the adoption of Syriza's original plan, with the only change being what? The imposition of tolls. Tolls to be paid not only by visitors to your island, but also by you Cretans.
They delayed three years to come back to our plan with the toll difference, but they propagandize as if they are dealing with lotus eaters the project as their own. And the case has a future. Because from a government that has failed in four years to fix the problems created by the bad weather of 2019, no one can claim to ever complete the Northern Crete Highway.
