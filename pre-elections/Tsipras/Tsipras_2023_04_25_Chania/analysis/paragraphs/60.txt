What is needed is an unquestionable and clear victory for SYRIZA in the elections, that is the precondition. And I want to close by explaining this a little bit. There can be no relief from the regime that we have been living in these four years, there can be no change in the country, there can be no prospect of a progressive government and the return of justice without a victory for SYRIZA. That's what the math says, but mostly that's what political thought says.
There is no breathing room and no prospect if Syriza does not win, and this is not a figure of speech, this is not a rhetoric of election rhetoric. It is a reality that we have to keep in mind.
