Now, without any more memoranda, without troikas and coercion, we will prove that we can do even better. That is why I have often said and will say it again today: the opportunity we are asking for to govern is not a second chance. It is the first chance to govern without constraints, without memoranda, without the Troika over our heads. It is the first chance to implement our own programme, our own plan.
And this is not a great opportunity for Syriza. Let me say that it is a great opportunity for society and for Greece.
Citizens of Chania, I have tried to present as briefly as possible our plan for today and tomorrow. The path we are taking together for justice was the one I have described to you. But no plan is enough, no drawing - as I am an engineer - is not enough, if you do not have the digging machines to pave the road, the bulldozers, so to speak. To open this road, to put the country on this road, we need your participation, the bulldozers of the people. You will put the bulldozers in with your vote.
