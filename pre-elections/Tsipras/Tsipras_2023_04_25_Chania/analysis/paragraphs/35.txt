Is it a realistic goal to reduce prices? We say: yes, it is realistic and they have succeeded, they have restrained accuracy in other countries of the European Union by reducing the Value Added Tax on food and essentials. In Spain they even had zero VAT on basic consumer goods. And of course by reducing the excise duty on fuel to the lowest possible rate set by the European Union and abolishing the excise duty on agricultural oil. The public purse can bear these costs, all the more so as the price reduction will result in an increase in purchasing and government revenue. While it will be a huge relief for the popular strata and the middle class. 4.5 billion was the excess revenue to public coffers in 2022 - the "state obscenity" as I often say - from maintaining high VAT, while prices climbed uphill. Why was he saving this money? To give subsidies during the election or even before, but targeted, not to stay in people's pockets, subsidies to the big energy companies, the big oil companies, the supermarkets to keep prices high in turn to keep them from going down, to egg their profits. Well, it will end with us! It will end this unequal redistribution of wealth, it will end obscenity it will end big super profits. This will lower prices for citizens, consumers and with controls, of course, on the market.
