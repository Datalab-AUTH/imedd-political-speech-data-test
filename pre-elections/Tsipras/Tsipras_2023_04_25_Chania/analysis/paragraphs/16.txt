The income for most of our fellow citizens, our middle-class citizens, disappears in the first three weeks of the month. The supermarket has become a nightmare. At petrol stations we have the most expensive price in the whole of Europe. Electricity eats up half a pensioner's pension, while small and medium-sized businesses cannot even get past the banks. And the resources of the Recovery Fund are all going to a few business groups that can be counted on the fingers of two hands.
Was the middle class avenged during the difficult years when the Syriza government was struggling to get the country out of the quagmire others had thrown it into?  Yes, it was wronged, it paid a disproportionate burden. But here there is a big difference with Mitsotakis' policy. His policy is not a national imperative, it does not serve a national goal as we did when we had to remove the noose of the memoranda and the Troika from the throat of every citizen and the country.
