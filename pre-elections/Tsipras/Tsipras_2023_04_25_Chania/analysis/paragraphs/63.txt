There is no victory for the people without a victory for SYRIZA. There is no victory of the democratic majority without the victory of SYRIZA. The greater this victory, the more certain will be the progressive government from May 22, without the adventure of successive elections that Mr Mitsotakis is seeking.
I want to call on all of you to take the lead in this struggle for the great victory, for the great change. Do not listen to those who are trying to scare you with lies. Governments are formed by the winners, not by the losers, and that is what they are afraid of. They are afraid that we will be winners.
We are sure we will be winners! I urge you to make this great change your own. Victory and change will not be given away, especially by a power system that knows full well that if it loses, it will lose a lot. It will not be given away.
