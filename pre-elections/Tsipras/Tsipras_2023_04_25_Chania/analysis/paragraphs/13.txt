And what did those four years, the excellent ones, supposedly, accomplish? We handed them a public debt of 340 billion euros and it has reached 400 billion euros. They increased the private debt by more than 40 billion euros, they increased the current account deficit tenfold. They spent, they say, over 55 billion to prop up the economy in the time of the pandemic. Watch out: Instead of having the obligation to raise money for the public coffers, they had the discretion to spend.
And the question is where did all those billions go? You know and we all know very well where they went. One look at the direct awards, the Pezza lists and the rampant obscenity is enough to tell us where they went.
