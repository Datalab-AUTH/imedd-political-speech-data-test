But what else was Mr Mitsotakis telling us in 2019? He was telling us that the middle class would see bright days under his administration. And what did he do? He promised to bring it up to the big salons and eventually plunged it into living on food stamps. That's what he did. Income for most of our fellow, middle-class citizens evaporates in the first three weeks of the month. The supermarket has become a nightmare. At petrol stations we have the most expensive price in the whole of Europe. Electricity eats up half a pensioner's pension, while small and medium-sized businesses cannot even get past the banks. And the resources of the Recovery Fund are all going to a few business groups that can be counted on the fingers of two hands. Was the middle class avenged during the difficult years when the Syriza government was struggling to get the country out of the quagmire others had thrown it into?  Yes, it was wronged, it paid a disproportionate burden.
