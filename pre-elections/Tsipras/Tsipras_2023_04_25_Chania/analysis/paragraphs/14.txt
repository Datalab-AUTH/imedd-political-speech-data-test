But here there is a big difference with Mitsotakis' policy. His policy is not a national imperative, it does not serve a national goal as we did when we had to remove the noose of the memoranda and the Troika from the throat of every citizen and the country. His policy is a plan, his plan: a plan to destroy the middle class for the benefit of the big interests, a plan to redistribute wealth from the many to the few and powerful, for the benefit of the cartels, the banks and the funds. And I have the feeling that the Greek people are beginning to understand this. People understand when they see 15 companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange with 20-year profitability records of over 1 billion each, when the vast majority of households cannot make ends meet for the month. These are the inequalities, this is the redistribution of wealth that Mr Mitsotakis is attempting. That is why the prevailing sentiment from coast to coast across Greece can be summed up, I believe, in just two words: Enough!
