If we, instead of having the obligation to collect 40 billion in public funds, had been able to spend 60, then everyone would have felt in practice exactly what the slogan we write on our flags and banners, what "Justice everywhere" means.
If we had that leeway, today our hospitals would be on their feet, social cohesion would have been strengthened, wages and pensions would have seen significant increases, the weak would have seen a white day, the welfare state would have been there to support people, education and culture would have received decisive support.
But none of this has happened. And society is sinking, the rich are getting richer, the middle classes are getting poorer and the poor are getting poorer.
But as if that wasn't enough, we get a finger wagging. The day before yesterday, Mitsotakis arrived to say that "SYRIZA put us in the memoranda"! and he got us out of the memoranda. You know, it would be laughable if it wasn't tearful! Because this is classic alt-right politics of the far right, of Trump, it's Trumpism personified to tell the biggest lie, as supposedly the truth.
