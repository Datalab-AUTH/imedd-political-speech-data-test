Finally, is it realistic to build a state that meets the expectations and demands of the citizen? A state that does not frighten citizens, not a state of fear, not a state of insecurity, not a state of bribery, not a state of injustice, not a state of injustice, but a state of justice and meritocracy, a modern and effective state. We say, yes, it is. We are not the ones who have created this state of bribery, corruption and interference. Others created it and created it for obvious reasons. We are neither the spawn, nor are we the ones who have the perception - which some princes who rule us have - that the state belongs to them. We believe that the state belongs to the people and that it must serve them. And that is why we are the only ones who can build a state at the service of the citizen. We can and must build a state that respects the citizen, that gives security. When we governed, you know, the police were not cooperating with crime, they were fighting crime. When we ruled, the National Intelligence Service was monitoring the Greek Mafia, today it is run by the Greek Mafia. That is our difference and the Greek citizen knows this.
