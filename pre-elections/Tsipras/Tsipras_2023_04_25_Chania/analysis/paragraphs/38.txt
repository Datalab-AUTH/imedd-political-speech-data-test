On the one hand, it is concerned with how to steal the deputies of one, on the other how to blackmail the other, and on the other how to exclude the third. He is doing all this to hide and, above all, not to talk about policies and programmes. He does not say a word about his programme, apart from those cheap copies I mentioned earlier.
And most importantly, while he goes out to the Greek people and says that the dilemma of this election is "Mitsotakis or Tsipras", he hides, he runs away, he doesn't even think about the idea, like the devil he wants to avoid a televised debate in front of the Greek people to present our positions, our programme, our proposals. Why is he doing this? He is doing this because he has no answers. He has no answers for the big issues, he has no answers for the obscenity that has his own stamp. Because he can tell us that precision is imported, but obscenity is made in Greece, it is Greek and has his own signature.
He has no answers, apparently, for the illegal surveillance.  You remember every time I asked him in Parliament, either he did not come or, whenever he was forced to come, he closed the debate by himself and ran away. He took on the role of the Speaker of the House!
