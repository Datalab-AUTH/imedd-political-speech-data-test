And the question is where did all those billions go? You know and we all know very well where they went. One look at the direct awards, the Pecha lists and the obscenity of obscenity is enough to understand where they went. If we, instead of having the obligation to collect 40 billion in public funds, had been able to spend 60, then everyone would have felt in practice exactly what the slogan that we write on our flags and banners, exactly what 'Justice everywhere' means. If we had that leeway, today our hospitals would be on their feet, social cohesion would have been strengthened, wages and pensions would have seen significant increases, the weak would have seen a white day, the welfare state would have been there to support people, education and culture would have received decisive support. But none of this has happened. And society is sinking, the rich are getting richer, the middle classes are getting poorer and the poor are getting poorer.
