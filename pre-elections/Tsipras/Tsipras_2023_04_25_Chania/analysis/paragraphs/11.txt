What did he tell us a few days ago? He says that simple proportional representation is a trap of Syriza, it does not harm New Democracy, it harms democracy. That's what he said. The man who is accused of having tapped hundreds of phones, half the political system, is now talking about traps for democracy.
The man who destroyed every notion of the rule of law, every notion of democratic legitimacy, who handed democracy over to the bugs, now appears to be protecting it, but from what? From the most honest, the purest electoral system: the simple proportional representation. In other words, from the equality of the vote of every citizen. If this is not extreme regime logic, an extreme hypocrisy, then words have lost their meaning.
