Mr Mitsotakis in recent days, fearful that no matter what happens in 25 days he will leave the building he loved more than any other, the Maximou building, is trying to pass this fear on to the citizens. To turn his own fear into the fear of the citizens. One, he is concerned with how to steal the deputies of one, the next with how to blackmail the other, the parallel with how to exclude the third. He is concerned with all this to hide and, above all, not to talk about policies and programmes. He does not say a word about his programme, apart from those cheap copies I mentioned earlier. And most importantly, while he goes out to the Greek people and says that the dilemma of this election is "Mitsotakis or Tsipras", he hides, he runs away, he doesn't even think about the idea, like the devil he wants to avoid a televised debate in front of the Greek people to present our positions, our programme, our proposals. Why is he doing this? He is doing this because he has no answers. He has no answers for the big issues, he has no answers for the obscenity that has his own stamp. Because he can tell us that precision is imported, but obscenity is made in Greece, it is Greek and has his own signature.
