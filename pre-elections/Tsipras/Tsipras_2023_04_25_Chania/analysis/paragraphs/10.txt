They were also talking in '19 about growth and the recovery of the economy. They took over from the SYRIZA government the economy out of the memoranda of bankruptcy that they put us under and into the markets, with a regulated debt, with twelve quarters of growth, with 37 billion in the public coffers, while we found them empty. That is what we have achieved, at a cost, at sacrifice, at struggle. With mistakes? Yes, and with mistakes. But with society on its feet and with the crystal-clear honesty with which we managed the positions of responsibility. And what did those four years, the excellent ones, supposedly? We handed them a public debt of 340 billion euros and it has reached 400 billion euros. They increased the private debt by more than 40 billion euros, they increased the current account deficit tenfold. They spent, they say, over 55 billion to prop up the economy in the time of the pandemic. Watch out: Instead of having the obligation to raise money for the public coffers, they had the discretion to spend.
