We are not the ones who have powerful interests on our side to fund us, we don't have powerful media on our side. But we have on our side all of you, the many and the many, the people of society, the people of creation, the people of work, we will put them in front and with them we will manage to win on May 21 and build a Greece of justice and progress.
