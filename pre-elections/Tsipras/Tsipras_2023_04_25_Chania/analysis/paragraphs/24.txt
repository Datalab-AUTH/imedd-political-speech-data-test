Because if you were to ask me to find a description for Mr Mitsotakis during these four years, I would say exactly that: he doesn't care. He does not care about society, he does not care about the people, he does not care about today and tomorrow and he has been constantly trying to deceive the citizens with communication tricks for four years now, and he has proved it many times. When, during the pandemic, he was asking everyone to take individual responsibility for following the measures he had imposed, he was going on carefree bike rides in Parnitha. Do you remember then? And feasts in Ikaria. When also at every critical moment he invokes ignorance of everything. He knew nothing about the wiretapping going on in the office next door by his nephew. How could he know what his nephew was doing... alas!
