Let me give you two typical examples that show how we understand problem solving and how Mr Mitsotakis, who is also a compatriot of yours and who is supposed to take care of Crete and Chania.
In April '19, under the SYRIZA government, a protocol of cooperation was signed between the Ministry of National Defence and the Municipality of Chania, which provided for the concession of 54 acres of the Markopoulou Camp to the Municipality of Chania. On these 54 acres we had a plan to create, among other things, green spaces and infrastructure for sports, culture and social welfare. The transfer of the military installations to another site was then financed with EUR 1 300 000 and, under the agreement signed, it should have been completed within 15 months.
