But on May 21, what we saw as indignation during the days of Tempi, what we saw as anger overflowing not only among young people, but among all our fellow citizens in the streets, on May 21 this anger, this indignation will be transformed into a political decision and a political mandate with the seal of the popular vote. Greece has a chance to put four hard years behind it. To leave behind this generalised feeling of insecurity, worry, anxiety about tomorrow and to take a first step towards hope, a first step towards certainty, a first step towards the return of justice to the country, and side by side we will fight and I am sure we will win this crucial battle.
