Because what else but a mockery is what we saw yesterday when Mr.Mitsotakis, who has been ruling the country for four years now and has destroyed the National Health System, finished off what was left of the state, shrunk the income, but he comes out - and he hasn't ruled for a single day - and promises better salaries again, an efficient state, and free public health care. It's like the wolf coming out and promising to keep more sheep. That reminds me: the wolf guarding more sheep.
