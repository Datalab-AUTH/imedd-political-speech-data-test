But we communicate with our hearts, with our souls, with our ideas. And so we will communicate until the ballot box, the message of Victory, the message of Change! And I see it in your faces! Change has already come! We are already ahead! Not only in Crete, in all of Greece! So let's go on Sunday to make history. To raise the sun of justice. Change, citizens of Heraklion, is already outside our doors. With our vote, let us open the door to Change, let us open the door to Justice, let us open the door to Democracy.
