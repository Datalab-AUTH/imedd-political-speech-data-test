Do you deserve a Prime Minister who eavesdrops and peers from the Predator keyhole in his office at half the political system? A prime minister who collects material to blackmail half of Greece? We may not agree on much, but there's one thing I'm sure we'll agree on: That this is the most immoral thing any Greek prime minister has ever done in this country. So even if you do not disagree with Mitsotakis' policies, I am sure you disagree with his ethics. So don't give him a blank cheque with your vote so that he can be laundered and spend the next four years doing even worse for democracy. We all have a responsibility with our vote.
