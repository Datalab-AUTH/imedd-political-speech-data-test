So I call on all of you, all democratic citizens of Crete, to declare your support for SYRIZA at the ballot box on Sunday. Declare your decision for a progressive government in the country by voting for SYRIZA on Sunday. Sign the 11 Articles Contract for Change at the ballot box. I call on you, here, from Eleftherias Square, with Justice Street in front of me - the most decisive point to call on you to do this - I call on you to put Crete back in front of this great democratic call. Put SYRIZA first and by far, in all the prefectures of Crete, on Sunday. Let us make it possible for our people to rewrite history on Sunday. To bring democracy to power, to raise the sun of justice over our country once again. To bring justice everywhere, justice for all!
