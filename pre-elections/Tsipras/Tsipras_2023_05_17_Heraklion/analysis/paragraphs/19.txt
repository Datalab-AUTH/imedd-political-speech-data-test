Because, citizens of Heraklion, he cares for a few and powerful. It cares about the army of day labourers who have distributed billions from direct commissions, companies set up a few days before the tenders, the blue children and, as we have aptly named them, the 'blue locusts'. He cares about the big business groups that took the money from the Recovery Fund instead of giving it to infrastructure for the public good, while the small and medium sized businesses, 96% of the businesses in our country, cannot even get past the banks, not to sit at the counter for loans. He cares about these 15 listed companies that have set a 20-year record of profitability, with over 1 billion in profits each in '22. Yes, he cares about them.
