As soon as Androulakis said that he wants to see those who framed him in jail, I said the obvious, that we will conduct a preliminary inquiry to investigate in depth the biggest scandal of the post-revolution, as if he had been electrocuted. And he said yesterday - he did not say, he was crying - that we want to put him in jail. But why is this man so innocent that he did not know, that he did not hear, that he did not see? Is he afraid of justice, which never stops for a moment to say that he trusts it? Why does a man so very innocent behave like a guilty man? But unfortunately, friends, he has done something much worse, which shows his true face.
