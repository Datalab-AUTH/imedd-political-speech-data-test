But I want to say, citizens of Heraklion, the Contract for Change is a realistic and costed proposal, it is feasible and every democratic citizen recognizes what will happen the next day. But it is not only addressed to citizens. It is also addressed to the progressive democratic forces. It is also a call for consultation. To those forces that hopefully understand that it matters and matters who governs the country the next day.
