Forget everything that happened four years ago and everything you've been dragging out. Forget it when you go behind the screen. And give Mr Mitsotakis a chance to move on. To do what to you, that is? Finish you off. Trust the future to the man who burned our present and our past! No, Mr. Mitsotakis. The past four years describe in the darkest colours the four years you are preparing. That is why the Greek people, with their vote, will not let you complete this project! That is why we say that the future of the country is political change. And if tomorrow is a change, it is because your yesterday, Mr Mitsotakis, needed it, as you have done for four years.
