He did not hesitate yesterday to say that the lawsuit filed by the relatives of the victims of the accident in Tempe constitutes an instrumentalisation of this accident. And I wonder: Instrumentalisation by the people who lost their children? We were told today that he did not say that. I want to read to you here, word for word, what he said: "I'm sorry that this issue is being instrumentalized in this way just days before the election. And I believe that the justified anger of the victims' relatives also does not justify this kind of behaviour."
