So yes, our programme will cost them dearly. Because our programme will give workers, the middle class, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs a breathing space, rights. And it will protect public wealth. So our programme that we presented the day before yesterday, the Contract for Change, has 11 articles. But, I am telling you to remember it simply and clearly, so that you can take it to every village in Heraklion and Crete, so that every pensioner knows when he votes for Syriza what will happen. So by voting for SYRIZA, we will have: Wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair, effective, strong welfare state next to the citizen. This is what a vote for SYRIZA means. This is the Contract for Change. Four simple things.
