Crete shows the way. I invite you on Sunday evening to celebrate with the people in this square. Not the vested interests and the day laborers. On election night, let the Cretan lyre play happy songs in this square, with the people, for the people. For the eagles and not for the grasshoppers! Be well! Good strength, good fight, until victory! You have given the message of victory. Our rally today was the best show of victory. We're not going for victory. We're going for victory by a margin! Let's shut down progressive government this Sunday! Goodbye!
