The sad pan-European pandemic, the billions of direct awards, the propaganda of "Information 107" with the Petsas lists, the interceptions and the parastate, the precision that brought households and businesses to their knees, the houses and property marked by the crows, the youth that were so unjustly lost in Tempe two months ago. None of this, I assure you and we pledge, will be forgotten. And none of this will be allowed to happen again.
