But I want to make a special appeal to those who, if they decide to go to the polls en masse, we should send a volunteer help team from today to the Maximus Mansion so that Mr Mitsotakis can pack his things and untangle the Predator cables there. I am addressing the young people and I say to them that if they really want to punish those who have disparaged them, those who have targeted them - even the young people were responsible for the spread of the coronavirus - those who authoritatively beat them up in the squares, those who cut them off in the universities, those who have them, if they work, with unpaid overtime, those who have them living until they are 35 in their parents' house because they cannot raise a family, those who are driving them to emigrate abroad en masse to find a job with dignity, I am therefore addressing these 450.000 young voters and the other 500 000 older voters, up to 30 years old, and I say to them: If you want to punish this regime, there is only one option: Defeat this regime. Otherwise it is not punished. And the defeat of the Mitsotakis regime means a victory for Syriza in Sunday's elections. So here is the most profoundly antisystemic, the most profoundly punitive vote for the coming Sunday! It is the vote for SYRIZA. The vote that will punish the Mitsotakis regime.
