Citizens of Heraklion, I have come to this square many times. But this time, I feel it, you feel it too, the time for change has come! You are signing it today here in Heraklion! Crete is signing it! Crete is signing the Contract of Change with your presence today. Because at every critical turn in history, Crete has always been ahead. And today is such a moment. History calls Crete and Crete calls History! This Sunday, for the second time in 30 years, Crete is again chasing a Mitsotakis from the Maximou Mansion! Citizens of Heraklion, wherever I have been these days, one thing is the feeling of the people: enough is enough! Enough with the arrogance! Enough with obscenity! Enough of this indifference! So much for family rule! Enough of injustice! And today, this is the message you are giving here in Heraklion. Or, to put it another way, as you say it here in Crete, "no more bullying"!
