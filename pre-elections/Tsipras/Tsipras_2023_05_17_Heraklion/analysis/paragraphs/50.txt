Crete has always been a pioneer in the struggle for Change and Democracy. And I know, Crete is with us! SYRIZA will be first in all of Crete. Once again! Next Sunday night, Crete will put on its festive clothes, we will celebrate in this square. But change for Crete means, to say a few words about Crete, upgrading the port of Heraklion, which was left to disintegrate in order to be sold off. It means developing the Nikos Kazantzakis airport, for which nothing has been done in the last four years. It means completing the airport at Kastelli immediately.
