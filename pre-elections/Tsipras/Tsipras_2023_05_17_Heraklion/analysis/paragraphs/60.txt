So I want to ask you in these days, in these hours, to fight this battle together for victory and the great victory! Do not listen to the Cassandras of a power that is panicking. For us the safest criterion is our contact, our interaction with ordinary, everyday people. A safer criterion and a victory performance are gatherings like today's. Compare our rally today with the one that Mr Mitsotakis held in Heraklion and you will understand exactly what will happen next Sunday.
