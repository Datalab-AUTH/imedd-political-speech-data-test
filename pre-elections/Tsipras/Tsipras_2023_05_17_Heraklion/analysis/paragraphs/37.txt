But they say that our programme is expensive. Who says that? Those who have given EUR 10 billion in subsidies in one year to the obscenity of the electricity industry. They say it. It is said by those who gave EUR 10 billion again in one year in direct awards. They are the ones saying this who owe their party EUR 400 million to the banks, borrowed and unpaid, but no one says a word to them and they are preparing to evict ordinary citizens for EUR 5 000 and 10 000.
They know about costing. That is why our programme seemed expensive to them. Well, I want to tell you a truth today: our programme has a cost. It will be expensive. Do you know to whom? To those who are right to be concerned.
