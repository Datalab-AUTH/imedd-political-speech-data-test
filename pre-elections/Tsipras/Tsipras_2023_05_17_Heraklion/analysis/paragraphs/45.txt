The Contract of Change certainly provides for the return of the 13th pension to pensioners. It provides for the reimbursement of the retroactive payments following the decision of the Council of State (CoE), which was taken away by Mr Mitsotakis. 7 billion euros over four years. It provides for the restoration of equality for all pensioners, so that those who have a personal difference can also receive increases - under our law this is the case - from now on, from July. That is what our programme provides for.
