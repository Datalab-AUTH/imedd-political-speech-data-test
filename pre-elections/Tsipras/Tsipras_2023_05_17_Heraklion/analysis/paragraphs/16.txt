But at this point I want to make a parenthesis. I do not often do this, especially when I am in Crete, because I am addressing a minority of Cretans. But we honour them. I will address the conservative people, I will address the voters of New Democracy, those who vote for their own principles and their own values, which we may disagree with, but we respect. Not to those who eat. To those who do not eat. Not everyone eats. Many do eat, it's true, but not all. So I want to address the honest voters of the New Republic and ask them: Is this the New Democracy of your founder, Constantine Karamanlis?
