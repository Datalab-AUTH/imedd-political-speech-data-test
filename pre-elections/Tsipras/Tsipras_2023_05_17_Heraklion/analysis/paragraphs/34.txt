We know and we can protect our cultural heritage, to upgrade our culture. We have the knowledge, the experience, but above all we can. Because we are asking not for a second chance, but for the first chance to govern without memoranda, without the Troika, without coercion. To govern with our will, with our programme and not with our musts! And we have the people to achieve this.
