She went so far as to insult in the most brutal and inhuman way those who have lost their children. And I wonder: How much lower can a prime minister stoop? How much lower can a human being sink? Let's forget about politics here. Because, precisely, this man does not care, does not feel! And it is unfair for Greece and the Greeks to have a prime minister who does not understand, who does not feel the pain, who cannot feel the anguish of the people, who cannot care about ordinary, everyday people, who cannot care about their grief, their anguish.
