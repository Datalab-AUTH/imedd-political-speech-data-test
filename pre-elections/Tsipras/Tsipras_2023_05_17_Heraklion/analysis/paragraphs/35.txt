I want that motto shouted four nights from now. On Sunday coming up, I want you to shout that motto. And we can make it happen! We can achieve the great victory of the people and of democracy and form a progressive government on May 22. Once again Crete will set the tone in this battle. And once again it will be Crete that will drive the Right and a Mitsotakis from the Maximou Mansion! You can be sure of that. It is getting close!
