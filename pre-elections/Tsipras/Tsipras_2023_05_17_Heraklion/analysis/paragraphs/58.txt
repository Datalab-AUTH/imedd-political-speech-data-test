Citizens of Heraklion, this is the proposal of SYRIZA. Democratic understanding, progressive government from the next elections. This is the proposal we put before the Greek people, asking for their mandate. That is why we say that SYRIZA's victory on Sunday will also be a mandate for us. A mandate for the formation of a government and for Change. From this ballot box. There will be no other ballot box. Do not listen to what they say. With a SYRIZA victory there will be no second ballot.
