Our program will cost the funds dearly because they will not take the property of ordinary people, who took the loans at 25% and want to get back 100%. It will cost dearly our program to the energy cartels because it will stop the fairy tale of obscenity, sky-high profits. It will cost dearly to the gas-guzzlers of government contracts and the contractors of direct awards, because it will end on Monday the party they have been throwing for four years.  So it will cost some people dearly. And you know what? They show they're scared, they show they're worried. Remember a few days ago, a video came out. It was a businessman, one of those who our program will cost him dearly, threatening his workers with dismissal if they vote for Syriza, next to the gleeful Minister of Development.
