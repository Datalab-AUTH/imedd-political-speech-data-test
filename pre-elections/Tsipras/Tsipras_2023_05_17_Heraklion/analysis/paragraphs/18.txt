So I was saying that Mr Mitsotakis, I was saying that he doesn't care. But do you want me to tell you something? He doesn't care about many people. There are some he cares about. There are a few that he cares about and he is misunderstood. The houses that are being lost, some people are snatching them up. That's who he cares about. Out of the wages of poverty come the profits of wealth. For those who make it, he cares. From obscenity in electricity, supermarket, fuel, some people stuff bills in tax havens. That's who he cares about. And they, you know what? They didn't work, they worked. Because that was his policy. Right before our eyes he has embarked, with plan and cynicism, on the greatest redistribution of wealth and property since World War II to date. And woe betide him if there is a second four-year term. He is capable of giving even Knossos to the funds and evicting you.
