But it tells us that change means adventures, SYRIZA means adventures, while its regime means stability. Stability in obscenity, stability in injustice, stability in inequality, stability in family rule. Good stability!
But what does he mean by saying that? Especially to young people? Sit on your haunches, that is what he is saying. Do not speak. Don't resist, don't even dream. So I answer this: His own stability is insecurity, worry, anxiety for the many. Because there is no stability anywhere in the world, nor in our country, without justice. There is no stability without democracy. There is no stability without social cohesion. Which is to say, there is no prospect of stability in the country without change. That is why the real dilemma ultimately for the people is: Mitsotakis or stability? And the answer is: SYRIZA on Sunday for a government of progressive cooperation, for a government of stability and longevity.
