And others say they have a two-front. And at the same time, they pretend to be the exclusive spiritual heirs of the legacy of Andreas Papandreou. But if there was one thing that Papandreou left us, it was that he never made a two-front with the right and the progressive forces. He always had one front: The Right. So that is what we are saying today: One is our front, not the other progressive forces. Our front is only the worst right of the post-war period. The right of Kyriakos Mitsotakis. So that is why we are making a proposal for cooperation, we are extending our hands of cooperation to the progressive forces. And above all, we address the sovereign people and say: It matters a great deal who will be first next Sunday.
