Change, my friends, citizens of Heraklion, is not a slogan that we have learned from the past. It is a demand of society, of the everyday man, the man of work, the small and medium-sized businessman, the farmer, the stockbreeder, the young man, every man who wants to live and breathe in this country. Greece will turn the page. And your gathering today confirms it. It is the most reliable poll. Just like the rallies we held in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Volos, Agrinio, all over Greece.
