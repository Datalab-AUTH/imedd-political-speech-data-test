But we have, I was saying, citizens of Heraklion, apart from knowledge, experience and capabilities, we also have people. A comparison of the Syriza and New Democracy state ballots is enough to show who has the comparative advantage in human resources. So we have both the programme and the plan and the people to implement it. A programme costed euro for euro, drawn up through years of dialogue with social groups, confirmed by leading expert technocrats and scientists. With responsibility and determination, we therefore ask the Greek people to give us the mandate to govern. A mandate for change and progressive governance.
