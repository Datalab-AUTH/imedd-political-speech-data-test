Because I have heard some of our comrades on the left say that SYRIZA and New Democracy are the same in their programme. Really, dear comrades? Is it the same if the next day the worker will have a refuge, will he have Collective Labour Agreements, will he have a better wage, will he have a Labour Inspectorate? Is it the same whether overtime will not be unpaid and the eight-hour day will be re-instituted, with the continuation of this government that has ruined everything?
