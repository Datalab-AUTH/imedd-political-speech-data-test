We led Greece out of the memoranda, into the markets. We endowed the stability of the country with 37 billion left in the public coffers, because our hands were honest. People's money that we respected to the last euro. Let us not be lectured on stability by the Party that threw the country into the maelstrom of bankruptcy, left it in 2009 with a 15% deficit and in '15 with empty coffers. It is too much for you to talk to us about stability! And this time, we can say it with certainty: We know how to get the country out of the crisis, we can get the country out of the crisis. We know, we can. That is the assurance we give.
