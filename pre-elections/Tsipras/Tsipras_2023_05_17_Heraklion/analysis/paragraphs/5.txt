And you know what is also very reliable proof of victory, reliable as long as it doesn't get? The fear and panic of Mr. Mitsotakis these days. The fear and panic that he can't hide. And it shows who he is, how he thinks and how he reacts, now that the snakes of defeat have been feeding on him. As soon as he was faced with a bit of a tough question in this debate - which he didn't want the two of us to go to in any way, and it's probably a good thing the man did, but he thought he was going to hide behind the other four - as soon as a tough question was asked, he confessed on his own to the wiretapping scandal.
