It means doubling the funding of the university institutions of Crete and doubling the number of its professors over four years. Because we aim to recruit professors in universities, not police officers. Police officers will go to the neighbourhood to fight crime. Professors in the universities! Student welfare for students. Dormitories. That's our plan.
