It also gives us, what else, the labour jungle of unpaid overtime and the abolition of the eight-hour working day for workers, the constant reduction of the average wage and the purchasing power of households. The day before yesterday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development produced some indicators, irrefutable indicators relating to Greece. Mr Mitsotakis refuted them too. He only agrees with what the 108 briefing, which has recently become 107, only agrees with what is said on the channels. The parrots of the government propaganda. But, however, international organizations and their pointers tell the truth. So what did the OASA tell us the other day? That Greece was the only European country that in the three years 2019 - 2021 had a decrease in nominal wages, in the average nominal wage, and in 2022 had a decrease in the average real wage of 7.5%.
