It is better to say a shot here in the slogans of the young people. Despite Mitsotakis. It is certain, it is certain that Mr Mitsotakis is not going to get the vote of young people with EUR 150, this act of humiliation, this act of disparagement. Yes, better a shot than EUR 150 for a bottle of whisky with Mitsotakis. Because young people's dreams and aspirations for a better life cannot be bought with 150. There is a word you know only in the Greek vocabulary. It does not translate. That word is called philotimo. And when someone underestimates the meaning of this word that is in the Greek consciousness, then they will pay dearly for it. Yes, Mr Mitsotakis will pay dearly for trying to buy off the young people he has targeted, who he has deceived all these four years with EUR 150.
