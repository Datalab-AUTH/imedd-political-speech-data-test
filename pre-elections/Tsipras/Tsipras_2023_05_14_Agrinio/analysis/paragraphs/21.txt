But some people were very worried. And they told us that our program is too expensive. And it doesn't work. Really, is their program of 10 billion in direct awards to day laborers a program that's coming off; their program that in a year and a half gave subsidies to energy companies alone of over 10 billion is a program that's coming off? We can of course answer in another way. Those who left the country bankrupt, with a 15% 100 deficit in 2009 and plunged us into bankruptcy. Those who left the coffers empty in 2015. The ones whose party owes 400 million in loans and unpaid loans to the banks. They want to talk to us about bills, that we took the country out of the memoranda, that we sanitized the public, the public finances, that we left 37 billion in the public coffers. And they have the audacity to talk to us and tell us it's not working?
