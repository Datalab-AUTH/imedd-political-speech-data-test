Our plan is also to support. With money and staff. The agricultural school that we founded. To end, to end the decline, the decline for farmers and ranchers. The decline. And it's not working. Really, their program of 10 billion direct awards to day laborers is a program that's coming out their program that in a year and a half they gave subsidies just to energy companies over 10 billion is a program that's coming out. To reduce the cost of production, the price of fuel. To give subsidies normally and not to cut the power to local land improvement agencies. The farmers and ranchers are the ones who today. They are going through an existential drama and I am well aware of it. I know that farmers. They are killing. They slaughter his female animals. So that they don't judge the herds because they can't, they can't cope with the huge cost of production, the prices of feed. I know that farmers and ranchers have seen power prices go up 15 times. So to these people today we have a commitment to give, we will support them decisively to stay in the countryside, to be able to produce, to be able to cope with the huge cost of production.
