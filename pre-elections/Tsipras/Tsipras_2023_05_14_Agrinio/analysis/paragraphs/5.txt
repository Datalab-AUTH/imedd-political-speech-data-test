What else does it deliver? It delivers us a broken National Health System with a negative record of 37,000 of our fellow human beings who were unjustly lost in the pandemic. A negative record that ranks our country worse than even Bolsonaro's Brazil, in proportion to our population. Why? Why instead of strengthening? Our hospitals with doctors and nurses, instead of building intensive care units, he told us that it is the same for patients whether they are in or out of intensive care units, and I am well aware of the heavy price paid by Agrinio, Aitoloakarnania, here with your hospital being among the worst indicators of the abandonment of indifference by the Mitsotakis government.
