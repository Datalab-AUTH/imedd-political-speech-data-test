We have an obligation to win and we will win because the Greeks do not deserve to spend another four years in injustice, in indifference, in the arrogance of power. And why? To remember a nice old slogan, to remember a nice old slogan, Greece does not belong to a few families that rule us. Greece does not belong to a few rich and powerful people. Greece belongs to all Greeks. You know, these slogans belong to the democratic and progressive party, they are our common heritage. But we do not say them to recapture the glories of the past. We say them because today they have been made dramatically relevant again by the worst right-wing party since the post-war period, the right-wing party of Mr Mitsotakis. Some of the younger people do not remember what the Right means, and Mr Mitsotakis has reminded us of this four years ago with his behaviour and has reminded us that, in the end, the Right means inequality, it means injustice, it means authoritarianism, it means obscenity, it means family rule. All of which we want to put an end to with our vote next Sunday.
