The dilemma then. The dilemma that we have before us at the ballot box. The dilemma we have before the ballot box is indeed whether this change, which is not a change in government, is a change in our lives, in our income, in our rights. So the dilemma we have is one. Mitsotakis again for another four years or change in our lives? Mitsotakis again or justice everywhere? This is the main dilemma next Sunday.
