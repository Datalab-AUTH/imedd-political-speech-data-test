And I want to send this message not only to conservative voters, but I also want this message to reach Mr.Androulakis of Kinal.And let me ask. How will the perpetrators of the parastate really be taken to prison, as he rightly demanded the day before yesterday, with a government of the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis? How can you leave equal distances for the next day between the man who was watching you, because he wanted to control you, on the one hand, and the prospect of a progressive government that will bring about a catharsis and hold the perpetrators of the parastate to account, on the other? So from here, from democratic Agrinio, from democratic Agrinio, from the city of great democratic traditions, I want to remind those who consider themselves to be the exclusive intellectual property of the legacy and the slogans of the democratic party and of the great leader of the democratic party, Andreas Papandreou, of something. And let me remind them that Andreas Papandreou never saw a front, he never had a front in the progressive forces. He had only one front, the Right. The worst Right we have ever had is the one we have today, that's why we. I personally have only one front, Mr Mitsotakis's Right, no one else's. And I extend my hand to all the progressive forces of the country, to the progressive citizens. And I ask them, what is the crucial stakes of this battle? That on May 23rd, Mr. Mitsotakis is not in the Mansion, that we have a progressive coalition government on May 22nd to bring about change.
