But I want us all to close today's meeting by remembering exactly which square we gathered in today. We gathered in Republic Square. But also in the square where, during the difficult years of the occupation, the Nazi occupiers hung three lads on Good Friday and the monument is further down here. And a little further away. In Kalyvia. They executed 200 heroes of our national resistance. This is the history of our land. We don't forget this history. And we will never forget it. Not because we want to take revenge on any people. But because we want humanity to never again experience such atrocities.
