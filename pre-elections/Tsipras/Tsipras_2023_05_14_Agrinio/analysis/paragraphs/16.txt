What exactly do we want to happen next Sunday night? Who will be the ones in the streets celebrating the people's victory? The democratic citizens? Or the cartels and the powerful? Who do we want smiling next Sunday? The energy companies, the cartels of the powerful or do we want the democratic people in the streets hoping for a better tomorrow? I am sure, from your rally today, from your overwhelming presence here in Agrinio today, that next Sunday the people will be celebrating. You will be celebrating, all of us will be celebrating the victory of democracy, the return of justice, the victory of the people. 7 days left for the worst right-wing government the country has ever seen to go. So we will go strong in these 7 days we will go strong to bring victory. And we will win next Sunday. We will win, because we have no choice.
