SYRIZA has put its cards on the table, its programme. We submitted the contract for change, a contract with 11 articles, which is permeated by an inviolable condition, justice. But what is the fourfold? Shall I say I of this contract? Let me say it simply and clearly so that you can convey it during these seven days that have been left in every village, in every citizen, in every caf√©, in every home. What a victory of SYRIZA in the elections and a progressive party and a progressive government means a wage increase, a price reduction, a regulation of debts and a fair, efficient, strong social state next to the citizen. This means.
