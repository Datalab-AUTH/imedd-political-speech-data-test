And we begin the hard work, the hard work of bringing change and justice into people's lives. Because Greece and the Greeks do not deserve 4 years of arrogance, but 4 years of indifference, 4 years of extreme corruption, 4 years of family rule, 4 years of obscenity, 4 years of generalized injustice. And this citizens of Agrinio are becoming every day conscious of the majority of our people, who no longer want to live under siege by worry, insecurity and anxiety. And now there is no longer any doubt about who cares and who is indifferent about who works for the public interest and who works for the interests of the powerful.
