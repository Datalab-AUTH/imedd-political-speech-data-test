So today I want to address not you, but the conservative citizens, the honest New Democrats. We have important ideological differences, but I believe that a very large part of these conservative citizens are honest and feel ashamed of this family that governs them, that governs us and that governs their party. They are ashamed of the wiretapping scandal, of the violation of the rule of law, of the rape of democracy, of the widening of inequalities. I don't want to ask them. Mr Mitsotakis, it is clear, wants to be washed away with your vote. Will you wash him out with your vote; will you be complicit in the rape of democracy? Will you give him a blank cheque to carry on doing the same and worse, to become possibly even more dangerous? It is obvious that there will be no light and no catharsis if Mr Mitsotakis does not pay the price for his actions, that is, if he is not defeated in the elections of 21 May. We therefore call on the citizens not to be complicit in this crime.
