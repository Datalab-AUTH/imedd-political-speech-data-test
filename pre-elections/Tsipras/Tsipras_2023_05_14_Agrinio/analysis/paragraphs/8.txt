What does this mean, citizens of Agrinio? It means that where we were promised better jobs and better wages and support for the middle class, the middle class has been reduced to living on vouchers, needing vouchers to go to the supermarket, to pay for electricity, to put petrol in petrol stations. But what else were we being told, remember 19? They promised better days to the defenders of work, to the pensioners. And what happened to all those years? According to what Eurostat says, pensioners with pensions of up to â‚¬700 a month have seen their purchasing power fall by 40%. The pension they were receiving in 19 is 40% less in terms of its purchasing value. The pensioner today does not have the dignity of being able to give a gift to his grandchild. And what else have those who have the audacity to wag their finger at us done to pensioners? When they told us that we supposedly betrayed Macedonia in order to save pensions, when they told us these miserable things, those who now went hand in hand and honoured the agreement that we made while serving our patriotic duty. So those who then told us that the 13th pension was a pittance, abolished the 13th pension and even took away retroactive payments from pensioners, despite the decision of the Council of State. 7 billion in total was taken away from pensioners in this four-year period.
