But I want to tell you one more thing. I told you earlier that Mr Mitsotakis does not care. That is half the truth. He does not care about the many, he cares about a few and powerful, he cares about a privileged few. It is no accident. Very few days ago a video saw the light of day on the Internet. With an employer next to the Minister of Development, where he was gleefully threatening and blackmailing workers that if they don't vote for New Democracy and vote for Syriza, they will be fired. This man has a point, because if SYRIZA becomes the first party next Sunday and we have a government of progressive cooperation, the easy money from the public purse that he has been receiving all this time will be cut off. It is a waste of billions. Sky-high profits privatizing the PPC, hospitals, water. Distribution of Recovery Fund resources to big conglomerates, blue grasshoppers, so called the party cadres' assault on public money and public positions. These are Mr Mitsotakis's projects. How can he not care? He cares, but he cares for the few and the privileged. 15 listed companies with more than a billion in profits each, a twenty-year record of profitability, are Mr Mitsotakis' work, and that too at a time when households cannot make it through the third week of the month. So how can he not care? He cares, but for some powerful people and they in turn care in order to gain another four years which will translate into profit for themselves. They support him because he has the state coffers, they vote for him, they fund him, they craft his image in the media, so it's pretty simple.
