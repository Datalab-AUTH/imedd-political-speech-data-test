That is why, as the late Manolis Glezos used to say, even if war reparations were â‚¬1, we must claim this euro. However, the day before yesterday, Mr Mitsotakis, through Mr Skertzos, told us to forget about German reparations and the occupation loan once and for all. So I want us to answer that from this square. From here, which was a heroic place, like almost every other place in our country, where there were executions, hardships, torture and murders.
