So we will not forget everything that has happened in this four-year period. Nor will we forget the crime of Tempe. Nor will we forget the rape of democracy and the rule of law through illegal surveillance. Mitsotakis was avoiding. Like the devil on incense to come to a debate. And he probably knew something that he was avoiding. He still avoids the invitation to come and debate today, but he decided and accepted the 6 political leaders meeting, thinking he would be able to hide behind the other 4. But at the first zorik question, he was stunned and he testified without a beating, his monk, everything he had been trying to keep hidden for 9 months now. In connection with the great wiretapping scandal. He confessed to the scandal and the rape of democracy and the rule of law. He admitted that there was no national reason for the wiretapping. But I want to ask myself once again here from Agrinio. If there was no national reason for the interceptions, then why did he invoke national secrecy for nine months to conceal the truth from the parliamentary committee of inquiry? Why, if there was no national reason, did the prosecutor of the NSA, Mrs Vlachou, illegally sign the provisions for the surveillance of citizens? Half the political system, political leaders, ministers, even the heads of the armed forces. And why is this lady still in her position? Where does she keep Mr Mitsotakis? Why, too, and what exactly did the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Mr Doyakos, do to identify the perpetrators? And why why why? There is no indictment 9 months today for these illegal acts. So, to conclude, it is not only a scandal, it is a crime against democracy, against the rule of law, against the rights of the citizen and it is also a felony under the criminal code. A felony that they are trying to cover up by manipulating the judiciary and now they are attempting to wash away their blunders with the vote of the people.
