It has been proven for four years now that Mr Mitsotakis does not care about the many but only about the few and the powerful. 8 years ago they handed over to SYRIZA an economy in tatters, a society on its knees, a country devastated, plunged into bankruptcy, with troikas and overseers and they received, after hard work, a country out of the memoranda, in the markets with 12 quarters of growth, with the public debt regulated and with 37 billion in the public coffers. Why? So that Mr Mitsotakis can finally eat from the ready-made, so that he can squander what we have achieved with enormous sacrifices and difficulties on direct assignments to day labourers and subsidies for the obscenity of the powerful.
