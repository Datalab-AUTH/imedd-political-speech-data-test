Citizens of Agrinio, at this point I would like to say a few words about what justice means for your place, justice for your prefecture. By upgrading the NHS and its people so that your two hospitals are not destroyed, doctors do not resign, outpatient clinics and surgeries are not cut, we believe that we can create conditions of justice and this is the framework in our programme.
