Friends and friends citizens of Agrinio. This is the image of indifference and arrogance that the Mitsotakis government and Mr Mitsotakis himself have shown throughout the four years. He knew nothing and everything was someone else's fault. He knew nothing himself. He needs more proof. To realize that we can't go on with this understatement any longer. Citizens of Agrinio, citizens of Aitoloakarnania, next Sunday we have a chance. We have the opportunity at the ballot box. We have the opportunity to punish those who, for four years now, with their arrogance and indifference, have led us into a painful situation, but we also have the opportunity to pave the way for a progressive government, a government of progressive cooperation, not only to punish, but to take responsibility to put society back on its feet, to reinvigorate the economy, to change this framework of inequalities and to breathe life into the dreams of the new generation, the hopes of the great majority of society.
