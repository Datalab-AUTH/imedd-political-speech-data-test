Citizens of Agrinio. Today, with your gathering today, Aitoloakarnania gives a definitive answer. On 21 May the people will win, on 21 May democracy will win. Whoever. Anyone who had doubts about what is the real victory performance in the coming elections, has only to see what is happening here today, in Democracy Square, in the heart of Agrinio. Today, from here in Agrinio, with your magnificent gathering today, we begin the seven-day battle for the final victory, for the great victory of our people on May 21. From Democracy Square, here in Agrinio, democracy is fighting back, to bring down the vicious regime that governs us, to get rid of the worst right-wing government since the post-communist period, to put society back on its feet, to bring back democracy in power and justice everywhere, in society and in our country. And the message that you are sending today, the message that Agrinio is sending today is one: Mr Mitsotakis, next Sunday you are finally leaving the Maximou building. Next Sunday, change is coming. Next Sunday, with the victory of our people on 21, we win and on 22 we form a government of progressive cooperation.
