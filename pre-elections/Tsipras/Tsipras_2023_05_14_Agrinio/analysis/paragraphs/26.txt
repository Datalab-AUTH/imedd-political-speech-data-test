But I want to tell you. In addition to the 11 articles, we already have the first legislative act ready. Because justice must be speeded up. And the legislative act that we have ready to sign before the Parliament is even constituted has 3 articles. Its first article says suspension of the auctions of first homes. Until the law that definitively regulates and protects the first home is passed, which has the signature of the politician who linked her name to the protection of the first home, Lucas Katseli.
