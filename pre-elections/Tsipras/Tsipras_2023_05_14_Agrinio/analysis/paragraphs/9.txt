What else? Mr Mitsotakis is handing us a booty state with the blue grasshoppers occupying positions in all the public utilities and giving themselves bonuses with appointments outside the AESEP, with a doubling of the number of temporary employees and with complete disregard and indifference even for the security of the citizen. With the most indisputable proof of this being Tempe, an unspeakable tragedy. The result of the political immorality of a regime that let the railways fall apart. And a few days before the accident, it had no shame. The minister in charge shouting shame in parliament when SYRIZA MPs told him that he had left the railways in tatters and that there were risks to passenger safety. And today, today, this minister, the minister of Tempi, is again a candidate of Mr Mitsotakis' choice, to be washed up in the pool of Siloam. But Mr Mitsotakis told us at the time. That it was a human error that the stationmaster was to blame for all this. Who really appointed this stationmaster with a party buffet? Unqualified, unqualified, unqualified, untrained? Who appointed him? And afterwards made him permanent.
