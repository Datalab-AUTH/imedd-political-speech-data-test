Well, I want to make it clear once again. We will implement our programme to the hilt and we will implement it to the hilt, because it is a disgrace that those who have wasted 60 billion over the last three years, thanks to the pandemic, have left nothing of substance for society. Leaving the public hospitals, the welfare state in tatters. Leaving small and medium-sized businesses at the mercy, they have no right to talk to us when we say that we will give a â‚¬2,000 salary to the first doctor appointed to rebuild the hospitals so that citizens can have decent care.
