He asked me. The day before yesterday a new kid. How do you see things? I said how do you see things? I see a SYRIZA victory, he replied. I said why? Can't you see that they keep presenting polls that say the opposite? He replied, I see a SYRIZA victory because I and all my friends will vote for SYRIZA. Secondly, I see a SYRIZA victory because there is no other way. Because it is our only hope to stay in this country, not to emigrate, not to go abroad. And I take this answer not only as a message of optimism, but also as a heavy responsibility. We have a heavy responsibility to turn the dreams of these young people, the aspirations of these young people, into reality. We have a heavy responsibility. We are obliged not only to win, but also to rebuild our country on solid foundations of social justice, to give perspective to the dreams of the new generation.
