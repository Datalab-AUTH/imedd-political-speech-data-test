But why do I say this and remind you of it? Because ten days ago, after Tempe, they did something worse to prove that they perceive the state as their own property. They made an appointment outside the CSE, to the OSE! The offspring of the chief trade unionists of the DAKE; that is their perception of the State. They believe that the state belongs to them. We are the only ones who can change this state because we believe that the state belongs to the people and should serve the people and not the selfish interests of a party nomenklatura, which will govern at any given time.
