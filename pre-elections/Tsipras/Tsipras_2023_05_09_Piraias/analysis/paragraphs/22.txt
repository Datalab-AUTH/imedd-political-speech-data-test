I want to tell you, dear friends, citizens of Piraeus, that we are entering this final straight, this difficult and decisive battle and I want us to enter this battle with the awareness that this battle will be won by no one else but you. All of you; all of you who believe that we can build a better tomorrow for our country. All of you, who wish to end this widespread injustice, to bring back justice and prosperity. To bring about change. And we know and we can bring change; we are told by some that "you are asking for a second chance." We answer them: we ask for THE chance to govern on our program. Because for 4.5 years we have governed by coercion, not by our programme. That is why we say that yes, we know because we have learned from our mistakes. And we can, because now we will not govern together with the Troika, we will not govern with memoranda, but we will govern together with the Greek people to protect their interests, to put their "will" into practice.The dilemma of the ballot box is obvious. The dilemma of the ballot is: do we change or do we continue to sink?
