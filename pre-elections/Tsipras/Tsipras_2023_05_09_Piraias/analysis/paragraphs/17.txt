Unfortunately, however, we have reached a tragic development, which has highlighted this crime against the state: the tragic accident at Tempe with the 57 dead. The tragic tragedy of the tragic accident at Tembi, which led to the tragic tragedy of the Tembes accident, which was caused by the tragedy of the tragedy of the Tembes tragedy, which resulted in the tragic tragedy of the tragedy of the Tembes. A man untrained, unskilled and with no previous experience; they told a pack of lies. They said that it was supposedly the fault of the government that was four years ago, they said that supposedly those antiquated consoles in Larissa were telecommand, while the telecommand burned down in 2019 after the elections and none of them rushed to replace it.They told a bunch of lies to escape responsibility. Because a key characteristic of Mitsotakis, apart from not caring, is that he is also the Prime Minister of no responsibility. There were 10 million individual responsibilities in the pandemic, only the responsibility of the Prime Minister was missing. He attempted to do exactly the same in the tragic case of Tempe.
