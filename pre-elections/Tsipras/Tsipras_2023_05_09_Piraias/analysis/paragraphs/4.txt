I want to say a few words from the heart to the citizens of Piraeus today about how I perceive this critical electoral situation, about this critical electoral battle, about the struggle we are waging, about the effort we are making to change things.Because for four years now - I heard a word here: "calamity" - the government of Mr Mitsotakis has failed in all the critical issues it came to face. It has failed in the pandemic with a heavy toll of blood. 37,000 of our fellow citizens lost their lives, the National Health System was shattered, we have the worst rates in the whole of Europe in terms of human losses in proportion to our population.
