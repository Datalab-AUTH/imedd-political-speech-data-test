The third article of the legislative act that we are ready to table before we even take office is the abolition of the minimum entrance requirement to universities, to higher education, for children who are taking national examinations at this time, because we don't want our children to become a reservoir for the college masters to have a clientele. We want children who can have the opportunity to study in good public universities. 60,000 kids were cut in those three years. This bleeding will stop here.
