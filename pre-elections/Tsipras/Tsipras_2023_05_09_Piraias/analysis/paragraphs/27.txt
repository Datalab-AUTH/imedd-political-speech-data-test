We want you to bear in mind, friends, that our plan is both realistic and costed. It is a plan that can be put into practice and bring significant changes in people's lives and in their daily lives.Address yourselves with determination, not only to progressive and democratic citizens, because I think that even conservative citizens cannot tolerate this situation. And it is not a question of whether one is right-wing, left-wing or centrist when they threaten to take away one's home, one's life, one's property. It is not a question of whether you are right, left or centre when you cannot leave your house for the third week because your income is being saved.This time we want to address all Greeks and all Greeks and tell them that we know that we can make the change they dream of, the change we all need. To move forward with unity, with dignity, with pride, to rebuild our homeland, a homeland of justice and prosperity.
