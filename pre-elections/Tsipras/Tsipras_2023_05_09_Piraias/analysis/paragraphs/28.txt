So, and I close with this, the dilemma of the ballot box is ultimately one: Mitsotakis again or Change? Mitsotakis again or Syriza-Progressive Alliance? I am sure that your answer, and that of the majority at the ballot box, will be SYRIZA first, a victory for SYRIZA, a victory for Democracy, a victory for our people, a victory for our people to bring justice back to this country, and a victory for SYRIZA in Piraeus! Our goal is obviously to be first in Piraeus to give the message of change from the ballot box of the simple proportional representation. Good strength and good races. On the evening of May 21, may our people celebrate, not the cartels, not the powerful, not the interests. May the democratic people of Piraeus, the democratic people all over Greece celebrate.Good strength and victory.Goodbye.
