And I want to address Mr.Androulakis who insists on an untruthful two-front, at the same time as he tells us that he is the exclusive owner and heir of Andreas Papandreou's legacy. But Papandreou never had a two-front, he had one front: the Right. So we have one front, the worst right-wing government since the post-war period, the government of Mr Mitsotakis.We call on progressive citizens to consider how crucial this contest is and how important it is for SYRIZA to win the first place, despite the fact that we have a simple proportional representation. Because this is the only way to turn the page and move forward to the prospect of a government of progressive cooperation that will bring change in our lives.
