I want to tell you with great sincerity that I am very, very proud, very happy, I feel very honoured that I am going to fight this great battle for the first time as a candidate here in the Piraeus region.Piraeus is the city of great social struggles, Piraeus is the great working city, the first port of our country. It was in this place, in this city, that the 1st Panhellenic Labour Congress, the 1918 Congress of the GSEE, was completed in your Municipal Theatre. Here the Socialist Workers' Party was founded, here great struggles of our people took place with the working class in the front line, but also with the outward-looking small and medium-sized entrepreneurship. Here, during the difficult years of the occupation, the people of Piraeus fought on the front line for the freedom and prosperity of our people.This is where steel was bound, because they say that Piraeus is - and indeed it is - the city of the miracle of shipping, but this miracle happened because some people bound steel in the machine shops and in the shipyards, the workers, the people of toil, the people of creation.
