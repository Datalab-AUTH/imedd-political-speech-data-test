Our programme is an 11-point programme, but I want you to keep in mind four main points. By voting for SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance you are voting for a wage increase, price reduction, debt regulation and for a fair and effective state next to the citizen.But let me say a few words about this fair and effective state next to the citizen. Let me say a few words because I think the worst thing that has happened over the years is that the National Health System has been discredited, our universities and our schools have been discredited and I think that an even worse thing that has happened is that we are back to the days of the booty state, the blue state.They have taken over this state as blue locusts. They doubled the temporary employees, put their own people in all the PPOs, doubled the salaries, gave themselves bonuses of millions. They went so far as to take advantage of the pandemic condition to give over 10 billion euros in direct contracts and closed tenders to companies they were building three days before the tender.
