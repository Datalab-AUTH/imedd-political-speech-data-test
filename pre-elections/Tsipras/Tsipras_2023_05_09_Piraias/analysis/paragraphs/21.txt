We, on the other hand, I want to be honest: our programme has a cost, yes, it has a cost. It's going to cost a lot to the funds that will not be able to speculate by auctioning off the houses of the middle class, of the weak people.Yes, our program is going to cost a lot to the energy companies that have made over 6 billion in excess profits, and this party will be cut, it will be stopped. Yes, our programme will cost those employers who are picking up workers next to ministers and threatening them that if they don't vote for New Democracy they will lose the direct awards, which were over 10 billion. Yes, it will cost some people our programme if it is implemented and it will be implemented with the support of the Greek people.
