In addition to the 11-point programme, you should know that we have also prepared a legislative act. When? To be tabled on the first day, before the House of Assembly even opens for the formation of the progressive government, and this legislative act has three things:The first is what I just told you, which is that all auctions of first homes in the country will be cancelled, suspended until the plan that we presented a few days ago, which has the signature of a politician who identified her name with the protection of first homes during the difficult years of the memorandum, Lucas Katseli, is institutionalized, legislated.Therefore, the legislative act will have as its first article and we will never again see images like the one we saw the day before yesterday of the disabled 80-year-old man in Halkidiki who was evicted from his house because he was a loan guarantor for his unemployed son. We will not see such images of callousness again with a progressive government.
