In the last few days, however, Mr Mitsotakis is either indulging in a black propaganda that seems to be addressed to the ignorant, to people without memory, he wants to convince us that if SYRIZA comes, we will see tragic misfortunes coming to the country.SYRIZA, which took the country out of the Memoranda, SYRIZA, which managed to keep the country in the markets, SYRIZA, which managed to leave 37 billion in the public coffers, according to Mr Mitsotakis. Is the Greek people forgetting who the party was, the party that bankrupted the economy and the country twice, once in 2009, leaving a 15% deficit, and once in 2015, when they left us with empty coffers and ruined public finances?We will not follow this black propaganda?We will not follow this black propaganda. We will not follow this logic, the logic that on the one hand considers people dumb, on the other hand despises them and gives young people 150 â‚¬ to go and vote for him.The 18-year-olds have made their decisions and as long as he does this, worse they will react against the logic of contempt!I said this yesterday for the shot, don't make me repeat it. It was good!
