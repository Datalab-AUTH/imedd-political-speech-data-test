But I want to say one more thing here, because it is not only black propaganda that really trivialises political dialogue. It is also the effort that they are trying to make these days to convince the Greek people that Syriza's programme supposedly costs... how much did they say? At first they cost 24 billion, then they said it was 45 billion, then they went on to say 80 billion. By the time of the elections they could reach 180 billion, you can be sure of that.But I want to ask how much does the programme that Mr Mitsotakis has been implementing for four years really cost? How much does the dismantling of the National Health System cost in human lives? How much does the devaluation of the National Socialist System cost in human lives? How much is the shrinking of labour rights costing lives? How much does the devaluation of young people, who cannot dream in this country and leave as immigrants abroad, cost?
