Because for us, the simple proportional representation is not an electoral system, which we introduced, we introduced it only to have equality of votes, of course, and that's why. But we introduced it so that everyone can take responsibility for how the country will be governed the next day.Mr Mitsotakis says that he will not use simple proportional representation, and I personally do not believe that. If he comes even half a point ahead in this electoral battle, he is bound to try to form a government by any means, whether by pressure, blackmail or defections, as this family is well known to do. The only way to thwart this plan is to vote for Syriza. SYRIZA first and the way will be opened for the government of progressive cooperation.
