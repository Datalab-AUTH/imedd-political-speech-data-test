But yesterday a decision of the European Parliament came out, a decision that is a hell of a decision for the country and for Mr Mitsotakis. Because the European Parliament decided by a huge majority that Greece is unfortunately moving away from Europe, from the rule of law in Europe. Mitsotakis is a leader synonymous, identical to Orban of Hungary, a leader who has discredited the rule of law in Greece, and he is making recommendations to the European Parliament to restore legitimacy, democracy, the rule of law, to give breath to the independent authorities and to stop the NSA from monitoring citizens and especially the political opponents of the Prime Minister.This infernal decision is a decision that will accompany Mr Mitsotakis forever.
