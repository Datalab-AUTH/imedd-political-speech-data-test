This government that deceived and targeted and made the vast majority of households in the third week unable to pay their bills and go out of the house because income is being saved, has defiantly favoured a few and powerful people.Because at the same time that there is no income, 15 major companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange are seeing record profitability over the last 20 years with over 1 billion in profits each. This is what we are saying that our life has become unfair and this injustice must be put to an end.We cannot have the powerful becoming more powerful, the middle class becoming poor and the poor becoming poorer. Because that is what has happened over these four years.
