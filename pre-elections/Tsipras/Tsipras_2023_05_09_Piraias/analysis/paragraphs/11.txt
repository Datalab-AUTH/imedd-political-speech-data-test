And I ask myself today: if after all they have done for four years they are given the opportunity to govern again, how exactly will they behave? What worse will they do to this country?That is why, friends, that is why, citizens of Piraeus, the elections of May 21 are not elections of loose votes, they are elections that will decide the next four years of our lives. They are elections that will either give a prospect of hope, a way out, a breath of life, or in the name of a loose vote will enable those who have committed crimes against democracy itself to continue to commit crimes.
