Citizens of Piraeus, thank you very much for this overwhelming welcome. A very big thank you from the bottom of my heart for this love, for this strength that you give me, for this strength that you give us. Because wherever we meet and wherever we stand these days, a great feeling comes out of ordinary everyday people: That's enough! Enough is enough...!Enough is enough with the deception. Enough of the targeting. Enough with the indifference. Enough of arrogance. Enough with the familialism. Enough of obscenity. The time has come for the Greek people to vote to put an end to this four-year period of deception, indifference, arrogance and targeting of ordinary, everyday people.
