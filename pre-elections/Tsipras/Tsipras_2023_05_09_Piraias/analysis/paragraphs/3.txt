That is why it is a great honour for me to fight this battle with you. Piraeus has always been at the forefront of the struggles, at the forefront of the struggles for justice and for the change that the country needs so much.And we will give the message of victory from our rally today and through our efforts until the polls to be the first party in Piraeus and in all of Greece, because this will pave the way for the formation of a progressive government next election.
