It has failed miserably to tackle the energy crisis. We are the country with the most expensive electricity price in Europe, we are the country with the most expensive petrol price in Europe. It has failed to tackle the inflationary crisis; for the second year, supermarket prices are prohibitive; food inflation is at 14%; it has widened inequalities, it has targeted working people by abolishing institutions that have always been in line with working people and labourers. It allowed unpaid overtime, it abolished the 8-hour day in practice.It targeted young people, at first by saying that they were responsible for the spread of the coronavirus, by putting barriers to their access to higher education in universities with the minimum entry basis, by putting obstacles to work with the flexibilisation of work, by making it impossible for them to fulfil their dreams in this country.
