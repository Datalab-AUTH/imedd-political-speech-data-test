But I also want to address the other progressive forces, mainly PASOK and the KKE. I want to address them, because I understand that these are days of competition, but it is not possible to choose an unhistorical tactic of two-faced equation; it is not possible to repeat the mistakes of the past, which have cost the country, society and the popular movement so much, of the logic of "what is Plastira, what is Papagos". And if anyone can save the people, it is unity. The unity of the progressive democratic forces.
