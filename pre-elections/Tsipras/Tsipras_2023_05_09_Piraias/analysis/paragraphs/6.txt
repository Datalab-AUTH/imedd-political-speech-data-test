This government has deceived and targeted the vast majority of the Greek people. It deceived the middle class, remember what Mr Mitsotakis said in 2019 when he was running for Prime Minister? That he would support the middle class. And today it is the middle class that needs vouchers to survive. Vouchers to go to the supermarket, vouchers to go to the petrol station to fill up with petrol, vouchers to pay for electricity. Our whole life has become a pass.Pass-everywhere, but nowhere to go!And it's time to give Mitsotakis a pass.It's time to go home!
