Citizens of Piraeus, I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the Greek people do not want this situation that has prevailed for these four years to continue. I am sure that many people want change, they want a change above all in their lives and in the government, but also in their lives, a breath of fresh air, a perspective, and there is only one way to make this change happen: by voting on May 21 with SYRIZA as the first party in the elections, which will pave the way for the formation of a progressive government.A few days ago we published what we called "Contract for Change", 11 articles that concern our lives above all else, concern the future of the country and are at the same time a proposal to all democratic, progressive citizens to know on the 21st of May when they vote for SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance what they are voting for. But it is also a proposal to all the progressive forces of the country to consider that despite the differences we have, we really do have, the crucial thing is whether this government, this government that has shrunk the rights of the vast majority of the social majority, that has destroyed the rule of law, that has created conditions of terrible inequalities, will continue to govern with our tolerance, our inability to find a framework of understanding, will continue to govern with our tolerance, our inability to find a framework of understanding.
