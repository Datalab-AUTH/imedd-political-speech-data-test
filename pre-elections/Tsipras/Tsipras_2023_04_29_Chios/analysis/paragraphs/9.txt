And what are my friends preparing to happen in the next few months for the middle class? What are they preparing to happen to the middle class next? What's coming is a great tsunami of foreclosures. First home foreclosures. 4,200,000 Greeks. Almost half of the Greeks, half of Greece, have debts, red debts, bad debts to banks, to funds, to social security funds and to the tax authorities. Half of Greece is in debt. Mr Mitsotakis received the public debt at 356 billion from the Syriza government, took it up to 400 billion, raised it to 50 billion, and the private debt? He raised it by 40 billion. And the current account balance, i.e. exports, imports, the deficit increased tenfold. This is not the picture they want to give us of the economy that they present too many times in the media. The critical thing is the picture of the real economy. what does that mean? The picture of our pocketbooks. You know it, you are experiencing it, we are all, most of us, a large majority, going through great economic hardship. So the question is how to give perspective, breath, support to the real economy, to people, to society; that is the big issue.
