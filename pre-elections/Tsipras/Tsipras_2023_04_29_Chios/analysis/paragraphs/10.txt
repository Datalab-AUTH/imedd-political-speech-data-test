And the question is: is there a perspective; is there a possibility; is there a plan? Is there a solution? We say yes, there is, with a government that is concerned about the ordinary everyday citizen and not the cartels, not the big interests, not the few and powerful. So this government will fall. A few days left. We will have a great victory of the people and they will be rubbing their eyes on the night of May 21.
