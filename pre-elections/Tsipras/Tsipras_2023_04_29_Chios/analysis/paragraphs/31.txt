I want to close by saying a few words about Chios. I would like to say a few words about Chios as well. I said before that it is... Chios has injustice within injustice, right? and the North Aegean. In a country that is unjust in the whole of Europe, your region is the most unjust in the Greek territory. It has the lowest per capita income of the 13 regions. But I want to say that we can do things that are important for your country. You will also remember that it was we who decided on something that had been stagnating for many years. The airport. The airport that became human. That became an important hub for tourism and for the development of the island.
