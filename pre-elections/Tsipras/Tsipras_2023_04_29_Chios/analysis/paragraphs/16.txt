I am on an island where I know very well that you experience injustice not only within the social fabric, but also in relation to your geographical location. Geographical inequalities within social inequalities and geographical inequalities are a very important issue and I was reading the data, the official ELSTAT data, which said that the North Aegean region, where your island belongs, is 13th out of 13 regions in terms of per capita income. You have the lowest per capita income. Greece has the lowest, together with Bulgaria and rivaling Romania, per capita income in terms of purchasing power in the whole European Union. So what exactly happened during these years, the memorandum years? Greece, which was at 77% of the eurozone average, has gone from under 60 to 59%. A number of countries have passed us by, we are competing with the countries of Eastern Europe in terms of per capita income, that is, in terms of wages, the income of citizens, their purchasing power. That is why it is not the same to have precision in Greece with low wages, with low incomes, and to have the same prices in the supermarket as a citizen in France, as a citizen in Germany, because there the wage can be afforded. Here the wage cannot be affordable.
