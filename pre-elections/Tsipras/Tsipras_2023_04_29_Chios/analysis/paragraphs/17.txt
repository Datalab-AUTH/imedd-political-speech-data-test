So if we have to have a national goal in the next few years, that national goal should be, not to stay in Europe. We solved that when some people wanted to kick us out, like Sch√§uble. Now our goal must be to become Europe. In the next few years Greece should become a normal European country again, and a normal European country means wages, income, affordable prices, a welfare state, a national health system. It means a country where the state respects the citizen; where the citizen does not see the state and understands that it is something hostile, which means that the state must stop being this party fiefdom, this anachronistic state.
