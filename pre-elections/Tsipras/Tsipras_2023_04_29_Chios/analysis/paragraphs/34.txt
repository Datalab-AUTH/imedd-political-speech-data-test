A second big vision next to the transport equivalent is the health equivalent. To create the conditions where the state will stand by the islander and the health care and health needs of the island. A citizen living on an island, especially nowadays, with the development of technology, with the development of transport possibilities, cannot feel like a second-class citizen. The state must therefore provide those possibilities of support, both financial support and health structures, of covering the needs for transport to hospitals, to the nearest hospitals, if necessary, to all citizens who live on the islands. This is the second great vision, being the health equivalent next to the transport equivalent.
