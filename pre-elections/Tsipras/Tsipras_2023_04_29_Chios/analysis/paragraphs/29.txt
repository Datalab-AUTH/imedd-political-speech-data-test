Debt settlement. With the plan that we presented and has the signature of a politician who was identified with the protection of the first home in all the difficult years of the memoranda, Lucas Katseli. A plan that aims to make the regulations compulsory, to put operating rules on the funds and to move towards viable regulations. Because our aim now is not just to protect the weak, but also the middle classes, those who, with viable regulations, can save their homes, their business premises, their farmland, the middle class, in other words. And of course a fair, effective welfare state.
