Elections with proportional representation are not elections with a loose vote. Simple proportional representation elections were our vision to have fairness in voting as well. Whatever the citizen votes for should be reflected in Parliament. We were told by some that they had self-reliant governments, but minority governments. No government had more than 50%, they were all minority governments. They called them self-reliant. Many of them were also very arrogant and led us into bankruptcy. So now we have the opportunity for this great change in the way we govern. But be careful. Simple proportional representation and parity of vote does not mean a loose vote because this election will produce a government. Remember that. So let's keep that in mind. A loose vote means Mitsotakis. It means obscenity means injustice, it means perpetuating the great inequalities of this drama that we have lived through for four years. So we have to keep in mind, especially young people, young children, 17 to 22, 17 to 21. Those who did not vote in the last election are over 450,000. Keep in mind that the strongest protest vote is the one that will hurt the system, it is the one that will hurt the establishment. It is the vote that will make the Mitsotakis regime defeated. And things are simple. The defeat of Mitsotakis and New Democracy means the victory of Syriza.
