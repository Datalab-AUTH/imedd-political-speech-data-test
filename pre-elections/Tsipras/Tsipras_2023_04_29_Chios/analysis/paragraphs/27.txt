Restoration of the thirteenth pension that Mr Mitsotakis abolished, saying it was peanuts. He has not given it for four years, at a cost of 4.5 billion to pensioners. Payment of retroactive payments to all beneficiaries. The retroactive payments that were taken away, decided by the Council of State for Samaras' illegal cuts in pensions and supplementary pensions, two and a half billion was not given by Mitsotakis. Two and a half and four and a half, 7 billion he took away from pensioners and from 1 July he also distributed to those who have a personal difference of increases, 7.5 %. These are our commitments for increases in citizens' income.
