And since I see young people here, I want to say a few words about the targeting of the younger generation by the Mitsotakis government. You will remember during the pandemic period, in this country they had an individual responsibility. We had 10 million individual responsibilities, only he himself was not responsible; he was putting tough measures in place, he even wagged his finger at us and violated them himself. With bicycle rides, motocross, parties in Ikaria. But watch out especially for young people, he targeted them. He gave the impression, he wanted to spread the opinion that young people are irresponsible and they are responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. He is not responsible for the very negative results. You know, we were the worst of the worst in the whole western world in terms of deaths per million population. We even surpassed Bolsonaro's Brazil, why? Because our public hospitals are in this state of disrepair. And what was he saying then? That he didn't know that there was a study by Mr. Ciodra that said that anyone who is intubated outside the intensive care unit - the intensive care units has no hope of survival. And he was saying to the Greek people, you prove it to me. Unfortunately, 36 thousand deaths proved it. This heavy loss for our fellow citizens, but I come to the young people now again.
