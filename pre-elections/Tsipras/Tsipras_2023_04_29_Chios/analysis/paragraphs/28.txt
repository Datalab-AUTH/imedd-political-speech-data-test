The reduction and price containment can be achieved by immediately reducing VAT to 6% for food products, even to zero VAT we can go to zero VAT with some necessities of life, immediate necessities, as was done in Spain. And of course, by reducing the Special Consumption Tax to the lowest permissible levels provided for by the EU and abolishing the payment of the Special Consumption Tax for farmers and livestock farmers. Because in this country, farmers and livestock farmers are obliged to pay the excise duty. Others are not entitled to it. There must be justice and, in particular, we must support the weak, those in need.
