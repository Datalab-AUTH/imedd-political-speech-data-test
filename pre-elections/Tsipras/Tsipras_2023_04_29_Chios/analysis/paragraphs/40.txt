So let's go with determination for a great victory on May 21. Let's go to the ballot box. Two by two. Three-three. Let's get the Chianti mentality. Let's go cast the vote, the ballot of change for a better day, for a better life for the place. It is certain after what I see here in Chios today that change will be made on May 21. Bless you! Thank you very much for your welcome, for your presence. Good luck and good luck and good luck with the victory! Goodbye!
