The first thing that Mrs Kerameos did was to introduce the Minimum Admission Base and kick 20,000 students out of public universities every year. So we are addressing everyone today, all those children who are fighting their own fight, while we are fighting our good fight. Their own fight for the national exams that they will be taking in a few days and they are at home preparing in a competitive environment and we wish them all and everyone good luck. We tell them one thing, that political change and a progressive coalition government on May 21 will enable one of the first legislative initiatives that we will take to be the abolition of this miserable, invincible minimum entry requirement. So those who are taking exams should know that in June there will be no more of Mrs Kerameos' cut-off. 20 thousand students will have - more students will have the opportunity to access higher education.
