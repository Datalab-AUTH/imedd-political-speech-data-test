Why can we? We can, because we were not born princes with the sole family purpose of maintaining power as a family privilege. We do not believe that this state belongs to us, any more than we believe that this country belongs to us. The state belongs to the one it should serve, the Greek people. It is the sole owner. That is why we are the only ones who can change this state.
