I mean when we left in 2019. I don't want to claim that we had certainly managed to solve the big problems in health care. But we had, in adverse circumstances, supported public hospitals, we had put two and a half million uninsured people into public health, we had abolished the five-pound fee for outpatient admission. We raised the budgets of hospitals that could not even afford to buy gauze during the difficult years of the memorandum and we built 128 new local health units, because we believe in primary health care. So leaving. Here the Health Centre had 8 doctors in 19, today it has how many? So if we don't support the region, if we don't support our islands and especially if we don't support public infrastructure, health infrastructure, we can't talk about justice.
