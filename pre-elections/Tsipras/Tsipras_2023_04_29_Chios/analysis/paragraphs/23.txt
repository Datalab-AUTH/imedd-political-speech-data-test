I want to say to Mr Mitsotakis that it is a waste of time. The only way for them not to vote for anything other than New Democracy, not to support change, not to give a strong message at the ballot box by voting for SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance to change their lives. It's to deny them the ability to go to the polls. as it did for 250,000 seasonal workers that doesn't give them the ability to go to the polls. I see him moving very actively in the last few days, shutting out anything to his right in case he loses votes from the right. We want to bring him back to reality. No matter what he does, people have figured out these four years have been four wasted years for working people, for working people, for creative people, for young people, for small and middle class people. The many want change, no matter how much he blackmails, no matter how much he terrorizes, at the ballot box he will get an answer. So much for terrorism, so much for blackmail, so much for family rule, so much for obscenity, so much for the labour jungle, so much for injustice, on 21 May justice returns to this land.
