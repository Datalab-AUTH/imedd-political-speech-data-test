To pensioners. They've got a better outlook for better pensions, don't they? Remember? They accused us when we were fighting the battle with the cattle and they were shouting "Stop it, Sch√§uble, stop it, Geroun" and they accused us of giving the pensions that they wanted to cut by 30% but we did it, they said, in order to exchange the pensions for Macedonia. Isn't that what they were saying? Without shame. Without shame, they said that.
