We have applied for all islands and for your island. One, a major reform, a vision of decades, the transport equivalent. The transport equivalent has been gnawed, gnawed and discredited. They don't give the payments, they devalued it because they took out important categories. We believe in the transport equivalent. And we say that not only will we implement it properly, not only will we give the payments on time, but we will extend it for students who are in school, on the islands where they have schools, and for visitors, to increase island tourism, giving a boost to island Greece and showing that our islanders are not second-class citizens.
