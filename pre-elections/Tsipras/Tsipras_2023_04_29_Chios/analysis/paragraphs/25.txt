So that is why we say that this is the first opportunity under normal conditions to implement a government of progressive cooperation, a programme of breathing space, social support and economic recovery, a programme of real change, and this is the plan that we presented yesterday. We have made it public. Four things, they say. So that you can tell your fellow citizens, the people of Chios here, what will SYRIZA do in a government of progressive cooperation? Four basic things: wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair and efficient state. This is what SYRIZA will bring.
