So we say, we now know and we can. We know, because we governed in the most difficult conditions and we achieved what 3 consecutive governments failed to do and we learned from our mistakes. We look from experience and knowledge, it is true. As it is not only that we "know". We know how to do it and what to do, it is also that we can do it now, because this is not the second chance, but the first chance to govern by implementing our program. No coercion, no memoranda, no problem. We governed with the obligation, the national obligation, to clean up the public finances in order to get out of the memoranda, to get the country back on the markets, and we regulated the debt and collected 37 billion. They found what was ready and ate from what was ready and not only did they not have the obligation to collect because we collected it, but they were able, because of the pandemic, to spend 60. And I ask you if we, instead of having the obligation to collect 40, had the opportunity to spend 60.  Would our hospitals be like this today? Would our schools be like this today? Without teachers? Would this be the kind of state we'd have? Wouldn't we be supporting the weak, the small and medium sized businesses wouldn't have funding? You know it wouldn't be like that.
