Thank you very much for this very warm welcome here in Chios. In a gathering that I did not expect to be so large at noon on Saturday. But the gathering is twice as big as I expected, because you Chians go two by two. And so two-by-two we're also going to the ballot box to bring change. For the country to breathe again. Because this "two-by-two" some people misunderstand it, they make fun of it, but it has a lot of substance. What does two-two mean? It means one standing next to the other. It means one supports the other. It means solidarity. It means strength in unity. That's what it means. It was wise of the Chians to first put this out. Merchants, open minds, refugees in this place, they made progress. And I think that's what we need today. We need that sense of solidarity, of unity, of collectivity that will give us strength. Because only together can we bring change in our lives, in our country, in our government.
