I want to say two words though, to say two words about the workers. I have just seen a shameful video circulating on the Internet, I do not know if you have seen it... a video of an employer in a company, with his employees, and with a look of cardinals, with a foreman, the Minister of Development, Mr Adonis Georgiades, next to them, blackmailing them, bullying them and terrorising them. He blackmails them, bullies them and terrorises them and says to them, I have told you worse another time and now I will tell you more gently. I am not a democrat. Be careful what you vote for. This is a picture that has now come out on the Internet because it was filmed but it is a common picture in workplaces. Mr Mitsotakis is intimidating, terrorising and blackmailing the workers who he has put to work in a labour jungle, a galley. He abolished the 8-hour working day, the obligation to pay overtime and collective agreements, and now he wants to blackmail the workers into voting for his boss, New Democracy, by appointing unscrupulous employers.
