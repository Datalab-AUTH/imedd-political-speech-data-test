The state we saw in the tragedy of Tempe. This state. Getting on a train and not knowing whether you will reach your destination, because some people made a buffet to put in a stationmaster, who was untrained, who had no previous experience, because some people wanted to privatise even critical services, the railway infrastructure, and of course they were undeterred a few days after this party tragedy, this tragedy which they tried to manage in a communicative way, with shows, with ministers going to some antiquated consoles and want to convince us that this is supposedly telecommunications, because there was a fire in the summer of 19 and destroyed the telecommunications in Larissa and none of them thought about the need to restore it. And instead of making an apology? They put on a show. In front of the cameras. That's them, the ministers. So instead of apologising, what did they do a few days later?
