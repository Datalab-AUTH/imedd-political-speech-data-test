But you know, when you get to the point of seeing images and learning news like we've seen in the last few days. That the only doctor in Serifos resigned, that a pregnant woman in Corfu lost her child because a super puma plane was not available in Corfu, on a large island, to take her to the university hospital in Ioannina. And that in Kastelorizo the day before yesterday, a young girl was taken to Antalya and not to Rhodes because there was no super puma. We should be happy about the Rafale. We should be happy about it, but if we don't have the ability to protect our islanders, we don't have doctors, we don't have hospitals, we don't have air ambulances. That is our national duty, to protect the integrity of our country, of course, but to protect our citizens, our islanders, so that they do not feel that they are second-class citizens.
