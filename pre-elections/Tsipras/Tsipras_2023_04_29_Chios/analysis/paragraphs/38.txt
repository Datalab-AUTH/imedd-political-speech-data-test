So I say in closing, citizens of Chios, in this very warm welcome you have given me today, that on May 21 we have a great dilemma before us. The great dilemma before us is whether the country will continue for another four years on this path of devaluation and deception, of plundering income, of widening inequalities. Whether we will take the big and decisive step of change to put society back on its feet, to give a voice to those without a voice, to empower the working and middle classes. And this dilemma, which I said very descriptively, is summed up in this sentence. So we believe that the vast overwhelming majority of citizens have decided: change. And a progressive, cooperative government that will put society and the economy back on its feet.
