What exactly is going on? Mr. Mitsotakis' government is one of the few governments in the European Union that is keeping indirect taxes high when inflation has gone up. It has approached and exceeded 10%, and especially on consumer food products it has remained above 10% for months. Even now at 14%. What does "keeping VAT and indirect taxes high with such inflation" mean? It means that where the state used to take, when the prices of goods, a product made 10 â‚¬, it took 24. Now that it had gone to 20 euros, it will get 48. An increase of 4 and a half billion in the public coffers by maintaining at these high prices the value added tax. Four and a half billion in state obscenity. And what does that money do? They are supposedly giving subsidies, but the subsidies do not go into the pockets of the citizens, they go to pay the bills and keep these gentlemen's prices high in supermarkets and petrol stations and electricity. So in reality they are plundering consumers' money from the high VAT, mainly the middle classes and the weak, that is to say the vast majority, so that this money can go into the pockets of 5 large energy companies, 2-3 refineries and, of course, all the business groups that have set up cartels in the food sector. This is the picture in Greek society today.
