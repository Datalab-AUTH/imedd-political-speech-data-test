But those who then pretended to be super-patriots and complained about our foreign policy, which upgraded the country, where are they today when Turkey is campaigning all over Europe for its tourism, calling it Turkish-Aegean? Turkaegean. So where are these super patriots today? Where are they to defend our soul, our name, our Aegean? Where are they? They are nowhere. And they are nowhere because they had presented themselves as excellent, but rather forgot to put an X between the words. They're not excellent, they're useless. Because only useless people could hand over the name of the Aegean to Turkey to run an advertising campaign for tourism.
