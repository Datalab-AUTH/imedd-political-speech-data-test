Citizens of Thessaloniki, a few days ago the outgoing Prime Minister, in one of his public appearances, asked us to judge and compare. He asked citizens to judge and compare New Democracy with Syriza, Mr Mitsotakis himself, his boss, with me. So I say, he said it very well, to judge and compare. Of course, he avoids like the devil avoids a direct comparison in a TV debate between the two of us, face to face. And he's probably right, as we saw the other day, in the showdown with the six, he missed a tough question and started to testify without a stick. Since he wants us to judge and compare we say: fine, let's judge and compare. So let's go!
