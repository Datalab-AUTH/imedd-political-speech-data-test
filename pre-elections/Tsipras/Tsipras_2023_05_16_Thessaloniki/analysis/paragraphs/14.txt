You don't even care about the National Health System. You have devalued, dismantled, left the corridor open to obscenity. Result? A record negative in the western world in deaths as a proportion of the population, 37,000 of our fellow citizens lost, many of them unjustly. Because when they were dying outside of ICUs, you guys were calling us out in Parliament for claiming that "outside of ICUs our fellow citizens who are intubated are dying" and telling us: "How do you know? You know?". Well, yes, we knew it, but you knew it too. You knew it because you had the reports in your drawers and you were a hypocrite, because you did not care.
