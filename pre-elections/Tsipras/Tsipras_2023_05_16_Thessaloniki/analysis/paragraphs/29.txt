And today we can look Greek citizens in the eye and say: we know, but now we know and we can. Because we are not asking for a second chance, we are asking for the first chance to govern outside the memoranda, outside the constraints, without the Troika, without Sch√§uble. And the Greek people will give us this opportunity. We have the determination, but we also have the people who are experienced and younger, scientists who are close to society, people with calculation and vision. We also have the programme, the plan to implement it. We have, of course, been told lately that our plan is unworkable. We answer them: Our programme is costed euro by euro, drawn up through years of dialogue with social groups, confirmed by leading expert technocrats and scientists. Those who find it unworkable are those who know that it is very workable; they find it unworkable. And why? Because they fear its implementation. And I refer to the big interests of widespread corruption.
