You, Mr Mitsotakis, your Party, you have bankrupted the country, you have plunged the economy into the swamp and society into despair. We brought the country out of bankruptcy, we freed it from the memoranda and the guardianship. You left the funds empty so that we could not even pay our pensions. We handed them over to you full, you found them with 37 billion thanks to our respect for the last euro of the Greek citizen, thanks to our clean hands. And above all you have plundered society.
