Some people can't tell us that it is the same Syriza programme that will change all this, as the New Democracy programme that implemented it. They cannot insist on an unhistorical rhetoric that reminds us of times of great mistakes by the Left itself, which led to political tragedies. They cannot tell us 'what Plastira, what Papagos, what Syriza, what New Democracy'. And they will take responsibility for their choice on 22 May. Just as some people cannot tell us that they have, and indeed exclusively, the intellectual legacy of Andreas Papandreou and not respect his basic principle: that he never made a two-front, but had only one front against the Right. So we also say that we have only one front: the right-wing of Mr Mitsotakis, the worst right-wing since the post-war period. And we extend the hand of cooperation to all progressive forces, but also to every democrat, progressive citizen who wants to change his life in the next day.
