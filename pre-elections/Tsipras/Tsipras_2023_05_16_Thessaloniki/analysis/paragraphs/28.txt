Because adventure is what we are living today at a huge cost, and not just financial cost, a cost of dignity, I would say. A cost of life. Because there is no stability without justice, there is no stability without democracy, there is no stability without social cohesion, without trust. And that is why there will never be stability without political change. Only change will bring stability to our country. And SYRIZA is today the great force for change, but also the great force for stability, the most effective force for stability. We have been tested in difficult times, we have faced a state of siege with responsibility, but with determination, with maturity, with careful choice of every step. That is how we kept Greece standing, that is how we restored democratic and social stability.
