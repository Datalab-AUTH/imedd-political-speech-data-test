You don't care about public education. You have entrusted Mrs Kerameos to put barriers to the entry of thousands of children from the grassroots, mainly from the grassroots, to the public universities of the country to become the prey of the colleges of the rapists, for a price. You have devalued dozens of university institutions, mainly in the region, closed down schools, did not hire professors, but only rushed to hire police officers in the universities.
