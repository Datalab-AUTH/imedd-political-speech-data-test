But it will not be costless, it will just as much benefit young people, people of production and creation. And not only for the workers, but also for the small and medium-sized enterprises that cannot even get out of the banks today, for honest entrepreneurs.
I want to say a few words to you, citizens of Thessaloniki, about this Contract for Change that we submitted a few days ago to the judgment of the Greek people. And we ask the Greek people to go to the ballot box knowing the 11 articles of this Contract. But let me briefly say their meaning, so that everyone knows what it means to vote for Syriza on the coming Sunday. I will say four things. A vote for Syriza means: Wage increase, price reduction, debt settlement and a fair, efficient state, a strong social state next to the citizen. That is what a vote for SYRIZA means. By voting for SYRIZA, all these things will happen. Along with the restoration of institutions and democracy, the strengthening of public health and education, the protection of the weak, the protection of culture and the environment, the protection of people with disabilities, the support of women and young people.
