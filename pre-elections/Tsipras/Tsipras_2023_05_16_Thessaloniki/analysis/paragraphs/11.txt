To continue the comparison. Since he asked us to make a comparison, let's do it from here in Thessaloniki. We, with our national interest and the interest of Macedonia in mind, took the cost and solved a chronic problem with our neighbours. We defended our patriotic duty and signed an agreement after tough negotiations. We thus averted the danger of our neighbouring country becoming a base for forces that are preying on Greece. Today it is our country's warplanes that monitor the airspace of North Macedonia, not Turkish F-16s. Today on our northern border we do not have a Libya. Today on our northern border we have neighbours who want to be our friends and are our friends, not our enemies. Today on our northern border we have a country that is not called Macedonia, and no one will force us to call it Macedonia, because they themselves are now constitutionally called North Macedonia.
