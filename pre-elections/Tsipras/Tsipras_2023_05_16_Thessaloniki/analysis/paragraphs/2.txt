And the countdown has begun for the Mitsotakis regime. Five days are left for the Greek people to sign the Contract of Change, change with democracy and justice. And I believe that after our rally here in Thessaloniki today, I say, if he asks us, let's not be rude. Let's send help to get his stuff out of Maximou. Let him pick up the Predator wires, the wiretaps and the illegal wiretaps. Because from Monday, the Maximus Mansion will reopen its doors to democracy, it will become the headquarters of our great effort to bring Change and Justice to the land.
