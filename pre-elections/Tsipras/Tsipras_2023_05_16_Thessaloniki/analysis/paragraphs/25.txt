You can say this slogan to me on Sunday, on Sunday night you will say this slogan. If we have a victory for New Democracy, we will have a cover-up of the biggest scandal of the post-independence period and no one will ever know who is keeping the surveillance data. They listened to ministers, they listened to political leaders, they listened to MPs and SYRIZA MPs, they listened to journalists, they listened to businessmen, they listened to the heads of the armed forces, critical elements for the security of the country. Where are they all? Where are the recordings? In whose hands are they today? Who will use them tomorrow to blackmail the political system, to blackmail the business world, to give the military critical information? Who? Mr. Mitsotakis is the one who must answer and he will answer only with a SYRIZA victory and a progressive government and the performance of Justice. He will answer to the Greek people and to democracy for its violation.
