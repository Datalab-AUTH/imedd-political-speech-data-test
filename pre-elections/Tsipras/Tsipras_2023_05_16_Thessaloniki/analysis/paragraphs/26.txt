Citizens of Thessaloniki, some people tell us that we are regurgitating slogans of the past. I want to tell you something: change is not a slogan of yesterday, because it has become a need of today. And it has become a necessity of today because it has been made relevant again by the worst right-wing government since the post-war period. It is not a slogan, it is an expectation, it is a hope, it is a need. Because we are not just talking about change in government, we are talking about change in our lives, we are talking about bringing justice back into our lives, we are talking about bringing democracy back into power. That is what we ask for, that is what we expect, that is what we fight for, and that is what we will achieve together on Sunday with our vote.
