But the time has come, citizens of Thessaloniki, instead of starting the evictions for the people of toil who will lose their property, on Sunday you will evict Mr. Mitsotakis from the Maximou building. On Sunday, we have a great opportunity to put an end once and for all to obscenity, indifference, injustice and family rule and to give democracy a breathing space. For it was even democracy itself that was affected by the four-year presence of the Mitsotakis Government, with the Petsas lists, with the persecution of journalists. They have put freedom of the press to shame in the global rankings. With their nephews and security guards, whom they appointed without degrees to the NSS, violating every democratic and moral norm, they set up a parastatal mechanism inside the Maximos building.
