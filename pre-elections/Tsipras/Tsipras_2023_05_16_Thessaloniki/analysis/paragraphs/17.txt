We have an obligation to build a state that does not scare, but protects its citizens. A state that does not appoint people to critical positions with party buffers. A state with meritocracy, with accountability, because that is what it means to become Europe. We were told to 'stay in Europe', but in the end we were removed from Europe, because what we are living in today is not Europe. This state is not Europe. But it does not care about anything and it does not care about the lives and the future of workers, of young people in particular. It has imposed a jungle labour regime. They even abolished the eight-hour working day, introduced unpaid overtime, dismantled the Labour Inspectorate so that the worker would not be able to find justice and legitimacy.
