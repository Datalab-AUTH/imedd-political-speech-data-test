They reduced the purchasing power of households with an income of up to â‚¬700 by 40%, according to Eurostat data. They reduced average nominal wages and average real wages in 2022, according to OECD data. They did not and do not care about what they made a flag in the 2019 election campaign: the middle class. Remember what they promised it? The sky with stars! And in the end, the middle class ended up living on food stamps. Vouchers to go to the supermarket, vouchers to pay the electricity bills, vouchers to go pay for petrol, everywhere and a pass has become our life. With expensive raw materials, expensive fuel, expensive indirect taxation, expensive services. It has made the poor poorer and the middle class poorer.
