But what did you do, Mr Mitsotakis, when we had this opportunity and we took the cost for the country? You railed against an agreement that you knew very well was beneficial to the country. You allied with the far right in your attempt to mislead the people. You took part in and covered up all manifestations of atrocities and even violence. You put, in short, your personal and party interests above national duty. To then come back as a government and not only uphold, but honour the Agreement. Ten days ago, Zoran Zaev even sent you a letter of thanks for fighting, and he thanked you for it, to get North Macedonia into the European Union. And well done, I say, well done and honour the agreement. But you are not honoured by this attitude, this attitude of hypocrisy, because you are a hypocrite, a populist who says one thing and does another. And if some younger people have forgotten, we have been reminded by Mr Mitsotakis, the worst right-wing government since the post-war period. He reminded us these four years of what it means.
