And I want to address here today, from Thessaloniki, the conservative citizens, the voters of New Democracy, who are ideologically divided from us, but whom we honour. Many of them, most of them, are honest people, and I want to ask myself, addressing them: do you tolerate this 'holy family' regime? Do you justify it? Do you tolerate it? Mr Mitsotakis has made New Democracy his family fiefdom. He has made a large party accountable for serious crimes against democracy, and now he hopes to be washed away with your vote. Will you accept it? Will you wash him out? Will you be complicit?
