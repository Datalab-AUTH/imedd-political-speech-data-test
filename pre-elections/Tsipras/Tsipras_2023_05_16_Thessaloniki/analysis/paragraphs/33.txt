I also want to tell them that a vote for SYRIZA is not just a vote for a party that claims power. It is the harshest punishment for the regime that governs us. Because the regime that governs us has only one fear, you know that. Its fear is that its favourite Prime Minister, Mr Mitsotakis, will be defeated. And Mr Mitsotakis will only be defeated if Syriza wins. There is no other choice. So, a vote for SYRIZA is the hardest punitive, anti-systemic, anti-establishment vote, because it is the vote that will bring down on the 22nd of this month this regime of injustice and exploitation, this regime of targeting young people. However, I would also like to say a few words about the progressive, democratic forces, because the contract for change that we have tabled is addressed to every citizen, but it is also addressed to every progressive force that is at least capable of grasping the needs of the times, that does not play games with Mr Mitsotakis by giving him gifts, such as these gifts with the strange 'Demeter' and the Schaeuble plans. But also to those forces that do not get trapped in convenient bipartisan, convenient for the regime.
