What did you do during these four years, despite the fact that you found everything in order? You have destroyed rights, incomes and lives. You had the opportunity to share from the ready-made we left you, but you preferred to divide it among yourselves, your blue locusts and your sponsors. We governed with the obligation to raise almost 40 billion in the treasury to bring the country out of bankruptcy. You, with the leeway because of the pandemic, to spend 60 billion. And I wonder, friends, citizens of Thessaloniki: What would Greece look like today if we, instead of being obliged to raise 40, governed with the freedom to spend 60? We would have decent public hospitals with doctors and nurses, we would have schools and universities with teachers and professors and a reliable welfare state.
