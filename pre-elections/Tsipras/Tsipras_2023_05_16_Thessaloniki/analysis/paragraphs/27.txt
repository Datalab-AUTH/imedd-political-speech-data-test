Citizens of Thessaloniki, "Sunday Short Feast". Mr Mitsotakis has been showing symptoms of panic in recent days. Strange for someone who has such a wide lead in the polls. Strange! He has resorted to the last line of defence, which, may I say, is the last line of defence of all authoritarian regimes. What is that? Fear. The spread of fear. Look, he says change means adventures, Syriza means adventures, while his regime means stability. Do you know what is happening here? History is repeating itself, but as a farce. Throughout our history, oppressors, conquerors, authoritarian regimes have always said exactly the same thing: "Don't resist, don't rise up, don't speak, don't even dream, because that means adventures." But our people have both memory and judgment.
