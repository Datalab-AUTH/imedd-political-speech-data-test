Mr Mitsotakis, as I told you before, in the first tough question, he confessed the day before yesterday, he confessed everything. He confessed that it is a scandal, but above all, he confessed that there was no national reason for this surveillance. But I ask myself: if there was no national reason, why invoke national secrecy in order to cover up the truth, to keep the light out, to hide everything under the darkness in the parliamentary committee? If there was no national reason, why was the NSA prosecutor illegally signing the provisions to monitor half the political system and is she still in office? Why has the judiciary not taken a step for nine months now? Shall I tell you why? Because the cover-up is a status quo in the Mitsotakis regime. Cover-up for the pandemic casualties, cover-up for Tempe, cover-up for wiretapping, cover-up for everything. Mr Mitsotakis got lost in the difficult times, he hid his responsibilities, he did not care about the needs.
