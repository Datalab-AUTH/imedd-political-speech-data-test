We say that what Mr Mitsotakis attempted was the biggest income redistribution the country has seen since the post-independence period. With the obscenity allowances, which he took from the marrow of the middle class and the weak. With the high VAT, which you dare not approach the supermarket with accuracy. But now the danger we have is that if he completes his task for another four years, we will also see the biggest redistribution of wealth the country has seen since World War II, I will say, not since the post-war period. And that redistribution of property will come with the auctions, if we let them. And I ask myself: how is it possible that a party that has borrowed and unpaid 400 million euros owed to the banks and a cabinet that has private debts of 12 million euros, has the audacity to put the property of the middle class up for auction for 10 and 50 thousand euros?
