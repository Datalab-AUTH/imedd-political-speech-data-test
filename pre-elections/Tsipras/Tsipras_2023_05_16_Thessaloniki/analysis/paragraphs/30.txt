For them it will indeed come at a cost, I want to be honest. Our programme will come at a cost to the funds, because they will not take the houses of poor people and the middle class. Our program will cost the cartels because it will stop the subsidies and the obscenity party. And it will also cost the day laborers, because it will stop the direct contracting party. Remember a video that came out ten days ago? They will be damaged, it's true they will be damaged. But human lives will benefit. Did you see a video a few days ago that came out? I believe you must have seen it, with an employer threatening his workers that if they vote for Syriza, he may even fire them and next to the Minister of Development, who is laughing. Well, this video proves that some people are indeed afraid to implement our program because it will cost them. Because direct awards will be cut. Because we're going to bring in collective agreements. Because we're going to give workers rights because they're going to stop taking excess profits out of the worker's marrow. Our program will come at a cost to them.
