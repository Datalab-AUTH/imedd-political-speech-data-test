But you don't care about the safety of the citizen either. You have dismantled the infrastructure and sold it off at a moment's notice. A tragic example is the OSE. You dismantled it, turned it into a field of partisanship and bribery, so that we finally arrived at this unspeakable tragedy in Tempe. We warned in Parliament at the time, the workers warned, but the Minister of the Tempi answered us: "Shame on you for raising a safety issue!". And he answered the railway workers with bans and bans. And now he wants to wash away the crime with the vote of our fellow citizens in Serres. We answer them: we do not forget the crime of Tempe, the 57 souls who were unjustly lost will find justice. We have an obligation not to forget this crime. We have an obligation, not just a moral one, to the families of the victims, whom Mr Mitsotakis recently insulted in a television interview, saying that they 'instrumentalise the tragedy'. Who? The people who lost their children! But we also have an obligation to the younger generation. Because if we forget, we will find ourselves in tragedies like this again.
