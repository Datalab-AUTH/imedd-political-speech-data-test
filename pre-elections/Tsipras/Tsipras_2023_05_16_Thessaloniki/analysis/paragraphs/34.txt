Why do you know something, citizens of Thessaloniki? Workers and young people and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs - but let me speak for the workers, because many people speak in the name of the working class - want to know what will happen on Monday, who will be the government that will govern the country. They want to know whether the workers will continue to work with unpaid overtime, without a Labour Inspectorate, without collective agreements, with low wages.
