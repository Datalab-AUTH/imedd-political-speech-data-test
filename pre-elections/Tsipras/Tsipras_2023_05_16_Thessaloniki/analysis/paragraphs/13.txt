What do you want us to compare from your administration? Your indifference, your arrogance, your unfulfilled promises? One phrase, I think, represents your tenure: You don't care. That is the phrase that accompanies you. You don't care about ordinary everyday people and their problems. You do not feel their struggles, you cannot feel them, and by your choices you are devaluing people's lives and the future of the country. You do not care and you devalue the state, you have made it a source of easy enrichment for your party army with billions of direct awards. You have made it a source of grant to obscenity, a source of bliss for those we have called 'blue grasshoppers'. You have doubled the post-employees, increased their salaries by 40%, multiplied the managers in the PPC, in the Public Utilities, to share salaries and bonuses. But at the same time you made the state a source of profit for the powerful, in large groups the funds of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. Twenty-year record profits for 15 listed companies with over 1 billion each, under the auspices of the state all this.
