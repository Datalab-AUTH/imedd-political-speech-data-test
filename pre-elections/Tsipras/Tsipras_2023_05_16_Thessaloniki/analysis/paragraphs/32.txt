Today I want to address young people in particular. I want to address the young people here in Thessaloniki, in the city where we have had the authoritarian behaviour of the police on campus, the students who are demonstrating, the students who are having fun without any provocation. I want to address the young people in Thessaloniki, who a few days ago flooded Aristotelous Square to demand water as a public good. I want to address the young people and say to them: your participation will decide the election result. Go to the ballot box, go to the ballot box to throw the polls in the bucket. Go to the ballot box to send Mr Mitsotakis home; go to the ballot box to bring Change.  All the great conquests of our people were made with the Youth in the front line. 450,000 young people 17 to 24. They will decide the outcome.
