Friends, I am sure from your presence today... You know what? Normally I would have to close this speech now, but I do not want to leave the Chamber, because your presence fills me with optimism, fills me with strength. We have never had such a large gathering in Thessaloniki and I do not want to leave the podium. On 22 May we want a new day to dawn for our people and I think the dilemma of these elections is clear to everyone. The dilemma of these elections is change or Mitsotakis for another four years. The dilemma of these elections is SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance or the continuation of injustice and exploitation. And I am sure the vast majority of young people, workers, the middle class have already made their decision. On Sunday the lies end. And on Sunday we want and you want the people, the democratic people, to celebrate in the afternoon, in the evening when the results come out. The cartels should not celebrate, the cartels should not celebrate, the obscenity should not celebrate, the powerful should not celebrate. We want Sunday to bring the victory of democracy and justice. We want our people to write history again, we want it to be a historic day again, the 21st of May to be written in history. Let us all go together to make this a reality.
