This is our Contract, the Contract with the people, the Contract of Change. And this is what Achaia is sealing today with its rally. This Contract, citizens of Patras, is the roadmap of our governance. And at this point I want to make it clear: The Contract of Change, which we ask the people to ratify, binds us all to the letter. I will not and we will not allow anyone and no one to deviate a single line from this Contract. Because we are asking for the first chance to govern without memoranda, to support the weak and the middle class.
