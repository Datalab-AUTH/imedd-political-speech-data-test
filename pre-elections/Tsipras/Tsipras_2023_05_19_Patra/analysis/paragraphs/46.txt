So I have one thing to say: The die is cast. On Sunday, SYRIZA will be the first party! On Monday we will have a progressive government. A four-year government. Stability. Prosperity for the people. Growth for the country. Security for workers and citizens. For a better Greece. Strong. Independent. Proud. Progressive. Creative. Citizens of Achaia, on Sunday evening, you can be sure that you will be celebrating again in this square. On Sunday night, it will be the people who will celebrate, not the interests. They will be celebrating the victory of SYRIZA! They will be celebrating the return of democracy to power, the return of justice.
