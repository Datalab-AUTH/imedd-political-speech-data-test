Citizens of Achaia! Yesterday Athens decided. Today Patras seals the Contract of Change! Our gathering today leaves no more questions, no more possibilities. On Sunday the nightmare ends, change dawns! I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this sensational rally and this message of victory, this message of victory that you are giving here today from democratic Achaia. I have chosen to close from here, from Patras, this election campaign, this election race, from Patras, Achaia, Western Greece, where the Right has always been and will always be in the minority. Because the message I am sending is that on Sunday they will be in the minority all over Greece! On Sunday, with the vote of the Greek people, we say good night to Mr Mitsotakis and we say good morning to Change! To a new Greece of hope, certainty and perspective.
