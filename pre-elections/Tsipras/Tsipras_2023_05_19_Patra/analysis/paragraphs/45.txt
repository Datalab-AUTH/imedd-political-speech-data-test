So I want to close today's rally, but also close two months of a campaign in which I have had the opportunity to be in almost every corner of the country, to bring you this message of hope, of victory, of optimism, and to ask you in these 48 hours to do your best to talk to the people who will decide the outcome. The people who will decide in the end, especially the young people. I close in the Patras of democratic struggles this beautiful, beautiful struggle, the struggle for change. I am closing in the Region that has honoured me, I have been a Member of Parliament for Patras and Achaia for these four years, and I ask you to realise: Change is already outside our doors, knocking on our doors. On Sunday, open the door with your vote! Today's vote has already sent you the message of victory throughout Greece. The people of Achaia today gave their own message, after yesterday's decisive message from Athens.
