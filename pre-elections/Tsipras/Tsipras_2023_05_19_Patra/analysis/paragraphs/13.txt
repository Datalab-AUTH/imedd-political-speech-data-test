How can the Greek citizens forgive him for his behaviour in the tragic accident at Tempe and especially his behaviour after the tragic accident, when 57 young people were unjustly lost? How can they forgive him for this brutal insult to the joyful parents of the victims in Tempe? For not even respecting their mourning and accusing them of instrumentalisation, as if the parents of the victims have in their minds whether Mr Mitsotakis has elections or not! He does not respect, he does not feel, he does not understand! How can one trust the future of this country to a man who does not feel? How can you trust the future of this country, of our children, for another four years to a man who does not feel?
