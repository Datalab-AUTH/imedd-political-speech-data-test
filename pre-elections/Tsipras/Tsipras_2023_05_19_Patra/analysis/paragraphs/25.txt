We commit ourselves to decisively strengthen the National Health System, the public hospitals that have been left to collapse. To build more Local Health Units, to recruit all the auxiliary doctors and contract nurses who fought on the front line during the pandemic. Bring in a new salary scale with 2,000 as the first salary for the first appointed doctor, so that young people and scientists do not leave abroad. Stay here, staff the NHS. And get nursing staff into the heavy and unhealthy sector.
