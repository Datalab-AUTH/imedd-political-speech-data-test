And it also says a suspension of all first home auctions until a new fair framework of regulation is in place. And today, citizens of Patras, Mr Mitsotakis came out to tell us that the suspension of auctions by legislative act is a constitutional absurdity. Who is saying this? He who signed dozens of legislative acts on direct awards to companies that were set up three days before these tenders were made! Who is saying this and why is he saying it? He says it because he does not like it. Because they will lose the funds, his friends won't be able to go ahead with the project, take people's homes and speculate. He says these things because he speaks as their spokesman. So we say to him, here in Patras: We will not do him any favours! We will save the property of the middle class.
