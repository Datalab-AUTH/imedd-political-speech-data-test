Finally, the commitment to change the state, the big patient. And you know what? Only we can change this spoils state and party fiefdom that the Mitsotakis government set up all the previous years and has now enlarged with an increase in the number of post-employees and bonuses for the blue cadres. Why only us? Because we were not born and raised as princes with the notion that this state belongs to us and is at our service. We grew up with the perception that this state has only one owner: the Greek people. The Greek people own the state and they are the ones who must be served! The Greek people are the only ones who can change it.
