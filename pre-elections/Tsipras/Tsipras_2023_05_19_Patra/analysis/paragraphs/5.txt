Because with their vote, the people will evict Mr Mitsotakis from the Maximou building this Sunday. Not Mr. Mitsotakis from the middle class! And I want to say it clearly: After yesterday's rally in Athens, after all the rallies we have held, which have nothing to do with this climate that the propaganda wants to create for us, which wants to terrorize hope, and after our rally here in Patras today, it is now obvious: Go away, Mr Mitsotakis. Today Patras is telling you. Go away! Pack your things from now on. Rip out the Predator cables there in Maximou! Gather the evidence of the crime. From Monday, the Maximus Megaron goes from being a centre of illegal surveillance to the headquarters of the Republic. It is once again becoming the headquarters of a progressive government that will take on the difficult task of getting society back on its feet, getting the economy back on its feet, and restoring hope to the vast majority of society.
