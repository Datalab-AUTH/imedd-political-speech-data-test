But I want to tell you at this point, and I have said this in other meetings, that in addition to the articles of the Contract of Change, we have the legislative act ready, because justice must be speeded up. The legislative act that we will sign with the formation of the progressive government. What this act says: It says three things: Reduction of VAT on food to 6% and zero for basic foodstuffs - milk, bread, baby food.
