But here we are today, at the last turn before the polls, in his last interview on his beloved SKY, he let slip and told us what his plan is for the middle class. His plan is, watch what he said, to punish and crush, that is what he said, those are the words he used, to punish and crush the borrowers who managed to save their homes from the Katseli law. That is what he said verbatim. And so we understood why in the last few hours he has been insisting so much that supposedly we have a hidden agenda in our programme. Because he wants this distraction to make people look the other way while he is getting ready to take away their property, to take away their houses in the auctions. And if some younger people did not remember or some older people forgot, he came to remind us what the right-wing means, the worst right-wing government since the post-war period, the government of Mr Mitsotakis. So we say it clearly from George Square today, so that all of Greece can hear it: On Sunday, Mitsotakis' plans for the largest redistribution of property that has ever taken place in the country since the Second World War, for 700,000 auctions of first homes, for 700,000 evictions, on Sunday, the Greek people will thwart these plans!
