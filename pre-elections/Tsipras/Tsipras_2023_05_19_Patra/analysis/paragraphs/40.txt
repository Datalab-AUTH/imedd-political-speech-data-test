Citizens of Patras, so my message to young people is: This Sunday we go together. Let us go together to end injustice. Let us go together to end insecurity. Let us go together to put an end to insults, to brutality, to inequality. Let's go together to throw the polls in the bucket. Let's go together to evict Mr Mitsotakis from power and the worst government of the post-revolution. Let's go to the ballot box to finally end this nightmare. That day is very close. That day will not be long in coming, as the song says. That day is coming in 48 hours. Victory Sunday is here. And with our vote, we can achieve a great victory for the people. So SYRIZA is first. But what will SYRIZA first mean? Above all, it will mean a mandate to form a progressive government the next day. Be careful, it will not be a mandate only to SYRIZA, it will be a mandate to all progressive forces, not only to SYRIZA. And it will be the mandate: Co-ordinate, take responsibility, give the people a government of change and justice.
