They say, citizens of Patras, the programme of SYRIZA costs a lot. And they are the ones who in one year gave 10 billion in subsidies to obscenity and as many more in direct commissions. I want once again to answer them: Yes, our programme is costly: Do you know to whom? It costs the funds that will stop speculating. It costs the energy, food and fuel cartels, which will stop speculating. To the 15 listed companies on the stock exchange, which had record profits for 20 years, over 1 billion each last year, while households had no money to make in the third week of the month. Yes, it will cost them. It's going to cost the "day laborers" of direct hire, too. Did you see the panic they're in? Because they know it's going to cost them. Did you see that video of that employer threatening his workers that if they voted for Syriza they would be fired, next to the gleeful Minister of Development? So we say to them: The workers are raising their heads from Monday. The racketeers on their bench from Monday.
