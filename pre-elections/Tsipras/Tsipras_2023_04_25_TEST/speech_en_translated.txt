Hello! Thank you very much for your presence and for your welcome here in beautiful Kos, in democratic Kos, in the democratic Dodecanese.

It is a great pleasure to be here among you tonight. And today I believe that all of us are present and present in a great invitation, a democratic invitation. A democratic call for the change that will come with the vote of the Greek people on 21 May.

I am very happy and excited to be here in Kos, in the Dodecanese. I know, and you know, that this invitation today, this democratic invitation, this very nice gathering, is missing a piece of our heart, a man, a great comrade who loved his country, who served his principles and ideas with vigour and dedication for his whole life: Nektarios Santorinios, whom we lost recently, and who, as Minister of Island Policy, did very important things for the Dodecanese and all the islands.
