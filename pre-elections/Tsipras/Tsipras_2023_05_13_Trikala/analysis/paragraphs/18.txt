So our programme provides for a wage increase, How? With an 880 euro minimum wage and a thawing of the three-year minimum wage with the 13th pension and retroactive payments to pensioners with a 10% increase for civil servants, because they have not seen an increase for 14 years. It holds. It is fiscally sustainable. We are being told the country to give raises. We can afford to give the first appointment of a doctor 2,000 euros first.
