And we respond to this world. It is a national necessity for the country's economy to have a primary sector of production. No economy and no country has been able to survive with only a developed tertiary sector of production. So we owe, we owe and we have planned a series of immediate relief measures for farmers and livestock farmers. Mainly they have to do with the introduction of a cap on so-called farm and livestock oil and the farm and livestock, farm and livestock electricity cap and the abolition of the excise duty on fuel for farmers and livestock farmers at the petrol pump. No going after and getting a refund at the gas pump.
