This is the Mitsotakis plan. The bleeding of the middle and the many and the support of the few and the powerful. Because the greatest redistribution of income in the past four years has been through the maintenance of low wages, but mainly through the maintenance of high indirect taxation, while prices have gone uphill. Four and a half billion euros more in the public purse from VAT alone to give subsidies. But these subsidies, as you well know, do not go into the pockets of households. The subsidies go directly to pay the energy companies to keep the price of electricity high. The subsidies go directly to go to pay high petrol prices, to go to pay high supermarket prices.
