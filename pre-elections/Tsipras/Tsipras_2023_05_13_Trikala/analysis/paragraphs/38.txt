These logics. What Plastira, what Papagos They have taken the popular movement too far backwards and I want to address our friends from the social-democratic world. Who do you want a social democratic government with? With Mr Mitsotakis, Voridis, Georgiades and Plevris? With them to form a social democratic government? We fully recognise your right to defend the political and intellectual legacy of Andreas Papandreou. But be careful. If there is one thing we should all remember from this spiritual legacy, it is that Andreas never had a front with the progressive forces. His front was the Right. That is why I repeat today, here in Trikala, that our front is one: Mr Mitsotakis and the worst government since the post-war period.
