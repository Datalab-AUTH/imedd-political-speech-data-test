So we say to young people, take your life in your hands, don't waste this opportunity. Next Sunday you have that chance. I also want to finally address those who are thinking next Sunday of somehow punishing the worst government of the last one since the post-war period by voting for anything other than New Democracy, thinking perhaps that the greatest punishment is to vote for something non-systemic. Yes, that's what some small parties call them. Simple proportional representation is our conquest and we believe in it and it is the fairness of the vote. But be careful. Simple proportional representation does not mean that simple logic is lost. The harshest punishing vote to the regime that governs us is the vote that will make it lose. And the defeat of New Democracy can only come with the victory of Syriza. Progressive Alliance. In this election. And I want to assure you here from Trikala by addressing other progressive forces. The victory of SYRIZA next Sunday is the one that will pave the way for the formation of a progressive coalition government the next day. And I want to address all the forces so that everyone can assume their responsibilities. Some people cannot tell us today that New Democracy and Syriza alike heard this from our left.
