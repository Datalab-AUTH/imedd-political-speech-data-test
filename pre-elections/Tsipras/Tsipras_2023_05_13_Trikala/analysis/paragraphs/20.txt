Well, we respond to this criticism. We governed the country in the most difficult circumstances and we know what it means to cost. Others are the ones who left the country with a 15% deficit and led it into memoranda and bankruptcy. We governed the country in the most difficult conditions, we regulated the debt. We left 37 billion in the public coffers and I ask I ask I ask if we had the leeway like Mitsotakis, instead of the obligation we had to get the country out of the mire and raise 40 billion. We had the opportunity to spend 60. Would this be the country today? Would these be the public hospitals? Would these be the public schools without teachers? Would these universities be without teachers? Would this be the welfare state? The answer. The Greek people know the answer.
