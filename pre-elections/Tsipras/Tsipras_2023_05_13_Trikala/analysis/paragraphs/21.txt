And yet, we ask, not a second chance. We are asking for a first chance to govern on the basis of our programme, on the basis of our will, not on the basis of our must. Because for four years they ruled with the Troika. So now we know and we can. We have learned from our mistakes, but above all we can. Because the country is out of the memoranda. The country does not have the constraints that it had when we are fighting the battle to get it out of bankruptcy. And now we can implement a programme that gives breath and perspective to the many, not profits or sky-high profits and super profits to the powerful, as Mr Mitsotakis is doing.
