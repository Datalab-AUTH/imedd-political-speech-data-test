This happened here because they left the National Health System discredited. They applauded, they made the frontline people, the doctors and nurses, but for four years they left them unprotected. The public hospitals and you know it all too well. You who have the picture here of what is happening in your own city in Trikala are without doctors and nurses I wonder too. And they are also laying off contract workers. And I am really wondering, since Mr Mitsotakis is asking us to cost the cost of the devaluation of public hospitals with our programmes? Where was his own programme and his own governance? How much is it?.
