Citizens of Trikala. I would like to thank you for this warm, fierce welcome you have given me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your presence here today in Trikala in broad daylight shows that those who have discounted that next Sunday the cartels and the powerful and the interests will be celebrating are wrong. Next Sunday the Greek people will be celebrating, and it is your presence and today's rally. This is the real poll for us. The real poll that shows that the desire of the great majority of the Greek people is that next Sunday a great change will come to our country and to our lives.
