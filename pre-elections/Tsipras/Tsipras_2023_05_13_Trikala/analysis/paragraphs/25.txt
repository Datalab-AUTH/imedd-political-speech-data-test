Mr Mitsotakis does not care and does not know the problems of the agricultural and livestock farming world. He does not care and he does not know. He is not interested in his relationship, it is only a relationship of communication, because he grew up in the palaces, as a prince, and he has no relationship with the ordinary people, with the people and their problems. So the problem of the farmers and herdsmen today is whether they will be able to have tomorrow to stay on their land. That is the problem. When energy costs have skyrocketed, when Greece is the only country in Europe that has this frightening difference between the price the producer pays in the field and the price the consumer gets on the shelf with a 300% deviation. When they see the electricity bills for their production, for the cost of production has gone up 10 and 15 times. So when they see all this and the middlemen are the ones who are actually running them, they wonder if they will say tomorrow in this place where they live. And I see many many farmers slaughtering their female animals to keep the herds from growing up they can't afford to buy feed. I see a lot of farmers thinking, stop sowing their fields. That's the big dilemma.
