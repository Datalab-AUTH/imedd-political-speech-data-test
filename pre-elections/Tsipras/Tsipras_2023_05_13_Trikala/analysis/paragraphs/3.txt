Because for 4 years now injustice has become the status quo in our country. For 4 years now, what the Mitsotakis government has managed to do is to widen inequalities, to make the rich and powerful richer, the poor poorer and the middle class poorer. Remember what he promised the Greek people four years ago. He promised better jobs, better wages, better pensions. He promised a staff state. He promised that he would support the middle class and what have we been living with for four years now; what is he leaving behind? Four years later, four years of unified government that took back the country that robbed the country of possibilities from the country that robbed possibilities from society. Middle class that he was supposedly going to support has come to live on food stamps. Coupons at the supermarket, coupons to pay for electricity, coupons to pay for gasoline.
