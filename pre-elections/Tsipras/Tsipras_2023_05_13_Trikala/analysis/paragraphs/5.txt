 And addressing today the pensioners, the people, the workers, the workers, men and women, who are now living without dignity. And I say to them, where are those promises that you were given that they would keep the 13th pension that Syriza gave you? And then they were saying that they are crumbs where are the promises of retroactive payments after the decision of the Council of State? Seven billion euros less for pensioners from the Mitsotakis government and most importantly for those with pensions up to 700 euros with the reduction in purchasing power. 700 euros in the pocket is not enough for the second, not the third week of the month. What is there to pay for? Electricity bills, rents, what to pay.
