We reply here that you atheophobes have had enough of giving 10 billion euros in direct awards and closed tenders to day labourers to take the jobs with companies that were set up three days ago. Here we have endured and endured only EUR 10 billion in subsidies to energy companies in a year and a half. Every time we are to talk about a pro-people measure we are asked where we are going to get the money. Every time they want to give a tax break, a tax break to the rich and big capital, every time they want to give money to the day labourers, every time they want to give a premium to the powerful, there is a way to do it.
