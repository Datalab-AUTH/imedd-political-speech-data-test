This is our plan, as well as to reform the state, this state, the partisan, the undemocratic, the Rousseffetological state. What does it have to do with our values and our ideals and how can we finally say that Greece is a normal European country when what is happening here is not happening anywhere else in Europe? You tell me a European country where a prime minister can monitor half the political system. To watch his political opponents, to watch the head of the armed forces from his office, to destroy the European rule of law and nobody says anything.
