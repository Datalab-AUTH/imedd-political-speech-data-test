Tell me a European country. Where you get on a train and you don't know if you're going to get to your destination because. Some people want to do a party buffet. Maria, uneducated and without any experience in a crisis. He can't control anything and we've lost 57 lives. Unjustly young children. This is the picture of today's Greece. We do not deserve this Greece.
