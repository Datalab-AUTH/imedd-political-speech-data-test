Tax the excess profits, the excess profits of the energy companies, the excess profits of the refining companies in the supermarket, the banks, so that we can give support to the Greek people, strengthen the public health system, strengthen our universities and our schools, our schools, have more professors in the universities, have more professors, not policemen in the universities. Police officers will go to guard the neighbourhoods, to confront crime, not in the universities, support people with disabilities; support working people, young mothers, young couples with another housing policy where young couples today cannot find a home. To regain public control of the public electricity company, the delta of the PPC, to bring it back by regaining 51% of the shares of the PPC. And a public pillar in the banking system, because today the small and medium-sized businessman knows that he cannot even get out of the banks. You know it and everyone knows it. That 96% of businesses in our country today overwhelmingly small and medium enterprises do not have access to new lending. We saved the banks from bankruptcy, we saved them with the blood of the Greek taxpayer, but with successive recapitalisations and today these banks that we saved with the Greek people's money want to make profits to give to their shareholders. So we are saying that at least one bank will be under public control to guide competition. For the benefit of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship for the benefit of society.
