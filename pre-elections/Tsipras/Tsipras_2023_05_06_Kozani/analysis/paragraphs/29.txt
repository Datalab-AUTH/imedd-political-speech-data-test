So from here in Kozani I want to give a strong message and I want it to be heard everywhere in the country. The correlations have already been reversed. Do not listen to what they say and what they write; they always say the same thing, they always write the same thing. Look, talk to the people around you in these 15 days or so left. Go out and talk to people in coffee shops, workplaces and explain to them the great importance to their lives of having a big change on May 21. The great importance of who the cartels and the powerful will be celebrating on election Sunday night. The democratic people will celebrate and only with a SYRIZA victory will the democratic people celebrate. Mine. The feeling that I go everywhere, from one end to the other, all over Greece. It is that the rallying that we have is the greatest I have seen since 2015. My, the sense of mo where I am and where I stand no one has told me that we voted for you in 19, but now we will not vote for you no one has told me, I don't know if anyone has told you and I remind you that in 10, 9 12, 9 after the attrition, the governmental, after the defeat from the day of the defeat we got almost 32%. So we don't have a percentage limit our limit is a great victory and our limit is the sky to rebuild Greece a just society, a country worth living in, to bring our children back, to stay here, to support the weak, to support the middle class, to have a country where we all live with justice. That's our vision. That's our plan and together we can make it happen. We know we can and we will bring about change, bless you? This is the message of Kozani.I thank you warmly and this very large gathering today, a gathering that gives a message of victory again SYRIZA is first in Kozani, again a government that is progressive, democratic, to breathe again. Hello. Hello. Hello. Good strength. Hello.
