But he also targeted the residents of Western Macedonia and especially the residents of Kozani. And I think that what he did. Both with the privatization of the PPC. Just before the energy crisis came, but also with the no plan for the forcible de-lignification, it was not just a crime for Western Macedonia and Kozani. It was a national crime, it was a national crime, because it was largely due to the fact that Greece has the most expensive electricity price in the whole of Europe. This is not justified. That is where the fact is due. That we are today on the verge of energy poverty and energy insecurity. Citizens of Western Macedonia, citizens of Kozani. You know and we know how difficult it is to face complex challenges such as the climate crisis. We knew this and before we prepared a plan for the energy transition. We had prepared a plan that gave a smooth transition to the new era, to renewable energy sources, but not to gas. A plan that had a horizon of 2032 and Mr Mitsotakis came along and suddenly said that the plan for denuclearisation would be completed by 23.23 He gave an interview to the German newspaper Bild and explained what that plan was. It was a plan for German companies to do business. But the energy crisis came and it was running. He was running to cover up the uncovered, to CONTROL the uncovered. It drove the lignite plants to closure. How could he possibly bring them back in a short time? So this plan could not, to a large extent, the Mitsotakis no plan did not secure any substantial European resources for the energy transition and left the citizens of an entire region of Western Macedonia at the mercy. This non-plan is largely responsible for the electricity prices, but it is mainly responsible to a large extent. For the rapid increase in unemployment in your county and your region.
