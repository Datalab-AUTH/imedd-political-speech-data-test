It's time to talk again about working people, about working people and it's time to formulate a plan where no one is left behind. Mitsotakis promised in 19 better jobs, better pensions, better wages, and what he has achieved, because it is a feat, is that our country has a negative lead in everything in Europe. What he managed to do was to make the middle class that he was supposedly going to support live on supermarket vouchers, coupons to pay for electricity coupons to pay for petrol. What it succeeded in doing was to cheat the pensioners who were deprived of EUR 7 billion. By abolishing the thirteenth pension that we introduced and then he said it was a soul, but he abolished it and by depriving them of the retroactive payments decided by the Council of State. What it also managed to do was to target young people and young workers, abolishing the eight-hour week, introducing unpaid overtime and targeting youth, putting barriers to education, to access to higher education.
