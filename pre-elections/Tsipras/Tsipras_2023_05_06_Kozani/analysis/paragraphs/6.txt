It was the government of SYRIZA that, in very difficult fiscal conditions, the most difficult that the country has ever faced. We received a bankrupt country, however. We managed to support the public hospitals, which at the time were in complete disrepair. Remember two and a half million of our fellow citizens were outside the public hospitals because they were uninsured, and we said no citizen can be left out of public health care because they have not regulated their insurance contributions. Mr Georgiades was then putting â‚¬5 in the outpatient clinics and saying he would not take the credit. Paul Thomsen, do you remember that? That's what we lived through together.
