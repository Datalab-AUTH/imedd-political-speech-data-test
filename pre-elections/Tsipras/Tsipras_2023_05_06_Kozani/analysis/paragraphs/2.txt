Friends, citizens of Kozani, I want to thank you for your overwhelming presence and reception today. It is a reception that reminds us of other days, days of great triumphs for the democratic party and days that we remembered when here in Kozani we gave the message of victory and brought SYRIZA first, so we will bring SYRIZA Progressive Alliance first again in Kozani and throughout Greece on 2 Sundays from today. Citizens of Kozani, citizens of Kozani, today I want to speak to you from the heart in an election rally, different from the others, as you can see, I speak from the chest. I have no papers in front of me to read to you because I want to tell you what I believe from the depths of my heart. And I believe that your law, Western Macedonia, your region is an underprivileged region and an underprivileged prefecture and it is time for us together to put the region of Western Macedonia back on the map. Because there are no first and second class citizens.
