So I want to address everyone today. Not only to progressive and democratic and conservative citizens. Because I know. That conservative citizens today are deeply dissatisfied and disappointed; they are deeply dissatisfied and disappointed, and they are perhaps ashamed of much of what Mr Mitsotakis has done, who has turned a historic party into a Mitsotakis A Epsilon party, as the late Fofi Gennimata used to say. And I want to say to them. That in this election. Don't think that because it is. This is a simple proportional representation election. It will not be a simple logic election at the same time. Who will come first? He will have the first say and he will form a government, and the dots will be cast, to put it popularly, between the first and the third party, so that's why Mr Mitsotakis, Mr Skertosos revealed to us in a question the other day that he will get the exploratory mandate if he comes first. And he will attempt to form a government, we saw what he did in the right-wing block of flats, he dropped a bomb in the right-wing block of flats the day before yesterday and all the flats of those parties that had not openly declared that they would support him if necessary collapsed and only those who have declared that we will support him are left. He supposedly wanted to get the cassie out. That's what he was telling us when he could not only stay out but not campaign from prison which he did for 3 years and no one stopped him from doing. With a simple injunction. He didn't want to, he wanted to make an order to give the A1 a division of the Supreme Court to give the judges the discretion to determine that is to say which, can, cannot so that along with the cassiter there were 3, 4 other pieces that didn't make it for Mr. Mitsotakis to be in the electoral contest in the electoral process.
