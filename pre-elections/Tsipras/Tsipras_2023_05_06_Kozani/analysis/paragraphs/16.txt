So we are living a great injustice, why? Because while all this is going on, 15 large companies, large business groups listed on the stock exchange had in the past year a record profitability of the last 20 years and a 20-year record profitability with over a billion in profits each. And so we say, it's fair, it's fair when most the vast majority can't make it through the month, some people are hoarding this injustice, we're going to come and redress it and that's our commitment. We will not come, we will not come this time. Just to get the country out of bankruptcy. We will come not to get the country out of bankruptcy, but the households out of bankruptcy. That will be our goal this time to get households out of bankruptcy.
