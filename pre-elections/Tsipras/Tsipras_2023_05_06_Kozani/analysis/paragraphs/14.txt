He found everything ready, he found money in the coffers, he found the economy on rails and he ate off the ready-made. And while we were obligated to raise 40 billion in the coffers to get the country out of bankruptcy, he had the ability after the pandemic to spend over 60 billion and I ask you what comparison, we can make if we, instead of being obligated to raise 40 with fairness had the ability to spend 60 with fairness where the country would be today. This is what public hospitals would be like, this is what public schools would be like. That would be the welfare state? No, that would not be the welfare state and every Greek woman, every Greek man and woman knows this very well. So we are asking for the first opportunity to get the country out of the crisis, not out of the crisis of bankruptcy this time, but to create conditions of justice.
