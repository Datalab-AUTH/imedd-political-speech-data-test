So let's keep in mind. We vote with our hearts and our conscience. But we do not vote loosely, because the only way to avoid it is to thwart this plan. Mitsotakis is the victory of SYRIZA Progressive Alliance in the simple proportional representation elections. The clear victory that will pave the way for change.So the dilemma of the ballot box is, do we change or do we continue to sink? The dilemma of the ballot box is, will a progressive government be formed that raises wages, restrains and lowers prices, and gives regulation a breathing space for households, or do we continue to be unable to get out of the supermarket? The dilemma at the ballot box is, will we see this tsunami of 700,000 foreclosures or will we provide fair regulation solutions to help the middle class retain their property? So the dilemma of the ballot box is a non sequitur, change is one. Mitsotakis the SYRIZA progressive coalition that is the only one that can bring change?
