The Syriza government in really difficult circumstances? It is complete. The fifth station in Ptolemaida. Set. The relocation of Akrini and all relocations. It was the SYRIZA government that established the institution of energy communities so that we could tackle energy poverty and make communities the small communities of everyday people, communities of self-producers and self-consumers. It was the SYRIZA government that brought in the reduced social tariff for electricity for the residents of your region; but also for businesses.
