And while I'm talking about the kids, the news. While I'm talking about the minimum input base, because I know that even as we're here fighting the good fight for the election battle. There are thousands of kids who are in their homes studying to take the ELLs and I want a commitment to both those kids and their families with a progressive government on the 22nd. From these exams, the minimum entrance requirement will be removed. No artificial barrier to education, no artificial barrier. To young people to study in a public university.
