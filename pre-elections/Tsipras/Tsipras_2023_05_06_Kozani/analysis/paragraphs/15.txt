Because what we are experiencing today is a profound injustice. When the average household today can't make it through the month.In the third week of the month the income is going up, when according to all the figures that the European and international organizations say. Eurostat says that for those who have an income of up to 700 â‚¬ in the last 3 years, their purchasing power has fallen by 40%, the OECD said the other day that the average salary of those with a higher income i.e. the 2022 average real salary, fell seven and a half percent. So where are the best wages? What is the impact of the income that goes into the pocket of the worker, the employee, the small businessman? When in the third week of the month? They can no longer pay their bills. The electricity can not pass outside the supermarket. It has become a supermarket's great nightmare.
