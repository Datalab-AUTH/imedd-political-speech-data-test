I often say to citizens of Kozani that it is not fair to talk about us saying that we are asking for a second chance. No, we are not asking for a second chance. It is the first chance to govern on the basis of our programme, because in the first four years we received the dirty laundry that left us with a bankrupt country. A country with empty coffers, we received bankruptcy and we governed with the Troika. At the time when our political opponents in Greece, remember what they used to say, they used to say, "So now there is no such thing as Sch√§uble, there is no such thing as your friend Gerun; he was Varoufakis' friend, not mine. They don't exist now. Now each government can set its own priorities and that was the great achievement that we all achieved together in 2018, coming out of the memoranda. And of course this is largely due to the endurance and sacrifices of the Greek people. So we came out of the memoranda with the debt regulated with 40 billion in the public coffers. That's how much we left. It was picked up by Mr Mitsotakis, who told us that we were supposedly the ones who, while we were pulling the country out of the memoranda, signed a fourth one. Do you remember what he was telling us then? What happened to the fourth memorandum? He used this, he implemented this.
