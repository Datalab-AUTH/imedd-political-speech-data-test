In neighboring Grevena, where. There is a great political personality. What do you know? Mr. Patsis, a member of the New Republic, who had a profession. He had made a profession, at the same time as being a member of parliament, of going around and beating up borrowers like a crow. Who have a loan of €5,000 and asking him for €15-20,000. That was his job, Mitsotakis knew it, not only did he put him as a deputy, but he had also put his son, the coordinator of the non-performing loans department of the New Democracy. Because because that's their policy. This is the theory that Mr. Patsi put into practice. This is what Mr Mitsotakis wants to put into practice and he put it into practice by enacting the new bankruptcy code which for the first time provides for bankruptcy of a natural person that completely removes the protection of the first home and we see daily news like the one we saw today about the old man in Halkidiki 81 years old, the disabled man who was a guarantor of a loan of his unemployed son and he was thrown out of his house and he has no place to sleep disabled man. We will see these pictures every day from now on.If the policy does not change. So when we talk about the need for a big change, it is not because we are regurgitating the slogans of the past. It is because change has become the need of today and tomorrow for the country. Unless this government changes, we will not see a white day.
