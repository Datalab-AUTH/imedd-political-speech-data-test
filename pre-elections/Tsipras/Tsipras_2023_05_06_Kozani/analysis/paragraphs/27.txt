So that is why we are addressing both conservative citizens and progressive citizens throughout the Greek people, and we are saying that the elections of proportional representation will produce a government. It is not a loose vote election. It is an election of parity of the vote. What you vote for comes out, but the next day there will be a possibility of forming a government. Mitsotakis has a plan and with half a point to be first with blackmail, pressure and even defections. The family has the knowhow. He's known this since he was 65. Try to make the government a ragamuffin. A rag because he said it himself, he said it will have many colors, many colors. That's what he meant.
