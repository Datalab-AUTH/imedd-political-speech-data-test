Okay guys, don't ask for a debate now that we know. We know it's not coming. I've said it so many times I'm tired of saying it. Mitsotakis has so much confidence so much that even if he goes for an interview, the journalist he doesn't like will come and face me. He will not come to confront me. He will not come because he does not have one. Arguments for it will not be in all European countries. There is a televised debate between the main election contenders in all of them. But not only in Europe, United States everywhere and in Greece we are doing it.Don't you remember and I did it with Mr. Meimarakis, do you remember? And Mr Simitis and Kostas Karamanlis had done it again and again and before that there was always an open dialogue. But Mr Mitsotakis, even in Parliament, when he confronted me sometimes when things were getting difficult, he would take on the role of Speaker of Parliament and close the debate. The debate is over, he would say, we are leaving now. He is doing the same thing now, and now the debate is over, we are leaving, but he will come back on Wednesday. In a staged, in a staged, in a staged televised parallel monologue process, because the new democracy demanded that there should not even be a free question from the journalists, not even a dialogue between the leaders. But even this attitude says a lot to Greek society. Even this attitude says a lot to the Greek people.
