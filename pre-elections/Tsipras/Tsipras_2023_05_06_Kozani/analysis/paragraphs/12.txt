We also plan. To breathe new life into the great reform of the energy communities that New Democracy has discredited. The institution of energy communities is not for 10 large companies for 10 large business groups, it is for small energy communities that producers, farmers and livestock farmers will create. Local government. So that's where we need to give a basis, the government has devalued it by giving access to the grid only to the big guys. None of the small ones were allowed to have access to the grid. The fourth thing we will do is a serious spatial planning for renewable energy sources, a spatial planning that will stop this anarchy with photovoltaic panels springing up everywhere without control and without limits and without planning, and the last thing we are committed to. It is to give back to the local community, to the local government, the agricultural land that the PPC has taken over the past years, so that it can be used for development purposes for the benefit of the local economy. These are our positions and proposals that come to respond to the challenges of the energy transition with the triptych of tackling energy poverty, the country's energy security and a just transition. These are our positions and proposals and now can you compare what the new democracy has done for your country for four years now and what we have attempted in the most difficult circumstances?
