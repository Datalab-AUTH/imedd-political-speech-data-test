So this is our programme, friends. We presented it publicly the day before yesterday to the Greek people. We presented it publicly so that every progressive citizen, every democratic citizen, can know it. What do you vote for when you vote for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance? But at the same time. We submit it to the judgment of all progressive forces. Because we believe. That from this election the next day, if SYRIZA is first and will be first and by a wide margin, the way will be opened for the formation of a government of progressive coalition. So we are addressing, first and foremost, the citizens, but also the progressive forces, and we are saying to them, tell us which of these 11 articles you disagree with? What exactly would you like to add? A twelfth and thirteenth? We are being honest and we want serious answers. And the answer cannot be an unhistorical bipartisan one. Mr Koutsoubas told us the day before yesterday that the Syriza government was the worst in history. I remembered. Of what Plastiras what a parrot they used to say we have learned nothing from our recent history. Where did these wrong lines of the left at that time lead to? We have also seen Mr Androulakis, who wants to be the sole owner of the intellectual heritage of Papandreou Andreas. But one thing I have learned from this heritage and legacy is that Andreas had an opponent on the right, he had no bipartisan front, he had no front with the Left, he had no front with the progressive forces. I extend my hand to the progressive forces, I extend my hand because we have a front with the worst right-wing government that has ever passed through the country in these 49 years of post-independence, and that is the government of Mr Mitsotakis.
