So the plan of SYRIZA. To be imprinted in your memory. In 4 things it is very simple. Raising wages, lowering prices, regulating debts and a fair efficient state next to the citizen. This is the SYRIZA plan. We submitted it the day before yesterday. The 11 articles. Of our contract.With the Greek people we called it a contract of change. 11 articles that provide in detail for the interventions we have, both costed and deeply scientifically documented, I would say. Because you know something, our own scientists, our own technocrats are really excellent. They are not like the other excellent ones who have been put on the backs of the Greek people in order to make a buck out of a fly. It turned out in the end that many of them did not even have degrees. So we have prepared a plan with 11 axes. These 11 axes address both the critical issues of the need to increase income, the need to reduce value added tax, the need to reduce excise duty, the need to stop farmers paying excise duty, the need to control markets, the need to stop cartels from running riot, the need to stop the price in the field being 300% different from the price the consumer finds on the shelf.
