So we want a state next to the citizen that is not a fear for the citizen, that is security for the citizen, with public hospitals, which will provide security, with a state that is meritocratic, with more accountability, with more justice, and we are the only one. I would say, we can do it, you know why? Because we didn't grow up with the sense as princes that this state belongs to us? We don't own this state. The state doesn't belong to us, it doesn't serve our families. We are not lifelong politicians. We the state is to serve the Greek people and the needs of the Greek people. That is what the state is for and that is how it must be reformed.
