Today you are giving a message of victory, our gathering here in Kozani today shows the way to the great victory on May 21. The change that we so need in our lives in our everyday life will come. It will come not only in government. It will come in our daily lives and that is the message that your presence and your determination, your fighting momentum, is giving us today. It points the way to change, the way to great victory. You can be sure that on the evening of 21 May it will be the people who will celebrate, not the cartels, not the powerful, not the interests.
