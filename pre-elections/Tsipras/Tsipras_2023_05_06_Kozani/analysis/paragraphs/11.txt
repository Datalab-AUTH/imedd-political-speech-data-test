But citizens of Kozani. Today's reality is a painful reality for both your country and your place. And we come here to commit ourselves. That the next day, a progressive government with SYRIZA as its core, precisely because our central slogan is justice everywhere and justice everywhere means that we will not leave anyone alone, we will not leave any region alone, but we will not leave anyone in disrepute, and that is exactly why I come to commit myself. The next day we will have a special concern and plan for Western Macedonia. First of all. The energy mix of the country will go smoothly smoothly in the so-called de-lignification, not to emphasize gas, but renewable energy sources, and we will postpone the end date of the fifth unit in Ptolemaida. Because our energy mix cannot have no lignite when Germany's energy mix has lignite, but it will have reduced lignite, but it will have it at 20%. We will strengthen with a national transition plan, we will strengthen those resources in the transition fund so that we can create new jobs and a development perspective in your country with a grid of interventions and incentives and tax incentives we are introducing and it is our commitment, therefore, to introduce what we call a zero, development and social deficit clause, which means. That we are committed to jobs and to the gross domestic product of your country, they will not decrease, they will increase, and that is our goal to increase jobs and increase the GDP of your country. Because if Greece for many, many years, during the period of the industrial revolution, the period when Greece was based on lignite, if Greece had been able to stand on its feet with cheap energy, it owes it to you and we owe it to all Greeks. We must now pay you back and pay your country back.
