Many people accuse us of making mistakes. Yes, we have made mistakes. But I want to remember at this time a fine phrase spoken by a great fighter and a good friend of mine, the President of Brazil, Ignacio Lula da Silva. He said: "I prefer a Left in government that does what it can do, rather than a Right that does what it wants." Well, yes! We want a Left that does what it can to save society, to touch, to feel the needs of the people. And it will make mistakes. And not a corrupt right-wing government that will do what it wants.
