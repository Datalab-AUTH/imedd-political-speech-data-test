And this Contract, you know, is also a breathing contract. Not only for the weak, but also for the middle class. Because we have a moral obligation to support and give breath especially to the middle class, which was excessively and unfairly burdened with all the burdens of the memoranda and which was brutally deceived by Mr Mitsotakis in 2019. He promised them living rooms and reduced them to living on vouchers. Coupons for the supermarket, coupons for the petrol station, coupons for electricity.
