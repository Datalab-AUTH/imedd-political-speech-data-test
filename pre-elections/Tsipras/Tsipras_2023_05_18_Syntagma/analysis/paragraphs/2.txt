Our gathering today is the greatest proof to those who believe that the Greek people are ready to live another four years with the nightmare of inefficiency, inequalities, obscenity, and parastatalism. And we see it now everywhere, wherever we are, all over Greece. Hope has now become a decision. Because our people cannot bear another four years of arrogance, another four years of indifference, another four stone years. Because we can no longer bear the injustice that poisons and destroys our lives.
