But I want to address not only the progressive citizens, I want to address the voters of the New Democracy as well. We disagree, but we respect them. And I want to ask them: Does this behaviour have anything to do with your own codes of values? Is it relevant to your values, to the values of the party founded by Constantine Karamanlis, for a man to behave in such a way as to eavesdrop on his ministers from Maximou and to insult the parents of the children? He asks you today to give him with your vote the conservative citizens of New Democracy, what? An apology card. Why? So that he can be washed away and do much worse over the next four years, rebaptized with your complicity. And I ask you: Will you do him that favor? Will you be complicit?  Think twice and three times. And for the good of your Party, but above all for the good of our country.
