There is only one way to punish this system, this regime: defeat it at the polls. And the only way for the Mitsotakis regime to be defeated at the polls is for SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance to win at the polls on Sunday! There is no other way, young people! Therefore, therefore, a vote for SYRIZA is the hardest, the most profoundly anti-systemic vote. Because it is the vote that ends the Mitsotakis regime next Sunday, the vote that opens the door to the future. To the future of the new generation of this country. So I call on you, young people and young people, to participate in the ballot box on Sunday, with your vote, to send to the bucket the polls that are terrifying hope, change, the prospect of dignity in our country. And you, young people, on Sunday, evict Mr Mitsotakis from the Maximou building.
