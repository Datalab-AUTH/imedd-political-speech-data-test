Citizens of Athens, if I were to ask you what is the basic characteristic by which we have come to know Mr Mitsotakis as Prime Minister over these four years, you would answer that his basic characteristic is his lack of empathy, that his basic characteristic is that he does not care, he does not feel people's feelings and anxieties. He does not care about truth, about justice, about fairness, about philanthropy, even about people's lives. But what happened with the tragedy of Tempe, I must admit, is unprecedented. Such emotional indifference, such cynicism, such callousness - if you will pardon the expression - could not have been imagined. He surpassed himself. And I am not only referring to the tragedy and its causes. We were warned in Parliament, but without shame, the Minister of Tempe was telling us that we should be ashamed. The workers were warned, but, without shame, instead of a response, they were receiving reprimands and persecution.
