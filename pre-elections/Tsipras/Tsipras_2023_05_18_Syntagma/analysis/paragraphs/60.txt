But because neither you nor I can really say all this, so leave the unhistorical bipartisans and come to the table on Monday, after the great victory of SYRIZA, after the great victory of our people, which will open the way for the formation of a progressive government. Come and put aside our differences. We extend to you a hand of understanding, of cooperation to take the country forward. To give breath to society. Because, my friends, citizens of Athens, with a victory for SYRIZA on Monday, we can make change a reality, and we can make a historic dream come true, a dream that the elders in this square, in the struggles for proportional representation, remember. A historic dream, with a simple proportional representation, that the forces of progress, the forces of democracy, should govern together. And to bring democracy to power. Justice everywhere.
