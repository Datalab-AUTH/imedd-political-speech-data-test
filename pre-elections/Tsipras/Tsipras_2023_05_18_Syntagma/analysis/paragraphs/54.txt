Some of our comrades on the left say, some of them say, completely untrue: There is no difference, it doesn't matter. Really? Can you really look the worker in the eye, the one who has seen his labour rights crushed, the eight-hour workday abolished, unpaid overtime made law, the SEPA abolished, collective agreements disappearing, can you really look him in the eye and say: 'There is no difference, it's the same whether it's Mitsotakis or Syriza'? Then tell them to listen to the bosses, who are picking them up and threatening them, next to the jubilant Minister of Development, that if they vote for SYRIZA they will be fired. Tell them there is no difference, it's the same. Say it!
