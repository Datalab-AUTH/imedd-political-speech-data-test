So today we warn him here, from the Constitution, the Constitution of Democracy, the Constitution of the great struggles of our people. Here, because here, in this square, we had the great struggles of our people. Today we carry with us the history. We are not descended from palaces, that is where our bonnet comes from. From the great struggles of our people. On the 3rd of September. The struggles for bread, education and freedom. The Juliana, the great masses of people like the one of the 1980s for change, for democracy, for justice and again, here in the Constitution, in the struggles of our people. The struggles against those who wanted and still today want to govern instead of the people.
