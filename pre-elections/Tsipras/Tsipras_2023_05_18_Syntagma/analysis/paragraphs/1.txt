Citizens of Athens, today's gathering is a victory performance. It is the largest rally we have ever held in the Constitution! Today in Syntagma, the heart of Justice, of Democracy, of Change is beating! And it is a message to all of Greece, the message we are sending here today, all of us together. On Sunday, Greece turns a page. On Sunday we say finally end to the regime of injustice, end to the regime of obscenity, end to the regime of inequality! On Sunday, justice returns to our country. On Sunday the people speak and the people rewrite history. History will be written on May 21 on Sunday, with your vote!
