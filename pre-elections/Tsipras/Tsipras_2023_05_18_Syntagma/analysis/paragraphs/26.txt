And we ask the Greeks to judge us and to approve with their vote the Contract of Change that we propose. The roadmap of our governance, which gives the power of realism to the vision of justice. And I want to make that absolutely clear: The Contract of Change, which we ask the people to ratify, binds us all to the letter. I will not and we will not allow anyone and no one to deviate a single line from that Contract. The Contract that we call upon the Greek people to ratify. No one will deviate, either consciously or unconsciously.
