Maximum and unforgivable disrespect to the traditions of our people, who called the judicial struggle of the victims' relatives to find justice for their unfortunate children "instrumentalization". And he wagged his finger at them: "Their anger does not justify this kind of behaviour," he told us. This kind of behaviour! To whom? To the dumb parents. But what, really, can justify this kind of behaviour towards the relatives of the victims, not by the Prime Minister, but by a human being? How can anyone really trust his life to Mr Mitsotakis for another four years after this? How can one trust his children and their future for another four years to this man?
