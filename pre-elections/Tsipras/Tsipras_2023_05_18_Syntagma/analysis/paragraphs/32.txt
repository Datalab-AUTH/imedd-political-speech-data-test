We can and we will. We can decisively strengthen the National Health System. We can increase health spending to 7% at the end of the four-year period. Give doctors and staff the pay their profession demands. You know, in December '19, the NHS had 108,000 doctors, nurses, staff. In December '22, 84,000. That's the picture of the NHS today. Well, that is the picture we will come - a titanic and difficult task - to restore. Because, it found me a few days ago in Ioannina - and I want to tell you this..., No, I don't go there by state plane, I go there by car. I was found by an old woman who lost her husband four days ago and she couldn't come to the meeting. She waited outside the hotel for a long time to tell me what: "We are not asking you for buffers. We are asking you three things: Health, education and justice." That is what the Greek people are asking for, they are asking for dignity. Health, Education and Justice. We know and we can make it happen.
