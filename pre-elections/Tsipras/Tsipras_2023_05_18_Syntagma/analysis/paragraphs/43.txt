Citizens of Athens, I want to tell you something else beyond what our Contract provides for and we will put it into practice. We have already prepared, you know, because justice sometimes has to be expedited, we have already prepared the first Legislative Act, before the Parliament is well constituted, as soon as the progressive coalition government is sworn in, to sign it.
