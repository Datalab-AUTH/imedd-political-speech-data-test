But we address the Contract of Change to all citizens, but we also address it to the progressive forces of the country. Why? Because it is the basis on which we call for a substantial programmatic debate to begin on the day after the elections, after SYRIZA's victory, so that we can form a government of progressive cooperation that will have a long-lasting and stable future. SYRIZA's vote and victory will be at the same time a mandate from the Greek people for a progressive government of cooperation now, without further elections. It will not be a mandate only to SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. It will be a mandate to all the progressive forces of the country. It is their right to say what they say today.  But on Sunday none of us are speaking. One will speak: The sovereign people. And from Monday we will all be called upon to take our responsibilities. They will all be called upon to take a stand the next day. A clear victory for SYRIZA will hold everyone accountable.  Because we may have simple proportional representation, but that does not mean that simple logic ceases to apply. And simple logic raises a crucial question: Who do we want to govern the country for the next four years?
