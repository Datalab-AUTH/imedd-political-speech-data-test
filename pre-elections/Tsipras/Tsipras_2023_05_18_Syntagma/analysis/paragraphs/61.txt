So the dilemma of the ballot box, citizens of Athens, next Sunday, democratic citizens, progressive citizens who are listening to us, is one and every Greek citizen knows it well. And it is about who will govern us for the next four years. So the dilemma is: Progressive government or Mitsotakis? Change or Mitsotakis? And our people, the vast majority of the democratic people have made the decision. SYRIZA's victory and change. Victory for SYRIZA and progressive government from Monday! They have made the decision and our magnificent rally today shows it. And I call on Mr Mitsotakis not to hide tomorrow in Athens in some small alley in Thiseio, he who has the show of victory, who all the polls show him as the winner, not to hide! We are here, the social majority is here and at the ballot box we will show that there are more of us and more of us who want change.
