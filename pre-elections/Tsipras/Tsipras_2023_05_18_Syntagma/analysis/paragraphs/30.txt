We should restore the 13th pension that Mr Mitsotakis abolished and pay pensioners the retroactive payments. We can and we will do it. As well as enabling all pensioners to get increases under our law. And those who were denied increases now, when Mr Mitsotakis gave them.  We can and we will make it happen.
