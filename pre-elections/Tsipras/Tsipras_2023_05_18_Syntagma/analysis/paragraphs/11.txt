So, citizens of Athens, after our rally today, I want to give a piece of advice to Mr Mitsotakis. I advise him to start packing in the Maximou Mansion now! He should start untangling the Predator cables. Unravel the evidence of the crime. From Monday, Maximou will become the headquarters for the support of society. From Monday, Maximou will become the headquarters of democracy and justice. Because from Monday a progressive coalition government will take on the difficult task of repairing the wounds in the body of society, left behind by the four years of Mitsotakis. The people do not forget, but even if some people wanted to forget the worst right-wing government since the post-war period, they were reminded of what the right-wing means. And so now, with the power of the people, we will come to repair these wounds in the body of society and in the body of democracy.
