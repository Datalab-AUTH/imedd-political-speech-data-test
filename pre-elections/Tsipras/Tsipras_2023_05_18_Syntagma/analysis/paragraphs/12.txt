Because Mr.Mitsotakis has turned the Maximou Mansion from the Palace of the Republic into a centre of illegal surveillance and eavesdropping. He has abused the rule of law. He made the Predator the hallmark of his power. The cobweb imprisoned half the political system.  The heads of the armed forces even, journalists and businessmen. He was caught, as our people say, with a bug in his ear.  But his ear didn't sweat. He did, however, confess to the first tough question-something he knew and hadn't come to the debates for so long, what he wanted to come... In the first tough question he confessed, he testified that it was a big scandal, the wiretapping scandal, and that there were no national reasons for the wiretaps. And not only did he not feel the need to take responsibility, but he continues to organise the cover-up operation himself, with accomplices, of course, at the top of the judiciary.
