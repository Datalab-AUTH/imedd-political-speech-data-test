This Contract is our proposal for the programme of progressive government. Our proposal to all citizens, but especially to young people. Because young people have always been at the forefront of the battle in all the great conquests in our country for freedom, democracy, social justice and dignity. It was the young people who fought the struggle of the National Resistance. It was the young people who in '73 stepped in front of the crawlers. It was the young people who in '81 gave the message of change. It was the young people who gave the First Time Left in 2015. It is the young and young people who will give the message of victory and change the day after tomorrow by writing their own history. I want to say today that change is in their hands. It is in the hands of the young people. It depends on their vote. And I want to address the thousands of young people in our country, but especially the 450,000 young people who will vote for the first time this Sunday. And I want to ask myself, to ask them directly: Do you want to punish the Mitsotakis regime? Do you want to punish the way he has treated you at the desks, in the squares, in the workplace? Do you want to punish this system that crushes your dreams, your future, that makes you think about leaving the country you were born, raised and love?
