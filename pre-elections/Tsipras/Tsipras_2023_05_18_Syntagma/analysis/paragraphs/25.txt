Today we are asking the Greek people, with honesty and with an open heart, not for a second chance to govern, but for the first chance to govern on the basis of our programme, on the basis of what we want and not what we have to. Without memoranda, without coercion, without the Troika, without Sch√§uble, without all those who imposed their policies on us. History does not owe us. We owe History, we owe the Greek people. Let us show what a government of the left can be like under normal conditions. A progressive government.
