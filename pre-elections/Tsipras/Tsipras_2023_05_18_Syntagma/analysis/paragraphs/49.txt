Change for us is therefore not an all-weather slogan. It is not about changing the parties in power. Change for us, today, is a need, a desire, an expectation of the vast majority of our people. It is the desire of the many to change their lives. It is the need for change in the relationship between the citizen and the state. It is a state that, instead of standing beside the citizen, stands against him, a fearmonger. So it is concrete, measured, costed actions that give substance to our slogan of change and justice.
