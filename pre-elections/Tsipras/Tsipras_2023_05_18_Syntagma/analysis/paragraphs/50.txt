And do you want me to tell you in four sentences just what it means to vote for Syriza on Sunday and change, so that you can take these four sentences from house to house, from neighbourhood, from village to village, until we get to the ballot box? So this is what a vote for Syriza and Change means: It means a wage increase. Wages means wages. It means lower wages. And a fair, efficient, strong welfare state next to the citizen. That is what a vote for SYRIZA and Change means! This is our Contract. The Contract that we put before the citizens and we ask for their signature on the coming Sunday. So this Contract approves and mandates that whoever votes for SYRIZA on Sunday will be implemented.
