We stand before you with a clean face, clean hands, a clean heart, without a stain on our political record. Because we, under difficult circumstances, have fought the battle and brought the country out of the bankruptcy and memoranda that others have thrown it into. Because we managed the last euro of the Greek people with the greatest honesty and left behind us, in the public coffers, 37 billion euros as a dowry for Greece, a dowry of stability. Because we put the salvation of society and the salvation of the country above all else.
