We can make room for the education of our children. We can increase spending on education. We can open the doors of the universities to tens of thousands of children who are artificially left out by the long arm of Mr Mitsotakis and Mrs Kerameos with little basis for the clientele to go to colleges. Hire professors, double the number of professors in universities over four years. We are not hiring police officers, we are hiring professors in the universities. Police officers will go to the neighbourhood to fight crime, to fight the Greek Mafia, not to cooperate with the Greek Mafia.
