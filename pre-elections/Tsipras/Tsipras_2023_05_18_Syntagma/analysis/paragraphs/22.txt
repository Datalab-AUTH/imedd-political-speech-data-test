So there is no room for equidistance here. Because on Sunday there are two possible outcomes of the ballot box. Either SYRIZA comes first, which means justice, or New Democracy comes first, which means a cover-up. And I am sure of the decision of the vast majority of the progressive, democratic citizens of our country! It is a vote for SYRIZA, it is a vote for justice for all. It is a vote for SYRIZA, it is justice everywhere. Citizens of Athens, today I want to speak to you from the heart. Three days before a very big, crucial election. Today we stand before you and before the Greek people and we stand with our only weapon. Honesty. With the credentials of our political pedigree. With the credentials of our path. With Democracy, Justice, Change on our flags. That's the title on our flags: Justice Everywhere.
