We can finally change the state, the big patient. And only we can do it. Do you know why? Because we were not born with the conviction that this state is our property. We were not born princes in the great salons. We were born and raised with the conviction that the state belongs only to the people and must serve them. That is why we are the only ones who can reform the state. To restore rules, to establish transparency everywhere, to make room for accountability and dignity for public servants. Make room for honesty. And we will make it happen.
