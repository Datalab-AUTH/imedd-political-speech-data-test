Citizens of Athens, listen carefully to what I am about to tell you. Today it has become clear that change is now outside our doors. On Sunday, change is knocking at our door. Open it with your vote. Open the door to change! Open the door to hope!  Open the door to a better future for our country. And on Sunday night, meet me here at the Constitution of the Republic! Because the people will celebrate on Sunday night. And not the interests. They will celebrate the great victory of SYRIZA. The great victory of democracy, the great victory of justice! Hello! Good strength!  On Sunday, let's change the country! This is our history, the struggles for democracy, for the Constitution, for freedom, for dignity. On Sunday we rewrite history! Until Sunday, let's not lose a minute. House by house, neighborhood by neighborhood, we are making history. Goodbye!
