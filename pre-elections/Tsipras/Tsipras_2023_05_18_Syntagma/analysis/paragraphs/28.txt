So it is time to prove that we have both a plan and a vision and an obligation to work to give it a boost. That is our vision, our commitment. And I want to assure you: I am and we are as determined as ever to walk the path of justice. And we will not back down, no matter what obstacles stand in our way. We know that the path of justice is not a flowery one. Justice has enemies. There are interests that are wronged by Justice. We know that. But we have the will, the plan, the experience, the determination to put our will into action. Because now we do not only know, we have not only learned from our mistakes. We not only know, but now we know and we can. And with the support of the people, we can put a brake on the downward slide. We can put the country on a real trajectory of change and justice. To stand against lawlessness and vested interests and alongside the people and their right to dignity.
