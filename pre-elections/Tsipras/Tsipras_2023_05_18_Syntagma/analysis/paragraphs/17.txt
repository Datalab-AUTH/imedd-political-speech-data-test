I am not only referring to the fateful appointment that their staff state, partisanship, buffoonery, the dissolution of the OSE, indifference and inefficiency made in Tempe. I am not only referring to the attempted cover-up, the cowardice to blame it all on human error, namely the stationmaster whom they themselves appointed with a buffet. To the black theatre they put on with the minister showing off a rotten console and telling us that this is television broadcasting and with the Karamanlis of Tempe resigning, in consultation with the Prime Minister, only to come back a few days later as if nothing was wrong. Most importantly today, I want to refer to a great insult by Mr Mitsotakis to the relatives of the children who have been lost. His contempt for their mourning.
