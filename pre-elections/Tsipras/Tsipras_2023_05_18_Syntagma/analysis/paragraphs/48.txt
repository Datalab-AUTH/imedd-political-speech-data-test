Young people, citizens of Athens, have been accusing us lately because, he says, our slogans come from the past. And I want to say a few words about that. You know, we don't rehash the slogans of the past, but if slogans from the past, which belong to the legacy of the entire democratic and progressive Party, become relevant again today, do you know why? Because life, and especially the worst government that has been in power since the post-independence period, is making them topical.
