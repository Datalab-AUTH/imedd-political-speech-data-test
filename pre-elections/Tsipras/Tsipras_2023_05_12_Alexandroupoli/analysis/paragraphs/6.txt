These are the successes of the Mitsotakis government. And in the face of this policy, we say: there is another way, there is another perspective, there is the perspective of a programme and a plan, which we have submitted to the knowledge of the Greek people, so that everyone knows it when they go to vote, but we have also submitted it to the knowledge of all the progressive forces of the country. It is the contract of change that we presented for the next day, a contract of 11 articles, a contract with the people. And I will say briefly in just 4 axes what runs through this contract. Wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair, efficient, strong welfare state alongside the citizen. This is the fourfold principle of our policy.
