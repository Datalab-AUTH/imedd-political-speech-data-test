So I appeal to the democratic instinct of Greek citizens and Conservatives and I say don't give a blank cheque to a man, to a family that has turned governance into a public limited company, that has widened inequalities and dismantled the rule of law. We deserve, Greece deserves to become a normal European country. With justice. With a meritocratic state, with respect for the Constitution and democratic institutions, and we will achieve this together. We can achieve it together. All Greeks can take our country a little higher than the 22nd of May.
