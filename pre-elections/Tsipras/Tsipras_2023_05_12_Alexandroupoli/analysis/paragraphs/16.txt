We have also learned from our mistakes. We have made mistakes. We have made mistakes, it's true. But no one can claim that in these four and a half years, we have not governed the country with honesty. No one can say that. We are the only government since the post-independence period that has gone through the country and left the next generation 40 billion in the public coffers when it found them empty, and nobody can say that we left the next generation a mess. Nobody can say that. We took the country out of the memoranda. We got the country into the markets. We did. We regulated the public debt, we created a perspective so that each government can decide for itself, without the troika over its head. Mr Mitsotakis has left us in these four years with 50 billion more public debt, 40 billion more private debt and has increased the current account deficit tenfold.
