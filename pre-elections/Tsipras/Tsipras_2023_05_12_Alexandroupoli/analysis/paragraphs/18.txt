And we tell them we know that we have different, ideological, policies. But we understand that this particular government has put you to shame as well. With its precision and obscenity, with its inequalities, with its redistribution of wealth into the hands of the few and the powerful. With this wiretapping scandal, the shameful wiretapping scandal, to have the Prime Minister of the country become the high priest of wiretapping. To listen through his office to half of the political system, to the heads of the armed forces and not have the moral courage, as is the case in any other European country, to say no, just no: Sorry, wrong. To say 'I resign', as has been done everywhere in every other European country. Clinging to the chair of power and wondering if he gets a blank cheque for a second four-year term from the man who has dismantled half of the articles of the Constitution, what is in store for us in this country?
