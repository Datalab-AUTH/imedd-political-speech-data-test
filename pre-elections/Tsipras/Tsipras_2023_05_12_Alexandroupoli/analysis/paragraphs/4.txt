Have we moved forward and succeeded in tackling the energy crisis? To be the country with the most expensive electricity price in the whole of Europe, the most expensive price at the petrol pump in the whole of Europe, while we are competing with Bulgaria and Slovakia on wages and have the lowest per capita income? We have Bulgarian wages and London prices in supermarkets. A household cannot be left out. It's a nightmare in the supermarket. So have we done well and has this government succeeded in dealing with the inflationary crisis of price inflation, with a food inflation that is still today, a year, a year and a half after it spiked, still in double digits? Where exactly have we succeeded and what exactly have we achieved? But we are told that accuracy is imported. Yes, accuracy is imported, but obscenity is Greek and has the stamp of Mr Mitsotakis. Because at a time when the average household cannot or has difficulty paying for electricity, the energy companies are getting rich. At a time when the average household, in the third week of the month, is running out of money, 15 listed companies on the stock exchange have a 20-year record with profits of over a billion euros each. These are the successes of the Mitsotakis government. It has made the rich and powerful richer and stronger. But it has made the middle classes, poor and the poor, poorer, and this generalised injustice cannot continue.
