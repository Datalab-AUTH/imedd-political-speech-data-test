Do you remember what Mr Mitsotakis said 4 years ago to become Prime Minister? He promised the middle class support. Today the middle class is reduced to living on vouchers. Coupons for the supermarket, coupons for electricity, coupons for petrol. Do you remember what he used to promise pensioners? Better pensions he was promising. And what exactly happened? What exactly happened? What exactly? How do pensioners live today? He abolished the thirteenth pension introduced by Syriza as soon as we came out of the memoranda, then he said it was peanuts. But he abolished it. And he does not give the retroactive payments for the supplementary pensions and the bonuses, although he promised to give them, even though the decision of the Council of State came out. A total of 7 billion less for pensioners in the last four years. But that's not all he cut. So let's assume that the money and the pensions remained the same and the pensions in the pensioners' pockets. What is the value of a €600, €700 pension today and what was it worth 4 years ago? Let me answer you on the basis of official eurostat figures, which say that households with an income of up to €700 have lost 40% of their purchasing power in a year and a half. The €700 in 19 was 40% more valuable. They were potentially enabling an outsider to be able, with dignity, to get a gift for his grandchild. Today they do not even give him this opportunity of dignity, because he does not even have to pay the stream.
