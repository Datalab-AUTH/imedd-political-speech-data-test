Pictures by the fence are not enough. We need to reinforce and tear down other fences, because I will say it: we will not tear down the fence on the Evros. But we will tear down those fences that make your life difficult. The fences of inequalities, the fences that force you to live inferior to the people in the centre. You, the people of the constituency, the fences to access to universities, to public hospitals, to a strong and effective public health care system.
