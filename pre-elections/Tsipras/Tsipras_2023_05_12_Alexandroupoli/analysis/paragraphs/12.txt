The university. The university schools. With Mrs Kerameos's admission basis that denies entry to universities to 20,000 students a year. We see regional universities and many schools closing. In nursing, only 9 children passed last year in διδυμότειχo. The psychology department never opened. 9 new schools that the Democritus senate wanted to establish by decision were never established, because this is the decision of Mr Mitsotakis. Our children in colleges, not in public universities. But in colleges they do not ask for an admission basis. All they ask is that you have money to give. So that's why we are saying from these exams, we are removing the minimum admission basis so that 20,000 children, more children, will be able to get into higher education.
