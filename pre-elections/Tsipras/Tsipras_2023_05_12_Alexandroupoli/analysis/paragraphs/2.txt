Because it doesn't go any further. The Greek citizens cannot continue on this downhill slide, with no income coming in on the third week of the month. They cannot continue in this generalized injustice, inequality, obscenity. The country cannot be run by three families. We cannot continue with family rule. We cannot continue to see young children in this country with no prospect of living here with dignity and planning their future away from the place they loved, the place they were born. The place that raised them. These are the big issues that we want to put on the table and talk about in these few days left until the ballot box. Because we are told, Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy tell us, that Greece has moved forward in these four years, and we are asking ourselves in which area exactly has Greece moved forward? What are the successes of this government? Has it gone forward and has it managed to have successes in all the critical issues that this government has faced?
