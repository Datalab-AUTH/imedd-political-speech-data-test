But I want to say that the biggest threat to the next day is the one that has to do with middle class property. 700,000 properties have been taken over by the funds; 700,000 households are worried that their property will be taken away from them the next day, through auctions. So we say here today, addressing all the people of Evrica. We are not only addressing the left-wingers, nor only the centrists, but also the right-wing citizens, the householders, those whose lives are threatened by these thousands of auctions that will come like a tsunami to overwhelm the country.
