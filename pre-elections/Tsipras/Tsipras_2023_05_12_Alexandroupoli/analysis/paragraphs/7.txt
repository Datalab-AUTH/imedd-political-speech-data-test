A few days ago the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD, issued a report with its conclusions on the course of the European economies. A report which in fact trashes the whole narrative of the Mitsotakis government that promised better jobs and made workers work unpaid overtime. No more eight-hour days anywhere, abolished the labour inspectorate, no more standing by the worker to find their right. And of course they promised better jobs and better wages, right? That was one of the key promises, better wages. And then the OECD came along. And what does the OECD say? That Greece and the Mitsotakis government is the only government that in the last four years, because it's the only country that in the last four years not only, not only, I'm not talking about the minimum wage now, the average wage has been reduced. In the 3 years 19-21 it was the only country in Europe where we had a decrease in the average nominal wage. For 2022, despite the increases in the nominal wage, Greece was among the only 3 countries in Europe that had a 7.5% decrease in the average real wage. These are the results of the Mitsotakis government. These are the results that are irrefutable with figures, with numbers, with the stamp of international organisations. And of course, when he went on a television programme, he said: I refute the OECD. Of course, it is not in his interest to talk in terms of figures. He contradicts the OECD. He only wants to talk to Mr Avtia and Mr Portosalte. It is not just them that he does not deny, it is the international organisations that he denies. So we say deny what you want. The irrefutable criterion is the pocket of each and every one of us, of households, of working people and of working people. That is the irrefutable criterion. And there one need not be a leftist, a rightist or a centrist, because one understands, one understands one's own strengths, one understands how one lives, the difficulty of making ends meet.
