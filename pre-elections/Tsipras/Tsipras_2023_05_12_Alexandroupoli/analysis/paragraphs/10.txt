But I want to say, to say something more important, if you like. To say that the best defence for the border regions of our country, such as Evros, is development and the enhancement of the well-being of the people. And Evros has been abandoned these four years. Where are these programmes that we have managed to draw up in the face of great difficulties. The special infrastructure programme of EUR 26 million, with critical infrastructure projects for Evros, has been abandoned. Where is the plan that we jointly agreed with the Balkan leaders for the railway link between the ports of northern Greece and the ports of Bulgaria? That plan has been abandoned. Where are the projects that would have been carried out in the port of Alexandroupolis, with the sale of the port? The port was sold, we did not see any projects. Where is the project that we had signed for the environmental rehabilitation of the mine in Kirki, EUR 5 million. It would have brought jobs, jobs to the local economy. That was abandoned as well. A number of projects were abandoned.
