And today we see the government spokesman, Mr.Skertos, coming out and saying that a long-standing national claim, because our claims are not only against Turkey - a long-standing national claim, the claim for reparations from the period of the German occupation and the occupation loan is no longer a claim for our country. Whereas four years ago, SYRIZA had brought all the pieces together in Parliament and we signed a joint agreement that we would claim the German reparations, even if it was €1, as the late Manolis Glezos used to say, and even if it was €1, we have the right and the obligation to claim it. So here are the great nationalists, the easy ones who become sheep and vultures in the difficult ones. That is the reality. So I, from here, from Evros, want to address all Evrites and say that we will not allow anyone to think that citizens who vote for New Democracy are more patriotic than those who vote and are at the heart of the progressive and democratic party of our country.
