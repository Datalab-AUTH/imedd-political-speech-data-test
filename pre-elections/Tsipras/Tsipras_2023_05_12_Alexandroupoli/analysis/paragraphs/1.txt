Citizens of Alexandroupolis, thank you for this warm welcome. You have filled me with beautiful spring flowers, because spring is also coming in the political life of the country, and spring is also coming in our lives. On 21 May we will celebrate it. On May 21, the great, or long-awaited change that we expect in our lives will come, and that is the message I am getting, going from place to place these days, almost everywhere in our country, almost everywhere. Wherever I find myself, wherever I stand, this message that is being sent today and you are sending from here, from Evros, the message of change, is a message that is going through, permeating Greece and permeating the citizens, regardless of what they voted in previous elections. Because this is not a political slogan, it is a deep desire. It is not just about the need for change in government, it is about the need for a great change in our everyday life.
