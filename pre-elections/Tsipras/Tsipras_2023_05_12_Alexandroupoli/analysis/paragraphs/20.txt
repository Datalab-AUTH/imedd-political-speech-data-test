I want to thank you very much for your presence here today. And I want to assure you that the election battle will be a close one. There is a large percentage of citizens who will vote almost at the ballot box. That's why victory on election night will not be decided by newscast predictions. It will be decided by your work, by you. If you carry this message that our lives can be changed. The message of victory, the message of change, from village to village, from workplace to workplace. Then you can be sure, victory will come, change will become a reality. And above all, if the young people, the 450,000 first-time voters come to the polls, if they use the weapon they have where their vote is, then you can be sure: Not only will victory come. It will be a great victory. It will be a great victory for democracy. It will be a great victory for our people and it will bring justice more quickly everywhere. Be well. Thank you. Let's go with victory, bless you. Goodbye. Goodbye.
