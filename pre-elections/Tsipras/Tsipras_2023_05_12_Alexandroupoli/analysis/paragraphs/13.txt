To say more about your country, about Evros, to say more, yes. Hundreds of citizens in Evros are leaving every day, crossing the border to do cheaper shopping, to go to supermarkets in neighbouring countries. In Bulgaria and Turkey even, yes. To get cheaper petrol. Is this really the international and imported crisis? Is this the international accuracy? So why do hundreds of citizens here in Evros go to fill up their tanks in neighbouring countries and go to buy products in supermarkets in neighbouring countries? Shall I say more about the abandonment of Evros? Shall I say more? Services of the National Social Insurance Fund are being closed, merged. Bank branches are closing. Branches of the Post Office are closing. So this is the upgrading of the region?
