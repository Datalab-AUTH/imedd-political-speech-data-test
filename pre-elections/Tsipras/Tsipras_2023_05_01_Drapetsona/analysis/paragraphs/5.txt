But also in our country, in Greece, May Day is a milestone in the march of the workers' movement, the march of the ideas of social liberation and socialism. Nothing was conquered in this land, in this country without struggle and sacrifice. Struggles and sacrifices mark our May Days and give energy to this day to their liberating meaning. The murder of Paraskevaidis at the May Day celebrations in 1924, which was met with bayonets, the murder of Toussis and 11 others on the bloody May Day of '36 in Thessaloniki, which inspired Yannis Ritsos to create "Epitaph", the 200 executed in Kaisariani. This is our history. A history of struggles and sacrifices. But of course there were others who struggled and sacrificed in years of leisure, when words like "democracy", "social justice", "socialism" and even "trade unionism" meant persecution, exile and imprisonment, sometimes even death.
