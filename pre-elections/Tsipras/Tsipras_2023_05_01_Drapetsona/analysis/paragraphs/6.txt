This is our history, this is our legacy. That is why we say to all and to all: we come from far away and we will go far away. We are not a flare of the moment, we come from far away, we will go far away. We represent the struggles and sacrifices of our people for justice, freedom, democracy and progress. That is why we are the only ones who know and can bring change to this land.
