"Enough is enough" we say on May 21 and the next day dawns the hour of change, of justice, of progress. I invite you to this beautiful struggle and you can be sure we will win. Goodbye! Good power and have fun with the notes and songs of the struggle. For our struggles go hand in hand with optimism, hand in hand with song. We fight, we sing, we vote, we win.
