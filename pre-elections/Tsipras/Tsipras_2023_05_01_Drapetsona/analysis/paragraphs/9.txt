In our time, nothing can be taken for granted. Nothing can be taken for granted, especially when neoliberal capitalism challenges every right to work, every shred of dignity and security for the worker, every idea of even social justice. The current government, the Mitsotakis government, which is inspired by extreme neoliberal concepts and considers inequality to be a natural phenomenon, has even gone so far as to abolish the eight-hour working day as an institution. An iconic conquest for which rivers of blood have been shed, all over the world, not only in Greece.
8 hours of work.
8 hours of rest.
8 hours of leisure
These were the demands of workers' struggles and conquests a century ago.
