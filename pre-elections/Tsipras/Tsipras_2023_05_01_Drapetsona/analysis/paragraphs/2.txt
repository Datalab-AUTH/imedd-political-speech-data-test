I am very happy and proud that this area has become a place of respite, a place of recreation for thousands of citizens here in the districts of Piraeus, the popular districts of Piraeus. And it is a great pleasure, honour and pride for me to be here today, today being May Day. Because on May Day we don't go to flower shows. We honour the workers' struggles, we honour the people of labour on May Day. May Day is not a flower show, but a legacy of the struggles and sacrifices of working class, working people for justice and progress in this country.
