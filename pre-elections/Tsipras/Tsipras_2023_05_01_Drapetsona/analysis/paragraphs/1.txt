Hello friends, citizens of Drapetsona, Keratsini, all of Piraeus! It is a great pleasure to be here with you today and I would like to thank you for your great gathering today, for your very important presence and for your warm welcome. I would like to thank Tania, Fotis, the contributors to today's concert, which is dedicated to the Labour Day. In a place that means a lot to the people of Drapetsona and Keratsini and all of Piraeus. But it also means a lot to us, who have fought to keep this space from the clutches of speculative interests and to return it to the people.
