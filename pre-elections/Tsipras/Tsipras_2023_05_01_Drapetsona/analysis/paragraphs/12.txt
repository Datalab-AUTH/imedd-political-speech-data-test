We must give an answer in order to restore in this country the labour normality, the eight-hour working day, the collective agreements. For there to be an obligation on the employer to declare and pay overtime. Not to dismiss anyone without justification. To abolish the concept of agency work. To abolish uninsured work. Let the state stand by the worker when labour laws are not respected, with a strong Labour Inspectorate to be re-established. Because even this was abolished by the Mitsotakis government.
