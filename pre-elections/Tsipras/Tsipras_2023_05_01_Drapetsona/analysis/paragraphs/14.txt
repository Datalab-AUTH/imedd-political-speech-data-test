We call on all workers to unite their forces, their voice and their vote, not to give in to the blackmail and terrorism that remind us of dark times. We call on them to go to the polls en masse. They should also vote for the 250 000 seasonal workers, the 250 000 seasonal workers who will be on the islands and whom the Mitsotakis government has made sure are not given the opportunity to vote. Because if they voted, they knew they would be blackballed. Let us join forces. Let all workers across the country join forces and make this year's May 21 a day of celebration of the workers' May Day. This year we will celebrate Labour Day twice, on May Day and May 21. This message is addressed to all the people of labour, the people of work. To defeat blackmail, terrorism and create a day of hope the day after the elections.
