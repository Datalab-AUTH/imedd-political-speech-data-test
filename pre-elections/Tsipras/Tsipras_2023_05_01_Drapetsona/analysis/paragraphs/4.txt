Friends, citizens of Drapetsona and Keratsini, May Day is a day of remembrance and honour of the great labour struggles all over the world. Since bloody Chicago in 1886, May Day has marked the march of the working class, of wage labor, to win a place in the sun. It marks the difficult struggles of millions of people for social justice. It symbolizes the assault of the infernos of the earth on the sky of history.
