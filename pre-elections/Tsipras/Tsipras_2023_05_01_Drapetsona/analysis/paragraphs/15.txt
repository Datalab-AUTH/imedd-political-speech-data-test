We ask for your vote to come first and by a wide margin. A strong mandate to form a government of progressive cooperation. That's what we ask of working men and women across the country. To bring change, to bring security and dignity at work, in everyday life, a strong health care system that does not discriminate on the basis of class, an education without fences and barriers for the children of the people's districts, with the Minimum Admission Base.
