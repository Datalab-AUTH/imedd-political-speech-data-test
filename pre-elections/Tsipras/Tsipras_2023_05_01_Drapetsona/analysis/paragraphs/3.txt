That is why we choose to celebrate May Day here in Drapetsona. Because we cannot settle for the idea that "in Drapetsona we will no longer have life". In all the popular neighbourhoods of our country, we want to have life, not only in Kifissia, Ekali and Glyfada. Everywhere, all citizens should have life, the workers should have life. Workers to have life and rights, so that we can have all and sundry, so that all and sundry can have a job with dignity, wages with dignity, live with dignity. To have breathing and recreational spaces where they can be and spend their leisure time not locked up in the four showers. Yes, that is our policy, to give dignity and justice to all and sundry. "Justice everywhere". That is our message.
