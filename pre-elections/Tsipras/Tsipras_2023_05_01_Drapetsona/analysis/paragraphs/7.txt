But May Day is not only about history and memory. It is about what has happened, but also about what needs to happen, what needs to change. History and memory fuel today's struggles. I was reading the other day and thought it appropriate to remind you of what the resolution of the first workers' May Day, organised in 1893 by Stavros Kallergis' Socialist Association, said, among other things. 1893, 130 years ago! Among other things it said:
"On Sunday the shops should be closed all day long and the workers should rest.
Workers should work for 8 hours a day and minors should be prohibited from working.
A pension shall be granted to workers who are sick and disabled for the maintenance of themselves and their families.
