{"text_en": "Hello! Citizens of Lamia, thank you very much for this welcome, for your presence, for your overwhelming presence here today. You are giving the message of victory. In 15 days the nightmare will end. In 15 days, the much-needed change will come. SYRIZA wins the elections and the road opens for a government of progressive cooperation. I want to thank you warmly for your presence and your welcome. I want to thank you warmly for this overwhelming presence that gives the message of victory and change. Wherever I am all these days and I am every day and in a different corner of our country, the message is one, no more. This is it. That's it, with the denigration. Enough with the targeting. Enough with the indifference. Enough with the arrogance. So much for obscenity. So much for family rule. So much for injustice. It is time to bring justice back to this country and to give hope and perspective to the new generation, to the people of labour and creativity, to the middle class, to the people, the champions of work, who have been targeted over the years by their policies. And the truth is that for four years now, in everything that we have been through and we have gone through great difficulties, this government has failed.\n\nIt failed to manage the pandemic. We are the worst country in all of Europe in terms of deaths in proportion to our population. We had 37,000 casualties from the pandemic because our public hospitals were left without doctors and staff. We are at our worst. They failed to manage the pandemic.\n\nThey failed to manage the energy crisis. We are the country with the most expensive electricity price in the whole European Union. The country with the most expensive petrol.\n\nThey also failed to manage the crisis of price, the inflationary crisis. We have the highest prices in the supermarket, food inflation remains at 14%. They have failed in all the critical areas. They say accuracy is imported. But the truth is, and we all know it well, that accuracy may be imported, but obscenity is Greek. The obscenity has the signature of the Mitsotakis Government.\n\nFour years ago they promised the Greek people better days. You will all remember. Better jobs, better wages, better pensions and a staff state. I wonder where all that went 4 years later? The better jobs became jobs with unpaid overtime and the abolition of the statutory eight-hour period. The best wages became a reduction, disappearance of income from the third week of the month.\n\nAccording to eurostat data, households with an income of up to \u20ac700 have seen their purchasing power decline by 40%. \u20ac700 4 years ago was worth 40% more than it is today. But not only incomes up to \u20ac700. And that is the big crime. This is where the middle class, in whose name Mr Mitsotakis won the elections, has come to live on coupons, coupons to pay for electricity, coupons to go to the supermarket, coupons to pay for petrol. Everywhere there is a pass, but in the end you don't go anywhere with Mr Mitsotakis' pass.\n\nAccording to OECD data, Greece in 2022, in Greece in 2022, the average real wage not only did not increase, but decreased by 7.4%. These are the accomplishments of the Mitsotakis government, not to mention its accomplishments in relation to the erosion of the rule of law, the rules of democracy, the illegal surveillance, the information 108 that our country is sliding down and is an embarrassment to all of Europe. Not to mention direct awards and closed tenders. The blue golden boys, with their fat salaries, public agencies, direct commissions and closed tenders of 10 billion euros in the last year and a half. This is the picture of Greece in 2023, 4 years after Mr Mitsotakis took office.\n\nAnd the staff state has become the biggest joke. The executive state is a state that frightens citizens, a state that creates insecurity among citizens and you know, you are experiencing this very well here in Lamia, where you see how they have devalued your public hospital, a public hospital that is on the verge of collapse now. We left in 2015, we took over 76 doctors, we left 111. Today there are less than 100 in 2019 before the pandemic. There was, there were 7 pulmonologists. Today one in the hospital in Lamia. There were 6 pediatricians. Today one and one on a block at the Lamia hospital. There were 10 doctors in the emergency room. Today there are only 4 and we have had a pandemic and this pandemic that we have had was supposed to mobilise us, to strengthen rather than weaken the public health system, but this is Mitsotakis' policy.\n\nAnything public is left to be abandoned and devalued in order to feed private and big interests at the same time. Because the big issue we have to deal with is the widening inequalities and injustice that has become the norm in this country. And if some people, if some people forget, here comes Mr. Mitsotakis' policies. It means callousness, it means arrogance, it means not caring about ordinary everyday people, it means favouring big interests alone, because at a time when the vast majority of households see the supermarket as a nightmare and income running out in the third week of the month, 15 big companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange have a 20-year profitability record of over a billion in profits, each in 2022.\n\nThis is the reality today of great inequalities and I want to address today the pensioners who were promised that their pensions would be increased and were told that it was a pittance - the thirteenth pension that SYRIZA gave in conditions of fiscal austerity and cruelty. Where did this thirteenth pension go? They abolished it. Where are the retroactive payments to which they are entitled, which the Council of State decided to award them? They were never awarded. 7 billion euros have been taken away from pensioners by the abolition of the thirteenth pension and the retroactive payments that were not given in this four-year period.\n\nI would also like to address the rural world, the farmers and livestock farmers who are currently facing an existential dilemma, an existential issue. Whether they will continue to be in the countryside, whether they will continue to have herds and slaughter female animals, because they cannot afford the cost of production and farmers cannot afford the cost of production. How can anyone afford the price of electricity to produce, to stay in the countryside for the producer, when it has gone from 1,000 to 1,500 to 15,000? How can the farmer afford it, when the sack, the 25 kg of fertilizer from 18 \u20ac has gone to 60 \u20ac? How can the farmer bear it when he sees this huge difference between the price that the producer pays in the field and the price that the consumer finds on the shelf? 300 % difference, the largest in the whole of the European Union, again according to eurostat figures. This is the injustice, these are the inequalities, the great inequalities, to which the neoliberal policy of Mr Mitsotakis has led us.\n\nAnd I also want to address, to address young people, young people and young people. Because for four years now the Mitsotakis government has been targeting and disparaging young people. At the beginning we were told that they were even responsible for the spread of coronavirus. They put barriers to knowledge, to education, with the minimum basis for admission to universities, so that 20,000 fewer people a year would enter public universities. As a result regional schools, such as schools of the university that you have here in Lamia of the University of Thessaly, did not become the university of Central Greece, as we foresaw, and this was a decision of the Mitsotakis government. 20,000 fewer children a year, which means dozens of regional schools, at this moment in time, are on the verge of closure and face the risk of closure, but above all children from popular families who could not afford to pay for tutorials, to see their children unfairly cut off from an admissions base that has nothing to do with their opportunities to study at a public university.\n\nSo they targeted young people by putting barriers to knowledge. They have targeted them by creating inhuman working conditions. With unpaid overtime, with the regularity of flexible working, with the introduction of laws and regulations that put the power of impunity in the hands of the employer, especially towards young people. So what is coming today? Today, when young people are asking for the possibility of dreaming, when they are asking for a housing policy that gives them the right to live away from the family home, with the people they love, to have their own home that gives them the prospect of staying in the country and not leaving it and having decent jobs and access to knowledge. What is Mr Mitsotakis giving them today instead of the right to dream? 150 euros to those who turn 18.\n\nAnd this, this shows, this shows his panic, this shows his arrogance. This shows his contempt for young people. Many of you here will remember that Father Mitsotakis in 90-93. He was promising young people cars then, cheap cars, and there was a nice slogan at the time that said better a ducky than Mitsotakis. Today, today we have, we've gone lower, instead of cheap cars, he's giving them a million dollars to go open an expensive bottle of whiskey. They've now made prices more expensive, too, in some beachside centre. So that's why their answer, the 18-year-olds' answer at the ballot box will be better shot than Mitsotakis.\n\nCitizens of Lamia, things are serious, however, and they are serious, because this devaluation, this indifference, this contempt for young people, for the man of toil, for the man of work, can only pose great dangers for the future. And things are serious, because we have a crucial election ahead of us. An election in which there will be no second chance, as some people are suggesting. This election will decide who will govern. Have no doubt that if Mitsotakis wins, even by half a point, the next day he will not attempt to form a government in any way he can.\n\nLamia will show the way, as Lamia has shown the way in difficult times for the country, in difficult times for the country, and I for one am proud that we are in this square, under this statue. Because we know, we know and this is not to divide us this is to unite us. We know that we are free today because some gave their lives and fought against the conqueror and I am proud that these are our roots. The roots of the struggles of the national resistance, the roots of the struggles for freedom and democracy. The roots of the great social struggles for progress. I said that knowledge of our history is crucial and it is to unite us because I was very happy to visit your city about 2 months ago. I also visited your Metropolitan, Simeon, who gave me a surprise. He gave me a frame, which had Ares Velouchiotis and Pope Anymphonos together, they were walking hand in hand. The lay clergy were going hand in hand with the charioteers of that time, the rebels, the fighters who were defending the rights of our nation and our people.\n\nSo I close this parenthesis about Lamia, which will show us the way, and I return to everything I told you before. And I told you before that this election will be crucial, there will be no second chance. First of all, because the first and third parties will have the opportunity to form a government, and we are committed that if SYRIZA is the first party, it will form a government of progressive cooperation from the next day to get the country out of the social quagmire that has come today. If the new democracy is first, they will do everything, by legitimate and illegitimate means, by blackmail and pressure, even by what the Mitsotakis family knows, even by defections, to form a government. It will not take the risk of a run-off election. So that is why we are addressing all citizens today, not only progressive, democratic citizens, especially those, but every citizen, even conservative citizens who have disagreements with us. But they know and understand that what the country and they themselves need is a great change. To take a breath, to get rid of this regime that has been suffocating us for 4 years now that has shrunk income, shrunk rights, has made injustice the norm. That is the great stakes of the ballot box on May 21, May 21.\n\nBut Mr Mitsotakis has told us that what we are proposing has been costed, how much has he costed it? He cost 23. Then it went up, it went 45. Then it went to 83. He has until the 21st of this month to get to 183 in order to bully the Greek people. We answer him and say: We know what fiscal policy means, because we took the country out of the memoranda. It was his party that put the country into the memoranda, that left it bankrupt on 9 and 15 - a couple of times - when we received empty public funds and could not pay the pensions. We know what fiscal stability means much better than he does. Mr Mitsotakis, not just public finances. Because you know, we left a debt regulated, but it was 356 billion. Do you know how much it is now? 406. He increased in 4 years 50 billion in public debt he increased in 4 years 40 billion in private debt. And it also increased 10 times the current account deficit, which means, to put it plainly, that our imports are much more than almost twice as much as our exports. These are Mitsotakis's achievements in the economy. So where is their neatness and excellence? And of course, let me say the other thing: he took over a party with 180 million in bank debts and is now a party with 400 million in bank debts, borrowed and unpaid Greek taxpayers' money. So Mr Mitsotakis will not talk to us about costing. We know better what costing means.\n\nOf course, I have to admit that our policy will have a cost. It will have a cost because the 15 listed companies that have made a billion a year each will stop earning. It will have a cost to the funds that have taken 700 000 properties, the property of the middle class and the weak and want to sell them off and want to make 200 and 300 %. It will have a cost for them, it will have a cost for the powerful, it will have a cost for the big interests, for the energy companies, for the refining companies. Yes, they will stop making excess profits, but there will be no cost to the Greek people. On the contrary, the cost of the Mitsotakis policy that we have been living these four years is incalculable. By the way, what is the cost of the 37,000 deaths with the pandemic? What is the cost of the 57 lives that were unjustly lost in Tempe? How much does it cost, how much does the picture we saw yesterday cost? An 80-year-old disabled man in Halkidiki living outside his home because he was a guarantor on his unemployed son's loan. Really, how much does this reality we are living cost? Accuracy, obscenity, inequalities, privatisation, the fact that we have no public hospitals, how much does this policy cost?\n\nBut since the people do not forget. I want to address the progressive forces from Lamia today, because they too must remember and cannot say untruthful things that SYRIZA and its programme are the same as what New Democracy has been doing for four years now. Not only because we governed in the most difficult conditions and not with our programme, with the coercions of the Troika, but we put two and a half million uninsured citizens into the national health system. We have kept the national health system intact, we have supported the weak and the pensioners.\n\nBut not only because of that, but because our programme now is a programme that wants to give breath, hope and perspective to the world of work, to young people. It is unthinkable to bring back today what Plastira, what Papagos, which led us to years of hardship in those times and to the establishment of the most extreme right-wing regime in our country at that time. Just as it is unthinkable and incomprehensible to make a two-front struggle. We are not fighting a two-front struggle. We say to them, \"Come on, we submitted the 11-article change contract. Tell us which one you disagree with? Where are your disagreements, what do you want to add, and come back on the next election day and let's get the country out of this predicament that the worst right-wing government since the post-election period has put it in. Leave the bipartisanship and come and let us give this country and this people a breath of life and perspective.\n\nSo I want. So I want us, friends, citizens of Lamia, to realize that the battle of the May 21 elections is a crucial battle. This election may be a simple proportional representation election, but that does not mean that it will not be a simple logic election. Whoever comes first will be able to initiate developments to form a government. So that is why we say that the dilemma of the ballot box will ultimately be one. Do we change or do we continue to sink? Will we be able to breathe a sigh of relief with increases, wage increases, reductions in product prices, debt regulation and a fair and efficient welfare state, as proposed by the Syriza plan, or will we continue to sink in obscenity, inequality and injustice? So the dilemma of this ballot box is Mitsotakis again or change? Mitsotakis again or SYRIZA, a progressive alliance, and I am sure from your presence here and from your look, your confidence, I can see it, I am sure that the result has already been predetermined. The result in the dilemma I have posed will be a victory for SYRIZA, a victory for the people, a victory for democracy. I want us to ask ourselves. Do we want the cartels to be celebrating on the evening of May 21? The big interests? The powerful business groups? Or should the people celebrate, take to the streets and celebrate the great victory of democracy? And how will that happen?\n\nI am addressing the young people who will be voting for the first time. Many of them, and rightly so, feel that their vote should be a protest vote. They are right to do so. The first thing I say to them is that the crucial thing, whatever they vote for, is to go to the polls. Don't let go of that gun. Their marble is this. Don't leave it for others to manage. But I urge them to think. What will be that vote that will annoy the system and the establishment? Only the one that will hurt the system and the establishment? And which vote will hurt the system? The one that will lead to the defeat of the establishment's chosen ones. The one that will lead to the defeat of Mr Mitsotakis and the new democracy. So only a vote for SYRIZA can really create a serious problem for this establishment that has been ruling us all these years.\n\nAnd I invite all of you. In these elections, let us fight to create the conditions for a great and real change. All the previous years, the previous years that we governed from 15 to 19, you know that we governed under constraints. We did not implement our own programme. That is why I have said many times and I will say it again today. This is the first opportunity we are asking for to govern on the basis of our own programme. Now there will be no more Sch\u00e4uble for them to shout 'Vasta Sch\u00e4uble' and no more Geroun for them to say 'Yerun the Strong'. Now it will be us against history. And I believe that we owe it, not the people to us, we owe it to the people, to history and to Greece to leave behind us a country that will be a normal European country and not a country that will be a pariah of Europe.\n\nWhat can I say about the debate? He promised, okay, we have to be magnanimous and good-hearted. Be good-hearted. Mr. Mitsotakis will come to the ERT Radio House the day after tomorrow in a process of parallel monologues. He does not want us to have an open discussion, a substantive discussion. And he does not want to because he knows not that I do not underestimate my opponents, but because he knows that his political arguments cannot stand? He's learned to say good morning, don't be so mean to him. But he promised today that after the election he will come, he says in a debate with me. You know what? I have a feeling that won't happen either, because after the election, the New Republic will be the second party, and after the election, the organs in the New Republic will start. I may possibly debate with another leader, but with Mitsotakis, the two of us, I will not have the pleasure of debating. It wasn't meant to be, it seems.\n\nSo I want to conclude. I want to close by asking you in these two weeks to be the voice and the force that multiplies the message of change and the vote for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance. We, as you know, are a party that does not have the support of the powerful and the big media. But we do have the support of the ordinary people and that is much more important. It is multiplying this strength.\n\nSo I want to invite you to be the bearers of the message of hope, to be with the people, with your fellow citizens, with the workers, with the farmers, with the people of creation, to be with the young people. I see young people here with us today and it is very good to see that. 300 to 450,000 young voters are voting in this election. Believe me, if they go to the ballot box, there is not a single chance that the Mitsotakis regime that has ruled us for four years will win again. So I ask you to be the bearers of the message of change and victory. I call on you to fight together for the great victory in the elections of May 21 and for this great gathering to be a message. A message that will reach from end to end throughout Fthiotida. Because our goal in these elections of simple proportional representation is to elect 2 deputies with SYRIZA Progressive Alliance here in Fthiotida. 2 deputies to SYRIZA and the Left. I want to thank you warmly for this overwhelming presence and I want to commit myself to you. On the 22nd of this month, we will put into practice the hope and dream of a progressive government of cooperation that will implement a programme of economic recovery, support for society, wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair and effective state, strong, social, next to the citizen, as the citizen needs it. As society needs it. Be well, good strength and with victory. Thank you very much.

I want to thank you warmly for this overwhelming presence that gives the message of victory and change. Wherever I am all these days and I am every day and in a different corner of our country, the message is one, no more. This is it. That's it, with the denigration. Enough with the targeting. Enough with the indifference. Enough with the arrogance. So much for obscenity. So much for family rule. So much for injustice. It is time to bring justice back to this country and to give hope and perspective to the new generation, to the people of labour and creativity, to the middle class, to the people, the champions of work, who have been targeted over the years by their policies.

Because for four years now the Mitsotakis government has been targeting and disparaging young people. At the beginning we were told that they were even responsible for the spread of coronavirus. They put barriers to knowledge, to education, with the minimum basis for admission to universities, so that 20,000 fewer people a year would enter public universities. As a result regional schools, such as schools of the university that you have here in Lamia of the University of Thessaly, did not become the university of Central Greece, as we foresaw, and this was a decision of the Mitsotakis government. 20,000 fewer children a year, which means dozens of regional schools, at this moment in time, are on the verge of closure and face the risk of closure, but above all children from popular families who could not afford to pay for tutorials, to see their children unfairly cut off from an admissions base that has nothing to do with their opportunities to

everything I told you before. And I told you before that this election will be crucial, there will be no second chance. First of all, because the first and third parties will have the opportunity to form a government, and we are committed that if SYRIZA is the first party, it will form a government of progressive cooperation from the next day to get the country out of the social quagmire that has come today. If the new democracy is first, they will do everything, by legitimate and illegitimate means, by blackmail and pressure, even by what the Mitsotakis family knows, even by defections, to form a government. It will not take the risk of a run-off election. So that is why we are addressing all citizens today, not only progressive, democratic citizens, especially those, but every citizen, even conservative citizens who have disagreements with us. But they know and understand that what the country and they themselves need is a great change. To take a breath, to get rid of this regime that has been suffocating us for 4 years now that has shrunk income, shrunk rights, has made injustice the norm.

how much has he costed it? He cost 23. Then it went up, it went 45. Then it went to 83. He has until the 21st of this month to get to 183 in order to bully the Greek people. We answer him and say: We know what fiscal policy means, because we took the country out of the memoranda. It was his party that put the country into the memoranda, that left it bankrupt on 9 and 15 - a couple of times - when we received empty public funds and could not pay the pensions. We know what fiscal stability means much better than he does. Mr Mitsotakis, not just public finances. Because you know, we left a debt regulated, but it was 356 billion. Do you know how much it is now? 406. He increased in 4 years 50 billion in public debt he increased in 4 years 40 billion in private debt. And it also increased 10 times the current account deficit, which means, to put it plainly, that our imports are much more than almost twice as much as our exports. These are Mitsotakis's achievements in the economy. So where is their neatness and excellence? And of course, let me say the other thing: he took over a party with 180 million in bank debts and is now a party with 400 million in bank debts, borrowed and unpaid Greek taxpayers' money.

It will have a cost because the 15 listed companies that have made a billion a year each will stop earning. It will have a cost to the funds that have taken 700 000 properties, the property of the middle class and the weak and want to sell them off and want to make 200 and 300 %. It will have a cost for them, it will have a cost for the powerful, it will have a cost for the big interests, for the energy companies, for the refining companies. Yes, they will stop making excess profits, but there will be no cost to the Greek people. On the contrary, the cost of the Mitsotakis policy that we have been living these four years is incalculable. By the way, what is the cost of the 37,000 deaths with the pandemic? What is the cost of the 57 lives that were unjustly lost in Tempe? How much does it cost, how much does the picture we saw yesterday cost? An 80-year-old disabled man in Halkidiki living outside his home because he was a guarantor on his unemployed son's loan.

So I want us, friends, citizens of Lamia, to realize that the battle of the May 21 elections is a crucial battle. This election may be a simple proportional representation election, but that does not mean that it will not be a simple logic election. Whoever comes first will be able to initiate developments to form a government. So that is why we say that the dilemma of the ballot box will ultimately be one. Do we change or do we continue to sink? Will we be able to breathe a sigh of relief with increases, wage increases, reductions in product prices, debt regulation and a fair and efficient welfare state, as proposed by the Syriza plan, or will we continue to sink in obscenity, inequality and injustice? So the dilemma of this ballot box is Mitsotakis again or change? Mitsotakis again or SYRIZA, a progressive alliance, and I am sure from your presence here and from your look, your confidence, I can see it, I am sure that the result has already been predetermined. The result in the dilemma I have posed will be a victory for SYRIZA, a victory for the people, a victory for democracy. I want us to ask ourselves.

And he does not want to because he knows not that I do not underestimate my opponents, but because he knows that his political arguments cannot stand? He's learned to say good morning, don't be so mean to him. But he promised today that after the election he will come, he says in a debate with me. You know what? I have a feeling that won't happen either, because after the election, the New Republic will be the second party, and after the election, the organs in the New Republic will start. I may possibly debate with another leader, but with Mitsotakis, the two of us, I will not have the pleasure of debating.
