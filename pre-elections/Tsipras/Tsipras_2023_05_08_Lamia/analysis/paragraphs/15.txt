Citizens of Lamia, things are serious, however, and they are serious, because this devaluation, this indifference, this contempt for young people, for the man of toil, for the man of work, can only pose great dangers for the future. And things are serious, because we have a crucial election ahead of us. An election in which there will be no second chance, as some people are suggesting. This election will decide who will govern. Have no doubt that if Mitsotakis wins, even by half a point, the next day he will not attempt to form a government in any way he can.
