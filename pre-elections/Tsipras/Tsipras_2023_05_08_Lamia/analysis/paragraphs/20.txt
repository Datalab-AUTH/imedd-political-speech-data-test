But since the people do not forget. I want to address the progressive forces from Lamia today, because they too must remember and cannot say untruthful things that SYRIZA and its programme are the same as what New Democracy has been doing for four years now. Not only because we governed in the most difficult conditions and not with our programme, with the coercions of the Troika, but we put two and a half million uninsured citizens into the national health system. We have kept the national health system intact, we have supported the weak and the pensioners.
