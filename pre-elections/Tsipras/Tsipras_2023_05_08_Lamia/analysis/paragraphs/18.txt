But Mr Mitsotakis has told us that what we are proposing has been costed, how much has he costed it? He cost 23. Then it went up, it went 45. Then it went to 83. He has until the 21st of this month to get to 183 in order to bully the Greek people. We answer him and say: We know what fiscal policy means, because we took the country out of the memoranda. It was his party that put the country into the memoranda, that left it bankrupt on 9 and 15 - a couple of times - when we received empty public funds and could not pay the pensions. We know what fiscal stability means much better than he does. Mr Mitsotakis, not just public finances. Because you know, we left a debt regulated, but it was 356 billion. Do you know how much it is now? 406. He increased in 4 years 50 billion in public debt he increased in 4 years 40 billion in private debt. And it also increased 10 times the current account deficit, which means, to put it plainly, that our imports are much more than almost twice as much as our exports. These are Mitsotakis's achievements in the economy. So where is their neatness and excellence? And of course, let me say the other thing: he took over a party with 180 million in bank debts and is now a party with 400 million in bank debts, borrowed and unpaid Greek taxpayers' money. So Mr Mitsotakis will not talk to us about costing. We know better what costing means.
