I would also like to address the rural world, the farmers and livestock farmers who are currently facing an existential dilemma, an existential issue. Whether they will continue to be in the countryside, whether they will continue to have herds and slaughter female animals, because they cannot afford the cost of production and farmers cannot afford the cost of production. How can anyone afford the price of electricity to produce, to stay in the countryside for the producer, when it has gone from 1,000 to 1,500 to 15,000? How can the farmer afford it, when the sack, the 25 kg of fertilizer from 18 € has gone to 60 €? How can the farmer bear it when he sees this huge difference between the price that the producer pays in the field and the price that the consumer finds on the shelf? 300 % difference, the largest in the whole of the European Union, again according to eurostat figures. This is the injustice, these are the inequalities, the great inequalities, to which the neoliberal policy of Mr Mitsotakis has led us.
