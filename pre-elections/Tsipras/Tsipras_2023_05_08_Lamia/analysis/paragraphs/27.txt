So I want to invite you to be the bearers of the message of hope, to be with the people, with your fellow citizens, with the workers, with the farmers, with the people of creation, to be with the young people. I see young people here with us today and it is very good to see that. 300 to 450,000 young voters are voting in this election. Believe me, if they go to the ballot box, there is not a single chance that the Mitsotakis regime that has ruled us for four years will win again. So I ask you to be the bearers of the message of change and victory. I call on you to fight together for the great victory in the elections of May 21 and for this great gathering to be a message. A message that will reach from end to end throughout Fthiotida. Because our goal in these elections of simple proportional representation is to elect 2 deputies with SYRIZA Progressive Alliance here in Fthiotida. 2 deputies to SYRIZA and the Left. I want to thank you warmly for this overwhelming presence and I want to commit myself to you. On the 22nd of this month, we will put into practice the hope and dream of a progressive government of cooperation that will implement a programme of economic recovery, support for society, wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair and effective state, strong, social, next to the citizen, as the citizen needs it. As society needs it. Be well, good strength and with victory. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
