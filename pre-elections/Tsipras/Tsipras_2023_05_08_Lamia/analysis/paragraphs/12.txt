And I also want to address, to address young people, young people and young people. Because for four years now the Mitsotakis government has been targeting and disparaging young people. At the beginning we were told that they were even responsible for the spread of coronavirus. They put barriers to knowledge, to education, with the minimum basis for admission to universities, so that 20,000 fewer people a year would enter public universities. As a result regional schools, such as schools of the university that you have here in Lamia of the University of Thessaly, did not become the university of Central Greece, as we foresaw, and this was a decision of the Mitsotakis government. 20,000 fewer children a year, which means dozens of regional schools, at this moment in time, are on the verge of closure and face the risk of closure, but above all children from popular families who could not afford to pay for tutorials, to see their children unfairly cut off from an admissions base that has nothing to do with their opportunities to study at a public university.
