And the staff state has become the biggest joke. The executive state is a state that frightens citizens, a state that creates insecurity among citizens and you know, you are experiencing this very well here in Lamia, where you see how they have devalued your public hospital, a public hospital that is on the verge of collapse now. We left in 2015, we took over 76 doctors, we left 111. Today there are less than 100 in 2019 before the pandemic. There was, there were 7 pulmonologists. Today one in the hospital in Lamia. There were 6 pediatricians. Today one and one on a block at the Lamia hospital. There were 10 doctors in the emergency room. Today there are only 4 and we have had a pandemic and this pandemic that we have had was supposed to mobilise us, to strengthen rather than weaken the public health system, but this is Mitsotakis' policy.
