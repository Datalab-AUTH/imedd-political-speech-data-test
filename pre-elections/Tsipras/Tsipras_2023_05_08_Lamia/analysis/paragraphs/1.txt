Hello! Citizens of Lamia, thank you very much for this welcome, for your presence, for your overwhelming presence here today. You are giving the message of victory. In 15 days the nightmare will end. In 15 days, the much-needed change will come. SYRIZA wins the elections and the road opens for a government of progressive cooperation. I want to thank you warmly for your presence and your welcome. I want to thank you warmly for this overwhelming presence that gives the message of victory and change. Wherever I am all these days and I am every day and in a different corner of our country, the message is one, no more. This is it. That's it, with the denigration. Enough with the targeting. Enough with the indifference. Enough with the arrogance. So much for obscenity. So much for family rule. So much for injustice. It is time to bring justice back to this country and to give hope and perspective to the new generation, to the people of labour and creativity, to the middle class, to the people, the champions of work, who have been targeted over the years by their policies. And the truth is that for four years now, in everything that we have been through and we have gone through great difficulties, this government has failed.
