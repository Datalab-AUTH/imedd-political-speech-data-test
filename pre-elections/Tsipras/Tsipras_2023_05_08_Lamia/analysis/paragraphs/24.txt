And I invite all of you. In these elections, let us fight to create the conditions for a great and real change. All the previous years, the previous years that we governed from 15 to 19, you know that we governed under constraints. We did not implement our own programme. That is why I have said many times and I will say it again today. This is the first opportunity we are asking for to govern on the basis of our own programme. Now there will be no more Schäuble for them to shout 'Vasta Schäuble' and no more Geroun for them to say 'Yerun the Strong'. Now it will be us against history. And I believe that we owe it, not the people to us, we owe it to the people, to history and to Greece to leave behind us a country that will be a normal European country and not a country that will be a pariah of Europe.
