This is the reality today of great inequalities and I want to address today the pensioners who were promised that their pensions would be increased and were told that it was a pittance - the thirteenth pension that SYRIZA gave in conditions of fiscal austerity and cruelty. Where did this thirteenth pension go? They abolished it. Where are the retroactive payments to which they are entitled, which the Council of State decided to award them? They were never awarded. 7 billion euros have been taken away from pensioners by the abolition of the thirteenth pension and the retroactive payments that were not given in this four-year period.
