He was promising young people cars then, cheap cars, and there was a nice slogan at the time that said better a ducky than Mitsotakis. Today, today we have, we've gone lower, instead of cheap cars, he's giving them a million dollars to go open an expensive bottle of whiskey. They've now made prices more expensive, too, in some beachside centre. So that's why their answer, the 18-year-olds' answer at the ballot box will be better shot than Mitsotakis.
