Lamia will show the way, as Lamia has shown the way in difficult times for the country, in difficult times for the country, and I for one am proud that we are in this square, under this statue. Because we know, we know and this is not to divide us this is to unite us. We know that we are free today because some gave their lives and fought against the conqueror and I am proud that these are our roots. The roots of the struggles of the national resistance, the roots of the struggles for freedom and democracy. The roots of the great social struggles for progress. I said that knowledge of our history is crucial and it is to unite us because I was very happy to visit your city about 2 months ago. I also visited your Metropolitan, Simeon, who gave me a surprise. He gave me a frame, which had Ares Velouchiotis and Pope Anymphonos together, they were walking hand in hand. The lay clergy were going hand in hand with the charioteers of that time, the rebels, the fighters who were defending the rights of our nation and our people.
