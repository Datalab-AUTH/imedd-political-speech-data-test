Of course, I have to admit that our policy will have a cost. It will have a cost because the 15 listed companies that have made a billion a year each will stop earning. It will have a cost to the funds that have taken 700 000 properties, the property of the middle class and the weak and want to sell them off and want to make 200 and 300 %. It will have a cost for them, it will have a cost for the powerful, it will have a cost for the big interests, for the energy companies, for the refining companies. Yes, they will stop making excess profits, but there will be no cost to the Greek people. On the contrary, the cost of the Mitsotakis policy that we have been living these four years is incalculable. By the way, what is the cost of the 37,000 deaths with the pandemic? What is the cost of the 57 lives that were unjustly lost in Tempe? How much does it cost, how much does the picture we saw yesterday cost? An 80-year-old disabled man in Halkidiki living outside his home because he was a guarantor on his unemployed son's loan. Really, how much does this reality we are living cost? Accuracy, obscenity, inequalities, privatisation, the fact that we have no public hospitals, how much does this policy cost?
