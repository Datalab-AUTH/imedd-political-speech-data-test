What can I say about the debate? He promised, okay, we have to be magnanimous and good-hearted. Be good-hearted. Mr. Mitsotakis will come to the ERT Radio House the day after tomorrow in a process of parallel monologues. He does not want us to have an open discussion, a substantive discussion. And he does not want to because he knows not that I do not underestimate my opponents, but because he knows that his political arguments cannot stand? He's learned to say good morning, don't be so mean to him. But he promised today that after the election he will come, he says in a debate with me. You know what? I have a feeling that won't happen either, because after the election, the New Republic will be the second party, and after the election, the organs in the New Republic will start. I may possibly debate with another leader, but with Mitsotakis, the two of us, I will not have the pleasure of debating. It wasn't meant to be, it seems.
