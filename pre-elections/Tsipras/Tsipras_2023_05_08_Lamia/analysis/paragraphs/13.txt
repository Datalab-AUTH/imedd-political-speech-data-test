So they targeted young people by putting barriers to knowledge. They have targeted them by creating inhuman working conditions. With unpaid overtime, with the regularity of flexible working, with the introduction of laws and regulations that put the power of impunity in the hands of the employer, especially towards young people. So what is coming today? Today, when young people are asking for the possibility of dreaming, when they are asking for a housing policy that gives them the right to live away from the family home, with the people they love, to have their own home that gives them the prospect of staying in the country and not leaving it and having decent jobs and access to knowledge. What is Mr Mitsotakis giving them today instead of the right to dream? 150 euros to those who turn 18.
