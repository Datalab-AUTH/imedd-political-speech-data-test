Four years ago they promised the Greek people better days. You will all remember. Better jobs, better wages, better pensions and a staff state. I wonder where all that went 4 years later? The better jobs became jobs with unpaid overtime and the abolition of the statutory eight-hour period. The best wages became a reduction, disappearance of income from the third week of the month.
