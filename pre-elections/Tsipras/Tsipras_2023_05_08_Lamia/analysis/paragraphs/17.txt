So I close this parenthesis about Lamia, which will show us the way, and I return to everything I told you before. And I told you before that this election will be crucial, there will be no second chance. First of all, because the first and third parties will have the opportunity to form a government, and we are committed that if SYRIZA is the first party, it will form a government of progressive cooperation from the next day to get the country out of the social quagmire that has come today. If the new democracy is first, they will do everything, by legitimate and illegitimate means, by blackmail and pressure, even by what the Mitsotakis family knows, even by defections, to form a government. It will not take the risk of a run-off election. So that is why we are addressing all citizens today, not only progressive, democratic citizens, especially those, but every citizen, even conservative citizens who have disagreements with us. But they know and understand that what the country and they themselves need is a great change. To take a breath, to get rid of this regime that has been suffocating us for 4 years now that has shrunk income, shrunk rights, has made injustice the norm. That is the great stakes of the ballot box on May 21, May 21.
