According to eurostat data, households with an income of up to €700 have seen their purchasing power decline by 40%. €700 4 years ago was worth 40% more than it is today. But not only incomes up to €700. And that is the big crime. This is where the middle class, in whose name Mr Mitsotakis won the elections, has come to live on coupons, coupons to pay for electricity, coupons to go to the supermarket, coupons to pay for petrol. Everywhere there is a pass, but in the end you don't go anywhere with Mr Mitsotakis' pass.
