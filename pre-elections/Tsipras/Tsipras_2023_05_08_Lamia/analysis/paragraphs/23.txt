I am addressing the young people who will be voting for the first time. Many of them, and rightly so, feel that their vote should be a protest vote. They are right to do so. The first thing I say to them is that the crucial thing, whatever they vote for, is to go to the polls. Don't let go of that gun. Their marble is this. Don't leave it for others to manage. But I urge them to think. What will be that vote that will annoy the system and the establishment? Only the one that will hurt the system and the establishment? And which vote will hurt the system? The one that will lead to the defeat of the establishment's chosen ones. The one that will lead to the defeat of Mr Mitsotakis and the new democracy. So only a vote for SYRIZA can really create a serious problem for this establishment that has been ruling us all these years.
