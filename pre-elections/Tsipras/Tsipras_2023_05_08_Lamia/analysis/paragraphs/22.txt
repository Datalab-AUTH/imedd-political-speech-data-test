So I want. So I want us, friends, citizens of Lamia, to realize that the battle of the May 21 elections is a crucial battle. This election may be a simple proportional representation election, but that does not mean that it will not be a simple logic election. Whoever comes first will be able to initiate developments to form a government. So that is why we say that the dilemma of the ballot box will ultimately be one. Do we change or do we continue to sink? Will we be able to breathe a sigh of relief with increases, wage increases, reductions in product prices, debt regulation and a fair and efficient welfare state, as proposed by the Syriza plan, or will we continue to sink in obscenity, inequality and injustice? So the dilemma of this ballot box is Mitsotakis again or change? Mitsotakis again or SYRIZA, a progressive alliance, and I am sure from your presence here and from your look, your confidence, I can see it, I am sure that the result has already been predetermined. The result in the dilemma I have posed will be a victory for SYRIZA, a victory for the people, a victory for democracy. I want us to ask ourselves. Do we want the cartels to be celebrating on the evening of May 21? The big interests? The powerful business groups? Or should the people celebrate, take to the streets and celebrate the great victory of democracy? And how will that happen?
