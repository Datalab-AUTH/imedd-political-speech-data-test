But not only because of that, but because our programme now is a programme that wants to give breath, hope and perspective to the world of work, to young people. It is unthinkable to bring back today what Plastira, what Papagos, which led us to years of hardship in those times and to the establishment of the most extreme right-wing regime in our country at that time. Just as it is unthinkable and incomprehensible to make a two-front struggle. We are not fighting a two-front struggle. We say to them, "Come on, we submitted the 11-article change contract. Tell us which one you disagree with? Where are your disagreements, what do you want to add, and come back on the next election day and let's get the country out of this predicament that the worst right-wing government since the post-election period has put it in. Leave the bipartisanship and come and let us give this country and this people a breath of life and perspective.
