So I want to conclude. I want to close by asking you in these two weeks to be the voice and the force that multiplies the message of change and the vote for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance. We, as you know, are a party that does not have the support of the powerful and the big media. But we do have the support of the ordinary people and that is much more important. It is multiplying this strength.
