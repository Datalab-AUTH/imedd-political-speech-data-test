Mr Mitsotakis, of course, has created a virtual reality.  With the help of his communication sponsors, with the millions of state money from the Petsas list that created "Update 108" - we have now gone up to 107, we have gone up a little bit, it's true, because some other third world country has fallen, we are 107th on the list, one of the worst in the world in terms of pluralism and democracy in information. So create a virtual reality. And I listen to him too many times talking about his achievements and I feel like I'm living in another country, or that he thinks he's running another country. A fantasy land, something like Alice in Wonderland. But the reality is the opposite. It's not Alice in Wonderland, but Kyriakos in Trauma Land. Of the many wounds that this society and this country has on its body. Of the wounds that he himself caused. Let me list some of these wounds.
