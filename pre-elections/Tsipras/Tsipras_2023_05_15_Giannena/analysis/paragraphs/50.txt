And especially the participation of young people. So today I want to call on all of you, especially young people, to go to the polls en masse next Sunday, to throw their predictions into the bucket and send home the most arrogant prime minister and the worst government the country has seen since the post-war period. So let's go to the ballot box for victory! Let's go to the ballot box for change! All together! We can! For a Greece with more light! On May 21, the people will win! Democracy will win! The sun of justice will rise again over our country. In six days, the time will come for the people to make history. So let us also write the 21st of May 23 in history, as the day of our, your, young and old, Change. For the return of democracy to power and justice everywhere! Friends and friends, citizens of Ioannina, let us go firmly to the ballot box. To end the four years of suffering and trauma. Change and justice are now at our doorstep. Open the door with your vote and don't miss a minute with your work, home by home, village by village, man by man, until Sunday. That's how we will win. And not just win, it will be a great victory that will go down in history. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this overwhelming presence today, for this great gathering, for this message of victory that you have given! Goodbye! Thank you very much! Let's get going!
