Second trauma: It leaves behind a broken NHS, without sufficient medical and nursing staff. The negative record of 37,000 of our fellow human beings lost in the pandemic ranks our country in the worst position in the whole western world, even worse than Bolsonaro's Brazil, in proportion to our population. Why has this happened? Why, instead of reinforcing our hospitals with doctors and nurses, instead of building ICUs, what was he telling us? He was lying to us that he supposedly did not know if there are studies that say the obvious, that when a person is intubated outside of ICUs, they obviously do not have the same chance of being saved as someone who is intubated inside. And he was telling these lies unabashedly, when he had all the studies and there was common sense.
