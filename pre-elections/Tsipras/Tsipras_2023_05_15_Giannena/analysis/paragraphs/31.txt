In this battle, friends, we are going down with open cards and with a clear vision and with the flag of the Contract for Change that we submitted to the judgment of the Greek citizens, a few days ago, with 11 articles. And to the judgment of all the progressive forces, so that they cannot say things that are untrue. Like that the programme of Syriza and New Democracy is the same. Really? Is this program that they put into practice, that abolished the eight-hour work week, introduced unpaid overtime, abolished the SEPA, and have the worker in a jungle, the same as our program that restores all this?
Is it the same to have public hospitals broken, doctors leaving, with this program that allows them to get 2,000 salary for the first appointed doctor? Is it the same to deny the 13th pension to the retiree with our program that restores it, that gives the retroactive pension?
So I ask myself: what is the meaning of our vote this coming Sunday if it is not what will dawn on us on Monday? Anyone who refuses to give an answer by saying the untruths that we know where our Movement and our democracy led in the old days, of the type 'what a Plastiras what a Papagos', must give answers to the progressive and democratic citizens, now and on the day after the elections.
