At this point, my dear compatriots, I would like to say a few words about our common homeland, Epirus. As an Epirus myself, I grew up reading and listening to this disappointing phrase, that Epirus is one of the poor and underdeveloped regions of Europe. And when life brought it about and I took on the responsibility of Prime Minister, I had the concern and the vision to do everything in my power to ensure that this phrase ceased to haunt future generations of Epirus. The truth is that we governed in the most difficult circumstances, but I believe that we made many steps for the whole of Western Greece and for Epirus. We put a lot of emphasis on infrastructure, with the Olympia Odos and Ionia Odos being the main ones, which opened up roads for Western Greece and put it back on the map as a region.
