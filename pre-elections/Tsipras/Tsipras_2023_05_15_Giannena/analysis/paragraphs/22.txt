And the question is:  If there was no national reason, why, Mr Mitsotakis, why did you invoke national secrecy for nine months to cover up the truth in the Commission of Inquiry? And I wonder, since there was no national reason, why Mrs Vlachou, the prosecutor of the NSA, signed all these provisions to monitor half the political system - political leaders, ministers, even the heads of the armed forces - and no one has asked for an explanation from this prosecutor, who told us that if she were to judge for herself, she would even monitor the President of the Republic. What I am describing to you is not exactly the right, it is a regime. The worst the country has seen since the post-war period. It's not exactly the right that I'm describing to you. It is the Mitsotakis regime. And I ask myself, because this is the crux of the surveillance: where has all that has been recorded gone? Where have the transcripts of the surveillance of half the political system and half the economic system, half the business world, gone? Does Mr Mitsotakis have them on tapes in his drawer to blackmail half the political system and half the business world for the next twenty years? That is the big question. And for that, indeed, those responsible must be held accountable, starting with the Prime Minister who orchestrated this squalor.
