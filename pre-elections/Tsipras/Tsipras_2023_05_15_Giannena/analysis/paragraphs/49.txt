The result of these elections - listen to what I'm going to tell you - the result of these elections will not be decided by polls, but by the vote of the Greek people. Look at the results of the polls. A few weeks ago in Cyprus, they were off. Yesterday in Turkey, they were out. Why did this happen? What was it that threw the predictions and the measurements into the bucket? It was one thing: The turnout at the ballot box.
