It leaves us with a fifth trauma, which you have all experienced: The plundering of income, the collapse of the average wage and the purchasing power of households. The irrefutable witness is the data provided by the international organisations. What has Eurostat told us? That in Greece, in recent years, a household with a monthly income of up to EUR 700 has lost 40% of its purchasing power. In other words, the salary it received two years ago was 40% more valuable. What did the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, tell us the other day? It told us that Mr Mitsotakis's Greece was the only European country, the only one, in the three years 2019-2021, where there was a decrease in the average nominal wage and one of only three in Europe that in 2022, there was a decrease in the average real wage. What this means, what all this means: That where we were promised better jobs, better wages and support for the middle class, they have led the middle class to live on food stamps. Vouchers for the supermarket, vouchers for the electricity bill, vouchers for petrol stations. And they cut wages, they cut purchasing power, they dismantled labor.
