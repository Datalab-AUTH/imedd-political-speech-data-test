Our goal is also to protect the natural environment, this unique wealth in Epirus and Ioannina. And in this direction, a central role for us is the reactivation of an emblematic, in my opinion, reform that we made in '18, the reform of the energy communities, which was frozen by the government of the New Democracy. No investment in order to have interconnectivity, to strengthen the network. And what little space there was in the grid went only to the big business groups, whereas the reform of the energy communities is mainly for small communities. The farmer and the farmer should be able to become a self-producer and self-consumer of the electricity he produces. Rural cooperatives, local government, villages, can be set up to do this. And of course small and medium enterprises. The Mitsotakis government did not do this, it left everything to the big groups. So we aim to invest in the network and give this reform a perspective, to revitalise it. And we commit that at least 50% of the new Renewable Energy licenses will be given to small businesses, to Cooperatives, Farmers' and Ranchers' Cooperatives, to self-production and not to big business groups.
