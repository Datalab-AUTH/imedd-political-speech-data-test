So it is a closed stadium, to accommodate your optimism, to accommodate the message of victory and change that Giannina is giving today! It is the best, the truest show of victory, your gathering today! It gives the message of victory! The prefecture of Ioannina and the whole of Epirus will give the SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance a first place in six days from today!  Six days left, citizens of Ioannina. Five and one, as we used to say in the old days in the Army. Five and one for the great Change! Five and one for the great victory! It is a message of reversal that you are giving today. On Sunday the lies end. Greece is turning the page. Days of justice, days of democracy, days of meritocracy are dawning. The days of the people are dawning again. This is the message, I assure you, that I take to every corner of our country and to every rally, in every city, from Alexandroupolis to Crete, from Corfu to the Dodecanese. Every rally is proof of victory.  The best show of victory is our contact with the people. Because we are always in the world. Today we were spoiled by the weather, because if we hadn't had a rainfall report, we would have had a rain of people in your big square here in Ioannina and we can't fit in this closed gym, it's full inside and outside. But in every meeting we have, it is clear that on the coming Sunday we are going for a great victory for democracy, a great victory for the people.
