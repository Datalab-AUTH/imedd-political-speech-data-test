Ladies and gentlemen of Giannina, I have tried to give you a brief overview of our basic programmatic commitments and goals for society, for the economy, for Epirus, for Giannina. I would like to close this meeting by saying two things from the heart. Our meeting today was a very large meeting. And it is a message. A message that in Ioannina the outcome has been decided. SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance on Sunday will be first! It will be first and by far! But I think that both yesterday's rally in Agrinio and your rally here in Giannina today are a message of victory for the whole of Greece. It is a victory performance! Today Epiros has spoken. The message of Change is already resounding from city to city, from village to village. From Tzoumerka to Zagoria, the message of victory and Change is resounding!
