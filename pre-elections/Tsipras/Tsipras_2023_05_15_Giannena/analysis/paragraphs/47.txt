Finally, there is an urgent need to review the new CAP, with the aim of supporting primary production. But even more necessary, and I want to commit myself before you today, is the redirection of the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund. And I want to make this clear: The resources of the Fund will be redesigned, redirected to support the Region, to fight inequalities and to address demographic shrinkage. We have already studied the plan. And let me tell you that we are also in advanced discussions in Europe. From Monday, the continent is back on the map of funding for recovery and cohesion. It is back on the map of the Recovery Fund resources. So that we do not miss another great opportunity, so that we do not let it go to waste. And we will not let it go to waste.
