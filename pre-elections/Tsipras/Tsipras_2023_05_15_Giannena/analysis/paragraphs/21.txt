And I come to the 7th trauma - I've lost count, there are many more, I've listed some to tell you today. I am coming to the 7th trauma and perhaps the deeper one, because it concerns the abuse of democracy, the rape of the rule of law in our country. You will recall that Mr Mitsotakis has all this time, even today, refused, avoided and avoided like the devil, to stand opposite me on a television station and discuss with me calmly and simply. But in front of the cameras, in real time, so that the Greek people understand our positions, so that we can refute arguments. He didn't dare. His appearance the day before yesterday, a week before, in the debate, probably proved that he rightly did not want to. It was not just the two of us, of course, he had four others, he thought he would hide behind them, but he lost it in the first tough question. And he testified, as they say, without a beating. Told what? He testified to what he'd been trying so hard to hide for nine months. The illegal wiretapping scandal. He called it a "scandal" and at the same time admitted that there was no national reason for these wiretaps.
