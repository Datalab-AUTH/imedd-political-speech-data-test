Our programme is not only costed, but we have been in open line for two years with all social groups to draw it up. With the input of top experts, really excellent experts. Excellent in their dedication to science and to the interests of the many. And it's the program I presented two weeks ago to Chancellor Scholz. But for Scholz it was feasible, for Mitsotakis it will lead us into memoranda, it is a disaster. He said the same thing four years ago, remember, when we were taking the country out of the memoranda, he said without shame that we signed the fourth one. From this 4th, he found and gave more than 60 billion over the whole of the previous period to day labourers. But I think he is saying this because he thinks that the Greeks have a short memory, a goldfish memory. The goldfish is said to have no memory. It thinks we have forgotten which party left the country with a 15% deficit in 2009 and threw us deep into memoranda and deep into bankruptcy. And which party left empty coffers in '15. But the thief cries out to scare the landlord. I want to assure you, friends, the landlord is not afraid. Our programme will be implemented. It will come at a cost to some powerful people, but we will implement it. We will implement it to the hilt!
