So our programme, apart from the 11 articles, I will tell you very briefly, so that by Sunday you can talk to people and tell them what it means to vote for Syriza. A vote for SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance means four things: Wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation, and a fair, efficient, strong welfare state alongside the citizen. That is what a vote for SYRIZA means! This is what a SYRIZA victory next Sunday will mean! For those who are suspicious, I want to say: In addition to the 11 articles program, we have already prepared the first legislative act, because justice will come in force, starting on Monday. And we need to speed it up even more, before Parliament is even constituted.
