I don't know if you saw a few days ago, a week ago, ten days ago, a video that proves how scared all those people who ate with golden spoons are. Because they can't say they gave 60 billion, but no one in society says it was enhanced, that went somewhere. I don't know if you saw how scared they are in this video, where there was an employer threatening his workers that if they vote for Syriza he will fire them, next to the gleeful Minister of Development! That's how scared they are. Because indeed, our program will come at a cost to some. And of course watching this video, one wonders: We haven't seen this much democracy in our country since the 1950s, that's where the Mitsotakis regime turned us.
