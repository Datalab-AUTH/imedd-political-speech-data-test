But at this point I also want to address conservative citizens, conservative voters. To the voters of New Democracy. We have important ideological differences, but I do not believe that the majority of these voters want this scandal to be covered up. I do not believe that the majority of these voters want the arbitrariness from the abuse of democracy to corruption. And my question is: Mr. Mitsotakis is calling on you with your vote to wash him out. Will you wash him out? Will you knowingly become his accomplices? Are you going to tell him? Will you be his accomplices? New Democracy is a large party, we have ideological differences, but we respect them. He has offered the country. And we criticize what it failed to do or what many of the things it did put in place. But what, really, does factionalism and Maximou SA, as the late Fofi Gennimata said, have to do with the tradition of the conservative party? Costas Karamanlis, the former prime minister, once called the interconnectedness "pimps". He did not put them in his living room as Mitsotakis did. So these people today are not New Democracy, they are Old Anaxocracy and not New Democracy. They are Holy Family and not a New Democracy party. So I want to address the conservative voters here in Ioannina and ask them to think once and for all whether they will be complicit. Because it is not worth it for their party either, but above all it is not worth it for this country to give a free pass for another four years to arrogance, corruption and injustice. It is not worth it in our country.
