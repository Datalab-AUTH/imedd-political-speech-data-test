I will tell you who our programme will cost. Our programme will be very costly for the energy cartels, for those who Mr Mitsotakis keeps VAT high to fill the public coffers with money, plundering the middle classes and the weak, everyone, to keep prices high. Because up there the subsidies do not go into the pockets of the citizen, the various passes. The energy cartels, the food cartels, the refinery cartels, the country is full of cartels. For them, yes, there will be a cost. For whom else will it come at a cost? It will come at a cost to the funds, who have been promised that by buying the loans at 25% of the value, they will get 100% back. And they are now preparing to auction off 700,000 homes. Yes, there will be a cost to our program for the funds, they won't be profiting. And it will certainly come at a great cost to all those day laborers, the companies that were set up a few days ago for the closed bidding.
