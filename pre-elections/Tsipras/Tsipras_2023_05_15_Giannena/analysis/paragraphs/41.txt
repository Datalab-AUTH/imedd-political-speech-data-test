Our plan also includes the substantial strengthening and upgrading of both the University Hospital and the Hadjikosta Hospital. The strengthening and establishment of new Local Health Units, because we will double them throughout Greece, and new Health Centres. Why? Because we have set a vision and a national goal to build a strong and qualitative NHS. If we have to have a national goal, it is to become Europe, not just to stay in Europe. To bring health spending to where the European average is. To catch up with other European countries. And that means boosting public spending on the NHS. To build a new, reliable, accessible National Health System for all Greeks. This of course requires a pay scale for doctors. That is why we are saying EUR 2 000 as the starting salary for the first-time doctor. Because otherwise he will not stay in the NHS, he will go to other countries. Our country is losing the most brilliant minds, we have filled Greek doctors in all European countries. This has to stop. Yes, that is what investment in the future, investment in the NHS means. That is our vision, that is our plan. And we will put it into practice. By also strengthening the infrastructure, but also by making permanent all the people who fought the battle on the front line at the time of the pandemic. It is our moral duty. I am talking about the auxiliary doctors, I am talking about the contract nurses. All these people must be rewarded for the great effort they made during the pandemic.
