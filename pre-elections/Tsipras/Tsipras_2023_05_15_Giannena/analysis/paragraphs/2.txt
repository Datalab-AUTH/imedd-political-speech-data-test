Why? Because the vast majority of Greek society, the vast majority of ordinary people, say one thing, feel one thing and put out one thing, two words: Enough! That's it, no more! No more arrogance! No more indifference! No more of this unworthiness! No more of family rule! No more inequality! No more generalized injustice! And in case some younger people have forgotten, the worst government of the Right since the post-communist era, the government of Mr Mitsotakis, has come to remind us what exactly the Right means. Mr Mitsotakis is telling us, friends, that Greeks want to go forward, not back. Do you know something? I agree with him, he is right. Only instead of telling the Greeks, he should tell them every morning in his mirror that the country should go forward and not go backwards. Because he is the man who took over a country that, after great adventures, had regained stability outside the memoranda. With its debt settled, its coffers full, its society on its feet and a strong outlook for its economy. And of course, all this happened because we governed with integrity in the most difficult moments of our recent history. And we managed to make the sacrifices of the Greek people pay off. And what has Mr Mitsotakis done for four years now? He pulled the handbrake with both hands and turned around. He has taken us back to dark times, to a country where workers work unpaid 12-hour days, to a country that has come to have Bulgarian wages and British prices. Because that is what is happening in Greece today.
