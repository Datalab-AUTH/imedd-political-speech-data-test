The worst thing that has happened to us as a country is that we are getting older. And the worst thing, even worse, is that young people cannot dream of a better future. We are obliged to work to build a better future for the younger generation of this country. Always in this country, all great historical events have been determined by young people. Young people have always come first. This was the case in '73 for the overthrow of the junta and the Metapolition. So it was in '81 with the Change. It was the same in '15, with the great victory of SYRIZA. So it will happen next Sunday! The young people and the young people will decide the election results! The young people will bring this great victory for our people, the great victory for Greece. The young and the young. 450,000 young voters will go to the polls. If they go to vote, there will be no time for Mr Mitsotakis to pack up the utensils in Maximou! He won't have time, I can tell you with certainty! So our aim is to put young people in the front line. Our goal is to get young people to the polls. That is the big bet. And I believe we will achieve it.
