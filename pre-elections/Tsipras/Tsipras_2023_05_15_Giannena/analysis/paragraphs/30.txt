So after you've seen the video and after you've seen all this, I think it's very simple: what exactly do we want to happen next Sunday, six days from now? Who should be the ones celebrating the election results? The democratic citizens or the cartels and the powerful? The democratic citizens, the democratic people or the privileged, the funds, the day labourers? I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the Greek people have answered this question. And next Sunday you can be sure that our people will be celebrating. The democratic people will be celebrating the victory of justice, of democracy, the victory of the people!
