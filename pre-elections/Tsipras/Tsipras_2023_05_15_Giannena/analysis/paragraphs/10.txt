But the time has come, citizens of Ioannina, the time has come to close these great wounds in the body of society once and for all with our participation at the polls on Sunday and with our vote on Sunday. The Greece that is hurting us is finally over in six days from today. And the Greece that we deserve dawns seven days from today. Next Monday we will have a different reality in our country. And this different reality will come with the victory of SYRIZA, which will also be a victory for Change, because it will immediately pave the way for the formation of a progressive government of cooperation, with the aim of restoring justice for all and everywhere.
