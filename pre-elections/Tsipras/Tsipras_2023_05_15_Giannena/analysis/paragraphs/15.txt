Trauma three: an Education, with thousands of young people every year being artificially cut off from universities, denied access to universities, because it has implemented the Minimum Admission Base, in order to give patronage to private colleges. And who usually gets cut? Which kids are in those 20,000 who are cut? Children from middle-class families, with little opportunity for tutoring. And what happens to that? They're languishing at the regional universities, closing down because they don't have students. It also leaves us with an education system with schools without permanent teachers, with 30% being substitutes. And it leaves us with universities without university professors, but with several university police officers. These are the wounds that Mr Mitsotakis leaves us with.
