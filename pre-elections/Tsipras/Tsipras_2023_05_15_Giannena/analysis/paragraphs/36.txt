For us, Health, Education, electricity, water are not a commodity! Water cannot be a commodity. People cannot live without water, and Mr Mitsotakis wants to privatise it. That is his plan. Electricity cannot be a commodity. Without electricity, man cannot live. We have governed for four and a half years in the most difficult conditions. Not a single euro has been added to the electricity bill for consumers. Not a single euro! And health and education cannot be a commodity. A short while ago, a comrade who recently lost her husband came to the hotel where I was staying and met me. She told me one thing: "We don't want buffets from you, we want one thing from you: Health, education, justice."
