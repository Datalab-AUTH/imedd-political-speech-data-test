An unspeakable tragedy, the result of the political immorality of a regime that let the railways fall apart. And you remember, a few days ago, the Minister of Tempi was in parliament taking questions from SYRIZA MPs. And of course he was also receiving letters of apology from the railway workers, who had announced the tragedy. And what did he answer? "Shameful", he would say to them, "talking to me about railway safety". This man hypocritically resigned on the same day of the accident and a few days later, in agreement with Mr Mitsotakis, he was a candidate again, with the New Democracy combinations in Serres, to be washed up in the Pool of Siloam and to continue, despite what he did, to be a Member of Parliament. And if Mitsotakis wins, he will certainly look at being a minister.  Because this party is the party of familialism, the party of brood, where two years, useless brood, came together and we had this fatal result for 57 human souls.
