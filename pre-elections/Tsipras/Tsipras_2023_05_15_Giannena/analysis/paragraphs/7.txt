This is the Greece of Mr Mitsotakis. The Greece that has hurt and hurt every Greek for four years now. It has hurt every young person and every young person who is struggling to make ends meet, to open a home and to start a family. Because the salary ends on the 15th of the month. It has hurt every worker who is forced to work in the sun for a salary that does not even cover basic needs. Hurt every young mother who faces the dilemma every month of what to cut out of her child's diet because the prices of basic necessities have gone through the roof.
