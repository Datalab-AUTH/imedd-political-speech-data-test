But I want to respond to Mr Mitsotakis. We know how to count too, Mr Mitsotakis. And we know how to count, because we have counted euro for euro the money of the Greek citizen, the Greek taxpayer. With honesty. And we left it all intact. We took over empty funds and gave you funds with 37 billion and the country out of the memoranda and the debt settled! We governed with integrity, we know how to count! And not only do we know how to count, but what our motto says, "we know, we can", is a reality. Because not only do we know, this time we are coming outside the framework of the constraints of the Troika and the memoranda. This time we will govern on the basis of our programme, on the basis of our will, not on the basis of 'musts'. And this time your friends in Berlin and Brussels, Mr. Schäuble and Mr. Dijsselbloem, are not there to say 'goodbye, Schäuble and 'hello, Gerun'! They are no longer there to save you!
