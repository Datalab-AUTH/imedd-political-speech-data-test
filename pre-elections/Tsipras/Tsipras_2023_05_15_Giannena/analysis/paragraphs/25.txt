But in the last few days, as I said this morning, Mr Mitsotakis has been very busy because he has to pack his bags at Maximou and there are a lot of things he has to pack. On Monday he leaves for good, on Monday Maximou changes tenants, and he has to pack up the evidence of the crime, to make it disappear, and the Predator cables to dismantle. But in this fury of packing, it seems, he has time to do the math. Because in the last few days, all he's been doing is measuring how much the Syriza program will cost. And he can't get the numbers right. He's lost in the counting, he says, it seems to him that the cost of Syriza's programme is too much. He counted, it seems, the direct assignments he made in the past to day laborers, to companies that were being set up three days before the direct assignments, over 10 billion came out, but that's where the bill came out. He also counted, it seems, the subsidies he gave to the energy cartel, over 10 billion in a year and a half, it seems that's where the bill came out. He also counted the New Democracy's sea loans, over 400 million in loans and unpaid loans. And that's where the bill came out. But with Syriza's programme, the bill does not add up. It has made it a rubber stamp, of course, in the counting. One he said 24, then he said 84, then he said 70, by the election he'll have it up to 170, no doubt about it.
