So our plan for the prefecture of Ioannina, and for Epirus as a whole, of course, includes: The completion of the road axes, the acceleration of the studies for the railway connection of Epirus and of course the increase of flights from the airport "King Pyrrhus". But since I mentioned the railway interconnection, you know that for us, the Egnatia railway is not a summer night's dream, as Mr Mitsotakis said. For us with a vision, not a summer night's dream. The Giannina - Kakavia road remains on paper. New Democracy, for four years now, has been mocking local government and the institutions. The road is vital, as a very large proportion of visitors come from Albania and trade is crucial. This road completes the western axis of the Balkans. It will finally become a reality. Just as the Ionian Road and the Olympic Road were also put into practice in the past.
