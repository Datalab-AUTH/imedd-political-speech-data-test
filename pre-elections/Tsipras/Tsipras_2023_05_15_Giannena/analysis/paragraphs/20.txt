Worse than their responsibility for this tragic accident, however, was the way they managed the accident. I won't dwell on the misery and lies they told, that it was supposedly not their fault but the predecessors' fault. I won't dwell on the unacceptable, miserable show in front of an antiquated console, because there was a catastrophic fire in the summer of '19 in the television department and four years they didn't take care to restore it.
But I will dwell on the lies they told about the appointment, which was a party buffet that was illegal, and I will dwell on what Mr Mitsotakis told us the other day at a television station. "Tempe for us," he said, "was a small and temporary blemish that was forgotten." So no, Mr Mitsotakis! The loss of 57 of our fellow human beings is not a political loss! It is a crime! And we assure you that we will not forget it! We have a moral obligation not to forget. Both to those who perished and to never again be faced with such an unspeakable tragedy.
