So, everything they were saying four years ago did exactly the opposite. And I want to talk to you about two more traumas, two more traumas: The sixth in a row of the trauma that I told you a few moments ago, the sixth in a row, is the great trauma that they are leaving on the state. They are leaving a cloverleaf state, with the 'blue locusts' - I say it right, blue locusts, did we not say blue locusts? - occupying a position in all the public utilities. You remember what they said about us, don't you? That we have increased the number of post-employees. And these godless people doubled their post-employees. And not only did they double them, but they made sure to raise the salary by 30%, because it wasn't enough. But it's not just the temps. It's the party that's going on with the managerial positions in the PPOs - they doubled the managerial positions in all the PPOs to get as many of the so-called blue golden boys, who on the Boards of Directors usually decide to give bonuses, raises to themselves. What else did they do in the state? Appointments outside of the CBA. What else did they do in the state? They devalued its functioning. They even disregarded the safety of the citizen. And indisputable proof of this was the tragic accident two months ago in Tempe.
