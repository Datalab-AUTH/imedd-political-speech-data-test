But I want to wonder and ask why this was the first time we heard Mr Androulakis speak so clearly about the need to hold the parastatals accountable. I want to ask: how exactly will this insurgency be held to account?  With a new New Democracy government of Mr Mitsotakis?  Or with a progressive government? Because if it were, this parastate would have been accountable for 9 months now. So, Mr Androulakis, leave the unhistorical bipartisans and take responsibility for the next day of the country. The hour of crisis is coming for all of us. The bipartisans do not belong to the history that you consider to be your sole spiritual heir. Andreas Papandreou did not have a two-front, he had only one front, with the Right. And today we do not have a two-front, we have only one front: with the worst right-wing since the post-war period. We therefore extend our hand of cooperation to the progressive forces. In order to have a government of cooperation that will support society, but also to repair the great wounds in democracy.
