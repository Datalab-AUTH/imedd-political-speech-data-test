The second important vision and goal for us is Education. So we aim to strengthen public universities, and especially the University of Ioannina. You know, it is one of the best institutions we have. And our country has 6 institutions that are very high in the ranking, in the global ranking. Among them is your university. A university that is of high quality, thanks to the efforts of the teaching staff, who have kept it high quality all these years. But it has many problems, it needs strengthening. It needs student care, it needs student halls of residence, it needs more teachers, it needs better laboratories, it needs research funding. So we have a goal to double the number of professors at the University of Ioannina in the next four years. Because we aim to hire professors in universities, not police officers. Police officers should go to the neighborhoods, to fight crime, not to the universities. Professors want our universities! This is a slogan that probably students must have told us a while ago, because it's about the Minimum Entrance Requirement and the Subject Bank and the better universities that young people dream of. And we must at last strive to make those dreams a reality.
