But for 4 years now, what has the New Democracy government been doing? For 4 years now you would think they have a vindictive attitude towards Arta, towards the continent as a whole, but especially towards Artia, you would think they want to get revenge because Arta has been unlucky for them. So they say it has produced a Prime Minister with the left and they can't stand that. And what did they do? So they have devalued the Faculty of Agriculture for 4 years now by abolishing one of its 2 departments. They cancelled the planning for the agri-food technology park at the Faculty of Agriculture. They cancelled the planning for the mountain park at Cross in Theodorian have left the bypass road on the Athamanius Theodorian road. Just like we left it.
