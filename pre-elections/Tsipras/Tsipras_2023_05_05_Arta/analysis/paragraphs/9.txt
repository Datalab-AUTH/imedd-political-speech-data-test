Are we going to let the Mitsotakis plan for 700,000 for 700,000 mortgaged houses to be auctioned the day after the elections or are we going to impose conditions and rules of justice to save the property of the middle class with fair regulations? These are the crucial dilemmas of the ballot box and against these dilemmas of the ballot box. I will condense them into a dilemma on the 21st, whoever comes out first makes the government Ara. On the 21st, the dilemma is Mitsotakis or change? Mitsotakis or SYRIZA Progressive Alliance and Progressive Co-operation government from the next day. And against this dilemma, fellow countrymen and women. I believe that the vast majority of the Greek people have decided why; because they feel that they can't take it anymore, because they feel that they can't take it anymore with the obscenity, with the corruption, with the eavesdropping and illegal surveillance, with the direct assignments, they can't take it anymore with the family rule, with the injustice, the widespread injustice that prevails in our everyday life and in our lives. And we believe that this is as far as we can go and that we must make the decision and act for the political change that the country needs.
