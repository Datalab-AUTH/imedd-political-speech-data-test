I want you to forgive me for being a little late in coming. But you know I don't travel on the state plane and with Greek taxpayers' money. I did not travel on the state plane for the election campaign, not even when I was Prime Minister, because I did not believe and I do not believe that this state is owned by anyone. Others have been born princes and have the feeling that they own the state and the country. I come from a humble mountain village in Tzoumerka, but I am proud of my origins. I may not be from a fireplace, but we had a fireplace in the family home and we lit them and I know how fireplaces are lit.
