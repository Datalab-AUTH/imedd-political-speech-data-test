But the main thing they have done in these 4 years?It is that they have discredited the public hospital. One of the most important regional hospitals in your city has been left without doctors, without staffing, without infrastructure. It is unthinkable that there is no doctor on duty in the radiology department of the Arta hospital. They say that this is only a matter of circumstance, and we reply if you mean that it is only a matter of circumstance because in 20 days things will change and we will support Arta and this place again.Then yes, it is a matter of circumstance. But their disparagement of your county is not a matter of chance. And if some younger people forget, they remind us with their works for 4 years now.
