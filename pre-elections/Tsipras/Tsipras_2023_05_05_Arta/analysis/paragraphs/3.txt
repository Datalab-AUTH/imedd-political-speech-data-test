So I am with you again to send this message. The message of victory and change, but above all the message that for us there are no citizens, no regions, no B regions. And I want to thank you both for your presence, but also for the fact that you have shown over the years that you appreciate everything that SYRIZA as a government has done for your country, for our country. The prefecture of Arta was a law erased from the map for many, many decades and we tried to bring it out of isolation. In the four years of our government 111 million euros from public funds went to projects in the prefecture of Arta in cooperation with the region and local government. We did not care if the mayors of the region were our own partisans we cared about giving support and breath to this place. And it wasn't just what was valued in money and funds. It was also the development and breath projects that were done for the place that cannot be valued in financial terms. We completed the two major roads in the Olympic Road and the Ionian Road and now you don't need 5 hours to go to Athens from Arta, you arrive in 3 and a half hours. We have put into practice the great vision of the people of Arta, to establish an agricultural school here in Arta and to make the city a city of 3 university schools.We have advanced the great development plan for the delimitation of the river Arachthos. Projects which can put your place back on the map of the territory.
