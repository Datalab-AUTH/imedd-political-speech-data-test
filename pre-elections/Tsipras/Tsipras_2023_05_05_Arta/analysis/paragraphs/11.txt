Seeing you, I am sure that the second will happen. And I'm sure the second one will happen. No matter what the parrots of the system say on your TV sets, remember. We lost in 2019.What did they say? But did we get 32 the 100 E's? What was the average of the polls published 2 days before Friday that the Atheophobes didn't? The 15 days ago they gave us 24.5, we got 31.5, we were only off by 7 points respectively it was 15 and in the election the referendum was off by 20 points.
