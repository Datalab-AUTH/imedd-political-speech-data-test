The only thing that can thwart this plan is the Syriza Progressive Alliance's primary election victory. It is a clear victory on May 21 that will pave the way for change that will pave the way for a government of progressive cooperation. And by appealing to all citizens, by appealing to all citizens, we want to pose the real dilemmas of the ballot box. The dilemma of this ballot box is one. We change or we keep sinking, the bill will continue to not come out. Will households continue to save their income in the third week of the month, not being able to pay the electricity, not being able to go to the supermarket, or will we give households a breather by raising wages by lowering prices by regulating debts.
