So we are saying to all citizens who are currently facing deadlocks, we are saying one thing, the elections on the 21st of this month are not a slack vote. It is an election that produces a government and have no doubt about it. The first party and the third party will be able to form a government on May 22. So is it critical who will be first in this election? And it is crucial. Who will be first? Because make no mistake, if Mr Mitsotakis is first, he will not let this opportunity to form a government go to waste. His government spokesman said it clearly yesterday that he will use the exploratory mandate to form a government. Today, he tried to muddy the waters by saying that he will not cooperate with Mr Androulakis's Kinal. Believe them, I do not believe a word they say, do not believe them if they are the first party, even by half a point, New Democracy will want to take this opportunity to form a rag-tag government by blackmail, by pressure and even by defections. As it is well known that this family knows the knowhow.
