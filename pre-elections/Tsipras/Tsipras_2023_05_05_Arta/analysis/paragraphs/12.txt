So now comes the time of crisis for everyone and we say on election night it will not be the perfect dairy village. It will not be the exception to the color of the Charter. All of Greece will change color, because all of Greece wants change, wants breath, wants justice. So I urge you in these days not to lose a moment. Let us all come together with determination in this struggle, we know and we can bring change and Arta deserves it. The continent, a better perspective justice means supporting the weak. We have proven that we can, but now we know how to support the middle class with a plan and with documentation and with a vision to change Greece. I invite you all together in this great struggle. Fellow countrymen and women, on the 22nd we will be here to celebrate the victory of democracy, the victory of justice, the victory of the forces of progress, and we will form a government of progressive cooperation to take the country forward. Be well. Thank you very much for your presence. Goodbye.
