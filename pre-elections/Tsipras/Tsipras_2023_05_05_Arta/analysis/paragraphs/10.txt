I am sure that your law will once again not only give SYRIZA the lead, but will produce results that will be reminiscent of other times. We are being blamed these days. Why is SYRIZA really talking? With the slogans of the 80s, it hurts them that we are talking about change. Because these slogans are not the property of anyone. The great conquests of the popular movement and the democratic party in our country belong to all democratic citizens and if these slogans have once again become topical, it is the right that is to blame for not changing. The right of Mr Mitsotakis, who surpassed even his father in the three years 90, 93. So that's why now. What we are asking of the citizens, what we are asking of the Greek people is that they should be frightened by their vote and their attitude on the night of the elections on the twenty-first of May, because on that night two things can happen. Either the cartels and the establishment will be celebrating those who regulate obscenity prices. The powers that be who have made billions in the crisis were the democratic people to take to the streets and celebrate a great victory for the great change the country needs.
