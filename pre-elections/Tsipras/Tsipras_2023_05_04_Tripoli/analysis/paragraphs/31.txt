I urge you not to pay attention to much as you see it. I urge you to believe what you see in front of you, talking to your fellow citizens in coffee shops, workplaces, in the squares and not the fake news, not the false bars of the polling numbers that as we get closer to the election will slowly begin to adjust, because they too are afraid that on the 22nd they too will be defeated.
