We also want to substantially support public health. And here in Tripoli you have had heavy and sad experience of the public hospital, the state it is in and the dramatic negative firsts you had during the pandemic. And public hospitals cannot be sustained if there is no intervention to strengthen the staff, if we do not make permanent all those who worked on the front line, defying the danger during the pandemic, auxiliary doctors and nursing staff. If we do not increase spending and if we do not give incentives to young doctors to come to the national health system, because a young person who has spent his whole life on the bench cannot come to the NHS for EUR 800 when he knows that he can go to any other European country and get four or five thousand euros. That is why for us it is a commitment, â‚¬2 000 for the salary of the first doctor appointed.
