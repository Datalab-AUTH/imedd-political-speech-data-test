Friends, citizens of Tripoli, Arcadia, I want to reiterate that this will be a crucial electoral battle. And it looks like it will be a controversial battle. Many are telling you that there will be a second run-off. I want to say that those who pretend to say that there will be a run-off are actually disparaging the popular verdict. The country does not need double and triple elections. The country can be reliably governed by the result of the ballot box of the simple proportional representation. As all indications suggest, the first and third parties will be able to form a government. So I ask you that the first party should be SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance, so that we can have a progressive government, so that our lives, our everyday life, can be changed. I ask you to give a strong mandate to SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance on the evening of May 21 to form this long-lasting stable progressive government on the basis of the 11 articles of the change contract program that we released yesterday.
