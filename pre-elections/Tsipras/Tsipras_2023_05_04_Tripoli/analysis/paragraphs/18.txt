At the same time we have a plan for a substantial reform of the state. We want a state with accountability, with meritocracy, with justice, and we also want to ensure that some goods that cannot be traded are public. Like water, like energy, these are goods that cannot be traded. That is why we will re-nationalise 51% of the shares, we will bring 51% of the shares of the PPC back under public control. We will transfer the shares of EVDAP. Because water, I repeat, cannot be privately owned. We will bring it, we will take it from where it is today, from where Mr Mitsotakis has foreseen to give it to private individuals in the next four years, and we will keep it under public control and at the same time we will create a public pillar of the banking system, so that this misery will stop.
