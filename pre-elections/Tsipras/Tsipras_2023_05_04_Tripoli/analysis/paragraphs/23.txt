And they changed the law, not by following the obvious. What we suggested to them. That is, to add to the existing law, an explicit sentence that those who are finally convicted of crimes under 157 of the criminal code will not be able, their parties, those who have such scruples, to run. They didn't do that. They gave the authority to a closed group of judges to decide who can and cannot run. Why? Because ultimately their target was not Kasidiaris. Their goal was to control which parties would run and which would not from the so-called Right Wing. And a bomb dropped in the right wing building these days. Some apartments were destroyed and collapsed, others were left standing. The apartments of those parties that have declared their loyalty to Mitsotakis for the next election day will run in the elections. Those that have not given their faith will not run in the elections. And now it is revealed exactly what the President of the Supreme Court department who resigned just before Easter, denouncing methodologies and that Mr. Gerapetritis caught him in a caf√©, outside Maximou and told him do one thing and do another and we will make you head of an independent authority.
