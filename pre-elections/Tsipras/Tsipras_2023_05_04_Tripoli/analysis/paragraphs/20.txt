Friends, we submit this plan to the knowledge of Greek society. We submit it to the knowledge of all the progressive forces of the country, but above all to the knowledge of the democratic and progressive citizens. And we say to them: On May 21, there are two versions. In the evening the big interests, the establishment and the oligarchs celebrate. If the first party is the new democracy of Mr. Mitsotakis or in the evening the people can take to the streets to celebrate. Let the democratic citizens celebrate, let the progressive citizens celebrate, because if Syriza wins, we will have a government of progressive cooperation the next day. It is not just to bring down the right. It is to bring down the worst right that we have seen since the post-independence period until today. Because there is no other right-wing government that has done what Mr Mitsotakis has done. And I'm not just talking about his economic policies. How he has plundered the middle class, despite what he promised it, in order to support the powerful. We knew this, we were saying it before the elections and some people did not believe us.
