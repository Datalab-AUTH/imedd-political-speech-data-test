Debt settlement means that we will restore the protection of the first home, of commercial housing and of agricultural land, by abolishing the bankruptcy law that Mr Mitsotakis voted for, because he has a plan to proceed with 700,000 auctions in order to continue the obscenity and the excess profits of the big funds that are also partners. We will therefore impose rules on the funds and we will proceed with regulations that are compulsory for the funds, subsidising the instalments and with a large haircut on the mortgage instalment in order to protect the middle class. Because we do not want to fool the middle class, like Mr Mitsotakis, but we want to protect the middle class.
