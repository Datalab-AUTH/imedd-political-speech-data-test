96% of small and medium-sized enterprises today cannot even get past the banks. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who have shops here on this pedestrian shopping street know this all too well, and they know that only those who can prove that they do not need to borrow money can get loans from the banks today. And what's worse, they're the ones who get the funds, the loans from the Recovery Fund. Mr Mitsotakis has given 622 million to 13 big businessmen who don't know where to put the money they have. And the rest of them can't even get out, I repeat, out of the banks to get financing. So that's going to end. That means we will bring justice. We will support those in need and not the powerful with a public pillar, using the public sector position, the National Bank and the Development Bank.
