We will strengthen employment by restoring all the Hatzidakis-Mitsotakis regulations that were essentially a gift to the employers, to those employers who stand next to Mr Georgiades and threaten the workers, terrorize them that if they don't vote for New Democracy they will be fired. And we say to the people of work, to the workers, do not listen to the threats. Terrorize the terrorists. On May 21, show your strength, give perspective and hope to your own lives.
