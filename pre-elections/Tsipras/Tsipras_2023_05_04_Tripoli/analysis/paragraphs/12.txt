And of course a series of commitments in all the other articles of the contract that I discussed yesterday, which are about a fair, effective, strong welfare state with interventions to strengthen public education, public education, which the Mitsotakis government has devalued and it is our commitment that we will become a normal European country. What does this mean? It means that 30% of the teachers in schools will not be substitutes but we will have recruitment, so that it will be at 5% as in all European countries. It means that in public universities we will hire teachers and not police officers. Police officers will go to the neighbourhood to fight crime and not to the universities.
