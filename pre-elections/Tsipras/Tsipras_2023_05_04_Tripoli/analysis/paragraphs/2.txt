Because for 4 years now, unfortunately, the country has gone backwards very much backwards. Inequalities have increased rapidly. I remember in 2019, Mr Mitsotakis came here to your city of Tripoli in May 19. And what did he say? That he would be, he said, the prime minister of all Greeks. When she becomes Prime Minister, he said, she will be the Prime Minister of all Greeks. And four years later it turned out what? That she was not of all Greeks. He was the prime minister of the powerful, of the rich, who became richer during this whole period. He was the creator of obscenity. Middle class he promised to support, living on food stamps. Coupons at the supermarket, coupons for electricity, coupons to go to the gas station. So, the Prime Minister of obscenity.
