And we say that now comes the crucial moment for the Greek people to choose how they will see the dawn on May 22. Who will be the government that will be called upon to take over the fate of the country for the next four years? Some people are trying to convince us that these elections, because they are elections of parity of vote, elections of simple proportional representation, are elections of loose voting. They are wrong. We have a simple proportional representation election, but that doesn't mean we haven't had a simple proportional representation election. Whoever comes first will form the government the next day. He will have the ability to form a government. Simple proportional representation gives parity of vote. Simple logic obliges us to make the vote count. And a SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance primary on the evening of May 21 means political change.  It is the warning of political change means that the next day we will form a government of longevity and stability on a program of convergence with the progressive forces of the country, on a progressive program, which we presented in the past few days and yesterday we released the 11 articles of the contract of change. That is what we called it. Contract of Change. We want to conclude a contract of change first and foremost with the Greek people. Everyone should know that by voting for SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance on 21 May, they are signing these 11 commitments, these 11 articles that concern our lives, our everyday life, our future. I have tried many times to explain that a vote for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance for a progressive government means 4 basic things, a wage increase, debt regulation, price reduction and a fair, efficient, strong welfare state. That is what I analysed yesterday.
