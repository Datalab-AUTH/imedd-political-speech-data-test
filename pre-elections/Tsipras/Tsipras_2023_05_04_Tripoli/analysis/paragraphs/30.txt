The alternative is to have one of the same for another 4 years. Disdain for society, arrogance, a PM who lives in his own world and doesn't care because that's what he's learned as a human being. He was born a prince and once he became prime minister, he thought he was king. He doesn't care. He doesn't even understand what the needs of everyday people are. And I'm afraid that now, if he is re-elected, he will be a prime minister who will do much, much worse than everything he did in the last four years. The illegal surveillance scandal, this system of manipulation in the judiciary and in the media, will be perhaps a small foretaste of everything that will follow next four years. If all this arrogance, if all this arrogance, if all this disdain, this institutional disdain, is rewarded with the vote of the Greek people. I know very well, I know very well, that this will not happen. But I know very well that it is important not just to be first, but to be first by a large margin in the elections of 21 May. The stronger our lead, the more certain the political change. Finally, I want to assure you that we will see a great deal between now and the ballot box on 21 May. We will see a great deal, perhaps more than we have seen in any election, because we have a system of power, an establishment that is currently in a panic and knows that the only hope is to cling to power by any means possible.
