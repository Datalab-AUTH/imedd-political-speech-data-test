So we have one thing to say in the face of this misery, and I refer to all democratic citizens. Greece must become a normal European country on 22 May. On 22 May, Greece must not only restore justice everywhere, but must bring democracy back to power. That is what we must do, to bring democracy. I would also like to say a few words about your country, because apart from the fact that Mitsotakis promised you that he would be Prime Minister for you, like all the other Greeks, but he was only for the powerful, for the locusts, the crows and the ravens, as I said, he also promised you rabbits and stones for the Peloponnese, for Arcadia. What has he done four years later?
