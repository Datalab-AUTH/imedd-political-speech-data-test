I say this to you, I am telling you that we are already ahead, and I call on you with your vote and with your action throughout this period to make SYRIZA's victory, the victory of democracy, the victory of justice, the victory of the people on May 21, even greater, even clearer. Be well. Good strength. Thank you very much. Thank you for today's gathering. Goodbye!
