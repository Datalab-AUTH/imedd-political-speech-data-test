Citizens of Tripoli, thank you for this warm welcome here in your city. And although there are many of you in broad daylight, like many of you, we will finally be at the ballot box to bring the great change that the country needs. Because the many want change. They want a change in their lives in their everyday lives. No more. So much for obscenity. Enough with injustice. Enough of corruption. Enough with family rule. We want the next day for our country to be a day of hope and perspective, to support the living forces of society. To support the workers, the people of labour, the people of creation, the farmers, the young people who are leaving and emigrating, not only from their regions, but also from the country. We want to create the conditions for a government of progressive cooperation, a long-term government that will give stability, that will give justice, that will fight the great inequalities.
