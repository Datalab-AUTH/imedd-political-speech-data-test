So we are not here today to present you a science fiction project in a fake futuristic artificial intelligence environment, but a Contract that encapsulates a dialogue that has been going on for years with all social groups. With the social majority. And a Contract that mirrors the wills of the social majority, but also the necessary breakthroughs to lead these wills to concrete and measurable measures of justice. A Contract whose articles have been shaped by many experts, many scientists, truly excellent, not in the sense that New Democracy has introduced into the political life of the country, technocrats and experts who put the interests of the many above all else. Not excellent in the sense that they are coming to staff an executive state, but a democratic, social state at the service of the citizen. That makes a big difference. A realistic and achievable contract. Because what we expect is not only change in the government of the country, but also in our lives, in the everyday life of the people.
