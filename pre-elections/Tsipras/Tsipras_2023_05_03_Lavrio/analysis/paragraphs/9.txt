Article 2: From the very first days we have been legislating to deal effectively with price inflation, to contain and reduce prices. We reduce VAT on food to 6%. For essential products (baby food, milk, bread), we are moving to a zero VAT rate. We reduce the VAT on fuel to the minimum rate provided for by European legislation and abolish the VAT refund on agricultural and livestock oil for our farmers and livestock farmers.  We are strengthening the control mechanisms and introducing intensive controls on the markets, with very strict controls, in order to break up the cartels. We are introducing extraordinary taxation of accumulated excess profits and sky-high profits and we are introducing a cap on the profitability of companies in sectors that systematically show excess profits. We promote energy communities for self-production and self-consumption of electricity, with the aim of having at least 50% of new licences for energy communities and self-production. Because today, unfortunately, the government has discredited this great reform of SYRIZA and is giving access to the grid only to large companies.  We are restoring the transport equivalent, another great reform that we made for our islanders. We are restoring it because it has been discredited and we are restoring the regularity of payments and extending the beneficiaries.  Finally, we are reducing the cost of the monthly unlimited travel card for public transport from 27 euros today to 10 euros.
