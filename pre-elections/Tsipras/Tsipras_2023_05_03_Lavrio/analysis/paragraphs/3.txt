So that every Greek can plan their future, plan their life safely. To feel again that they have a government they trust. And that requires a plan, it requires documentation, it requires vision. I would say that our programme is a contract that is about changing the daily lives of citizens. A true Contract for change. Because I think that all of us, all of us who are in society, feel what comes out of the daily contact with citizens. That it can't go on any longer. No more of precision, no more of corruption and corruption, no more of the crony state, no more of the blue grasshoppers who have attacked public wealth, no more of the parastate, no more of the family state, no more of the generalised state of corruption and injustice, no more of the family state. It is time to say 'so much for all that'. Greece cannot belong to the rich and powerful. Greece does not belong to a few families who share its wealth and clothing. Greece can only belong to all of us, to all Greeks.
