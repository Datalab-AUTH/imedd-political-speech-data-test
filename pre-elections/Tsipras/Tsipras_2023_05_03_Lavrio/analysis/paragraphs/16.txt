Article 9: We resolutely strengthen culture and the people of cultural creation. We safeguard the public character of cultural heritage. We abolish the Decree 85/2022 and integrate the artistic specialties into the level of Technological Education, by law.  We strengthen and develop artistic education for the performing arts by establishing a Higher School of Performing Arts and strengthening existing university departments. We are upgrading arts education qualifications (music, dance, theatre, film) to a level equivalent to that of Technological Education. All these were demands of a very important movement that we saw from the people of art and culture, who filled the streets of the big cities in colourful colours throughout the previous period. And we are responding to these demands and putting them into practice.
