Friends, I have presented to you, as briefly and concisely as possible, what we call the Contract of Change, what we are proposing to the Greek people and what we want to conclude with them in the elections of May 21. To make this Contract on 22 May a charter and a foundation for the common programme of progressive governance. Our political opponents, the New Democracy, were quick to cost our commitments prohibitively before even hearing them. They are used to this. The programme that we presented at the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair was priced at 25 billion. Four months later, they priced the same programme at 45 billion. The day before yesterday, they priced it at 85 billion. The Prime Minister came out yesterday morning, he said it was 70. They've lost the plot in the count. The truth is that anything that smells even remotely of justice and support for the many, to those who govern us, is expensive. Anything that attempts to cancel the party of interests, the party of party officials, is unworkable for them. While anything that fosters corruption and institutionalizes the impunity of the few is unrealistic.
