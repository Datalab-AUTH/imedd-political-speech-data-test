Article 7: It concerns our investment in the future. We invest in the future by generously supporting all levels of education. We are increasing funding over four years for education to 5% of GDP. We are doubling funding for universities over four years. We advertise teacher appointments with the aim that in the course of four years, the number of substitutes will make up 5% of the number of permanent teachers, up from the current 30%. We are doubling the number of professors in our universities over four years. We are decisively increasing public spending on research and transferring supervision back to the Ministry of Education. We abolish the Minimum Admission Base for access to universities from this year, with the immediate reinstatement of Law 4610/2019. Those families who are struggling, those young children who are fighting the battle of the exams this hour, know that we will come to tear down the fences that Ms Kerameos and Mr Mitsotakis have put up in your lives, in your access, in your right to access higher education. Finally, we abolish the university police; because we will double the number of professors in universities. The police officers in the neighborhoods to deal with crime.
