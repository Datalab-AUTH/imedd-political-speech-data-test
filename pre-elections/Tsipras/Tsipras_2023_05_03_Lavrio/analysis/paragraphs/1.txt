I want to thank you all for being here today, in a very symbolic place, in the Lavrio Technology Park, which was once a place that was full of the life of people of toil and work, who dug the earth to make wealth. And today is an important day for us here in this symbolic place. Because today, to you and to all Greek citizens who are watching us, we will present our programme, we will present to the Greek people, but especially to every democratic and progressive citizen, what we call the Contract of Change. A contract of justice and stability. Because the time of the big decisions, as you know, is approaching. The time when history is being written is approaching. And it is the conviction of all of us that the time has come again, the time to bring great change to the lives and daily lives of citizens. It is our duty to all of us to be present in this new rendezvous with history. But this time we must prepare ourselves properly, with vision and with a plan. With a programme that is realistic but at the same time feasible.
