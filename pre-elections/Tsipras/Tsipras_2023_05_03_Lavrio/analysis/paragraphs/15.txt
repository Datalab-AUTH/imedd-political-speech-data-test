Article 8o: We resolutely support young people and women, change the integration policy and put a brake on the demographic ageing of the population. We are giving 900,000 women the maternity allowance (formerly known as child benefit), which they will receive from the birth of their child until the age of 24, regardless of their studies, and from their retirement age for life. We increase the maternity allowance for the second child, from €70 to €105 per month, and broaden the income criteria for granting it. Equalise maternity leave for private and public sector workers.  We extend the maternity allowance for self-employed freelancers and farmers from 4 to 9 months. We introduce maternity leave for self-employed, freelance and farm workers. We ensure free admission of all children to nursery schools. We double the rent subsidy for young people aged 25-44. We are creating a Housing Bank to provide affordable housing for young couples.  We ban Airbnb for legal entities. We double the rent subsidy and broaden the eligibility criteria. We simplify the naturalization process on the basis of European standards, because this is how we will become Europe, with the aim of granting citizenship more quickly and fairly to thousands of people who have lived and worked for decades in our country.
