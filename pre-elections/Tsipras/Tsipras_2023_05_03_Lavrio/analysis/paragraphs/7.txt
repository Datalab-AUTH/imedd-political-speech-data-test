With this in mind, I have the honour and pleasure to present to you immediately the 11 articles of the Contract of Change. Article 1: From the first days of progressive government, we have been legislating to raise wages and incomes. We are raising the minimum wage, from 1 July 2023, to 880 euros in the private sector and we are introducing an annual indexation at the rate of inflation of the previous year. We unfreeze the triennials to achieve an immediate generous increase in the average wage. We increase public sector wages, effective July 1, '23, by 10%.
