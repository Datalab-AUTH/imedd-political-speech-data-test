Article 3: From the first days of progressive governance, we have been making bold interventions to regulate debts and protect first homes, commercial housing and agricultural land. We are regulating private debt to insurance funds and the tax authorities, with the cancellation of part of the basic debt for debts created after the outbreak of the health crisis, and with 120 instalments for the repayment of the remaining debt. Those who lost the 2019 arrangement will also be eligible to join the scheme. We immediately suspend first home auctions for properties up to 300,000 euros. We submit to Parliament the comprehensive plan to replace the bankruptcy law of the New Democracy, with permanent measures to regulate debts and protect first homes, commercial housing and agricultural land. We are legislating a framework of rules for the supervision and taxation of the activities of funds holding red loans.  Legislate a binding framework for an out-of-court settlement mechanism with mandatory creditor participation. The mechanism, as we presented it at a special event a few days ago, is simple and automatic, through an online platform, and gives two options for settlement: a short-term one (5 to 10 years), with a large write-off of the nominal value of the loan (40% to 60%); a long-term one (up to 35 years), with payment of the objective value of the mortgaged property in low instalments and a fixed interest rate of 2%. In each case, we provide for a state subsidy of up to 50% of the instalment with extended social criteria. We are reintroducing the possibility of recourse to the courts in the event of failure to settle out of court, with a short specific time limit for adjudication.
