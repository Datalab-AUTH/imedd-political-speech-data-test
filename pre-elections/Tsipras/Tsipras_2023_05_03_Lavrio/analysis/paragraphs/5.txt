So we know and we can change the course of the country. We know and we can bring about the change that will give breath to the many. And the Contract we present today is intended to serve that purpose. It is, I would argue, the Road Map of the next progressive government. But it is also a Contract with society, which contains our commitments to a government of progressive cooperation for the long term. Our proposal for a common programme of governance. And on 21 May, obviously, we will ask the Greek people to ratify this Contract by their vote. So let everyone know from today onwards that by voting for SYRIZA-PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE on May 21, they are simultaneously putting their signature to this Contract that we will present to you today. Because this is the programmatic basis on which we will call on the day after the elections, with the strong support of the Greek people, the progressive forces of the country to agree. Openly, transparently, without backroom deals under the table. Transparently and openly. For a government of stability and longevity. To put into practice the basic fourfold interventions that the social majority needs: Wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a fair and efficient state alongside the citizen. The Contract for Change that I am presenting to you today has 11 articles. Many of them will be made by commitments into action in the first 50 days of progressive governance. So that the citizen can see immediate breath and support in their lives. Change. To see that something is changing for the better immediately and to see that a path of justice for the country is immediately beginning. But other articles, such as those concerning the major and necessary breakthroughs and reforms in the state, will bring results gradually, over a period of four years.
