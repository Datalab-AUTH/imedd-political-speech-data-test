So I want to conclude by reassuring them. Our commitments cost much less than their direct awards have cost all this time. They are measures that will revitalise the economy, they are measures that will breathe life into society, they are measures that will strengthen social cohesion. Because 'Justice Everywhere' is not just a moral rule for us. It is also an incentive, a means, an accelerator of growth. The Contract for Change is what we want it to be and it is a Contract with society. We invite society to sign it on 21 May. And they will sign it. Against every lie, every slander, every propaganda, every blackmail and every intimidation. It will endorse it and with its support and its vote, it will turn the Contract of Change into a Contract of Victory in the May 21 elections.  I therefore call on all of you to co-sign this Contract today and to fight the battle. To fight the battle house by house, vote by vote, so that the great change becomes a reality, with the victory of SYRIZA. To get a strong mandate. Not just a primary. A strong mandate. To bring change to people's lives and everyday life. That is our goal, that is our vision. We know, we can, we will!  Be well. Good strength and with victory! Thank you.
