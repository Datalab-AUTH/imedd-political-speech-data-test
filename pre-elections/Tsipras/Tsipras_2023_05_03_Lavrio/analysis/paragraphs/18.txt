Article 11: We reform the state, for more meritocracy, accountability, justice. We abolish the law - an anecdote, but let me put it this way - of the executive state. What staff state? There never was a staff state! So we are abolishing this anecdote law. No position in a permanent administrative hierarchy shall be occupied by a temporary official. We strengthen the AESEP: all recruitment is carried out under the supervision of the AESEP. We establish Transparency for the monitoring of technical projects and a Digital Register for all public infrastructure. After the tragic accident in Tempe, we have to go for this reform that will ensure the prospect of safety for all public works.  We are reforming the operation and the institutional framework of the Greek Police in order to deal effectively with crime. The Greek Police will from now on fight the Greek Mafia, not cooperate with the Greek Mafia. We are bringing back the NIS to the Ministry of Citizen Protection. We are repealing the amendment that does not allow the disclosure of surveillance by the NSA after its completion. We legislate the definition of national security. Because Greece must become a European state governed by the rule of law. A European rule of law. We must never again experience this abuse of power, this moral decay, this violation of democratic values that we experienced with the illegal surveillance by the Mitsotakis government.
