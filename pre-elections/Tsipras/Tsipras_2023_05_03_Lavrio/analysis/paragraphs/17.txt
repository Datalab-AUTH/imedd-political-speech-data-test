Article 10: We support people with disabilities. Because otherwise there can be no justice everywhere, justice for all and for all.  We increase the expenditure of disability benefits by 20%, regardless of age criteria, by removing existing injustices in categories of disabled people. We are radically reforming the system of diagnosis and certification, with the strengthening of the CERPs and staffing these centres with social specialities. Ensure accessibility in all public buildings within the next three years. And this is a commitment. All public buildings will have accessibility. We are developing and implementing, in cooperation with local government, a pilot programme of 20 fully accessible neighbourhoods. We are ensuring that 70,000 people will be provided with an assistant or carer, depending on the needs of the disabled person, even on a 24-hour basis.
