However, all our interventions and all our commitments serve a great national goal: To make Greece a normal European country. Which means to converge with the average of the eurozone countries in terms of income, health services, education, the welfare state, the level of labour relations, public infrastructure, citizen's security. This requires a plan for generous public and private investment in human capital, infrastructure, welfare state structures and, in particular, public health structures. And at the same time it requires a major shift in the production model. Investment in innovation, in the production of quality products, in technological support for business activities, in high added value. Our central commitment, therefore, to achieve this is to redirect the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund, which until now have been lavishly allocated to a few business groups, without leaving a real development, employment and social footprint. Let us therefore redirect the resources of the Recovery and Resilience Fund so that we do not squander this great opportunity for the country.
