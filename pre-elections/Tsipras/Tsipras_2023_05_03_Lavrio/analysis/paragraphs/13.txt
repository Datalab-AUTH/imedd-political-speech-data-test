Article 6: We are building a new strong NHS, for decent health care and healthcare for all. And if you want me to say here that, in my opinion, this 6th article is perhaps the biggest and most important vision, the biggest and most important mission that the new progressive government of the country will have to accomplish. After all we have been through in the pandemic, we cannot settle for anything less than the reconstitution of the NHS, to have health care and health care for all Greeks, regardless of their financial ability. So what do we do: We increase public spending on health to 7% of GDP over four years. We restore the public character of the NHS, by annulling the laws of New Democracy on doctors' labour relations and the privatisation of the Health System. We proceed immediately to a generous wage upgrade for doctors and other employees of the NHS. This is our moral obligation. With a starting salary of 2.000 euros for doctors, with the inclusion of nurses in the heavy and unhealthy workforce, with a new set of incentives (labour, financial, social, educational, scientific development) to attract medical personnel to the NHS, with special care for inaccessible - island regions but also for specialties in shortage and barren departments and clinics throughout the country, We are giving those who were on the front line of the pandemic - and this is our moral commitment -, auxiliary doctors and nursing staff. And we are moving over four years to 15,000 targeted recruitments, while establishing a mechanism to automatically fill retirement vacancies. We are reintroducing Fixed Term Contracts in cleaning, security and catering in hospitals. Strengthen Primary Health Care, with the aim of operating 380 Local Health Units across the country by the end of the next four years. Finally, we are strengthening the institution of the family doctor by using private doctors under contract with EOPYY.
