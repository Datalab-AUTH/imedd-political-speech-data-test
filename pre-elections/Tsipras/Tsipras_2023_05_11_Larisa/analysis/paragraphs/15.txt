But fortunately there are international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. What has the OECD proved in the past few days through its investigations? What did it find? It found that Mr Mitsotakis's Greece is the only country in Europe in which the income of its citizens has fallen dramatically over the years. He found that Mr Mitsotakis' Greece - the OECD said this - in the three years 2019-2021, was the only European country that had a nominal decrease in average wages. And he also found that Mitsotakis' Greece was one of only three countries in Europe that even in 2022 had a nominal decline in the average real wage. Mr Mitsotakis came out the next day and said "I refute the OECD". He has no problem!
