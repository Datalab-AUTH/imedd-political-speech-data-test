In short, friends, SYRIZA has made a titanic effort to get the country out of the crisis. To regulate, and it has regulated the public debt. It left 37 billion in the public coffers. We were the only government that the next government we handed over to could not claim that we handed over chaos. We had an obligation to raise, with sacrifice and difficulty, 40 billion to get the country out of the crisis and out of bankruptcy. And Mr Mitsotakis was able to spend 60. And I ask you: If instead of having the obligation to raise 40, we had the discretion to spend, is this what the country would look like today? Would this be the country of public hospitals? Would this be the picture of public universities? Would this be the picture of a welfare state? Would we be leaving the citizens today without a sunny fate if we had this discretion that Mr Mitsotakis had? Mr Mitsotakis, however, spent this money on "day labourers", direct awards, closed tenders and subsidies to obscenity. And, unfortunately, there is almost nothing left to create a dike against this great crisis for the middle class and the weak.
