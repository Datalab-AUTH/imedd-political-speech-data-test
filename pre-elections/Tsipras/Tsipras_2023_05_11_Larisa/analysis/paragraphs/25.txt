Friends, a few days ago, as you know, we published our programme, we published the "Contract for Change". That's what we called it, a Contract for Change with 11 articles, which crosses all 11, I would say, a red line. What is this line? The line of justice. What our program, the Contract of Change, provides for: I will say it briefly, so that it stays with all of you who are at this stage and you will be able to very easily convey it to all the citizens you meet. This Contract of Change means 4 things: Raising wages, lowering prices, regulating debt and a fair and efficient government. The Greek people need a government that cares about the ordinary citizen. It needs a government that cares for the farmer, the small and medium sized farmer, the worker, the student, all those who feel underprivileged, unprivileged.It does not need a government that cares only for the powerful. That is why we deeply believe that our slogan, "Justice everywhere", is a slogan that can touch the soul of the vast majority of Greek citizens. And that our second slogan, the slogan "Change", is not just a party slogan. Change is also a struggle, a social, political and national necessity. In the coming elections, our people will be called upon to answer a crucial dilemma. The crucial dilemma is: Mitsotakis again or change? Is it Mitsotakis again or justice? Mitsotakis again or SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance? I am sure that the vast majority will answer this dilemma and vote for SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance. So SYRIZA has drawn a road map, so to speak, the path to justice, step by step. This is our programme. This is the Contract of Change. Because they are scared, they are going out in the media these days and telling all kinds of lies.
