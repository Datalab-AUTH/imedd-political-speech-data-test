And because yesterday I also heard from the nice Secretary of the Communist Party, who lately - yesterday he appeared as a chomper, and we are scratching at his glue - I want to tell him to know one thing: Progressive citizens, left-wing citizens, communists, are not sheep. And they understand that the great critical dilemma of the ballot box on May 21 is whether the next day we will have a government that will support the worker, that will restore labor legitimacy, that will re-establish the Labor Inspectorate, that will abolish unpaid overtime and restore eight-hour work, collective bargaining. We can't help but be concerned that we are witnessing this terror that we saw with the employer next to the Minister of Development, terrorizing workers that if they don't vote for New Democracy and vote for Syriza, he will fire them. This is the picture today in the labour market. And there can't be any progressive, any democrat, any left-wing citizen who doesn't understand this big stake, the stakes of the ballot box.
