You want another example of excellence? The second example of excellence has to do with the people I met outside this stadium just before I went in. And they are the representatives from the village of Damasi, which was hit by the earthquake three years ago, but 130 people are still living in containers and 64 housing units. This is the excellence of the Mitsotakis government, three years later. I wonder what happened to that horseman who came to meet our Prime Minister? I wonder what happened? I wonder if he lives in a container or in a proper house? So I want to make a commitment to these people that we will be concerned about their rehabilitation. And our plan includes a number of interventions that will support the people of production, the farmers, the ranchers. But we will not forget the people who have been affected. We will not make vague promises, but we will try immediately, as quickly as possible, to create those conditions that will enable them to live like normal people in their own country.
