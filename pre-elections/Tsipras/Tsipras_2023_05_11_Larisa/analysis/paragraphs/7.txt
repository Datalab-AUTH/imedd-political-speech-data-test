And the dilemma becomes even more profound and existential as we head towards the polls. It is clear that Mitsotakis is attempting to baptize himself in the pool of Siloam, to wash away his crimes against democracy with the vote of the citizens. I therefore want to address not only the progressive citizens from here in Larissa today. I also want to address the conservative citizens, those who are traditionally in New Democracy, who have serious ideological differences, but who are honest people. They are honest people and they will not tolerate seeing this party today end up violating and abusing democracy. I want to address those who listened carefully to what even their former leader and former Prime Minister, Kostas Karamanlis, said about the wiretapping scandal last August. "That it is illegal, undemocratic and unthinkable and there is no secrecy in the face of the need for a clean-up," he had said. I am sure that all those who heard him then, and who are New Democrats, feel ashamed of what Mitsotakis did and what it turns out he did by abusing the rule of law. And I want to ask them: Will you also be complicit? Will you wash away this shame for democracy and your party with your vote?
