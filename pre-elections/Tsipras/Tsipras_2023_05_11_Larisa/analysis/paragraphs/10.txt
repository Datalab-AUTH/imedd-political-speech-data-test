And we are first, because the NHS has never been strengthened. We were challenged in Parliament to prove that those intubated outside ICUs do not have the same chance of being saved as patients in ICUs. While at the same time, he knew and hid the report by Professors Tsiodra and Lytra, who had given it to him in good time, and said the exact opposite. And after the pandemic, instead of Mr Mitsotakis taking the decision to strengthen our public hospitals, he took the decision to finish them off. And he opened the way for health speculators to sneak into the NHS. It's unthinkable, but it's true. Today we have fewer doctors and nurses than we had when we handed over before the pandemic. This is the situation that exists in the NHS today.
