It is now obvious: they see the vote of the Greek people as a wash for their own missteps and they don't care about the real problems. They do not even care about people's grief, about their deep sorrow. But those of us who do care, and there are many of us, will neither forget this crime nor become complacent. For we are haunted by the moral obligation to vindicate the victims and their families, as far as possible. And above all, so that there will never be another tragedy like this one.So, from here, from Larissa, the scene of this tragic accident, I will say it again: we will not forget. We have no right to forget. No one and nothing will be forgotten. And the knife will go to the bone.  Citizens of Larissa, the guilty policies are unfortunately reflected in the lives of innocent people, in the lives of many. And since "Update 108" was recently promoted and became 107, not because we made a leap forward, but because some third-world country came up, "Update 107" therefore does not allow us to know, to let the citizens know, to learn the exploits of this government.
