That is why I deeply believe that the time has come to give an answer at the ballot box. An answer of perspective and hope. And I want, citizens of Larissa, from here, from Larissa of the rural struggles, from Larissa of resistance and democracy, a few kilometres away from your own Killler, the emblematic landmark of the struggle of the peasants of Thessaly, of the rural uprising for land and freedom, a few kilometres away also from Pyrgettos, where the socialist Marinos Antipas, murdered by the Tsiflicans, breathed his last breath. I want to remember, I can't help but remember his words, his last words: 'Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood'. And I want to say here from Larissa, the city of great struggles, how topical they remain, how dramatically topical these words, these concepts, how dramatically topical the concept of equality remains today, when inequalities in our country are rapidly widening, when the poor are becoming poorer and the rich richer.When in the third week of the month you cannot pay your electricity bills or go to the supermarket, but 15 major listed companies on the stock exchange have been profitable for 20 years with over 1 billion in profits each.
