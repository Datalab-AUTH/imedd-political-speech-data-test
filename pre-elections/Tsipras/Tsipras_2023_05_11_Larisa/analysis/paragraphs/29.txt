So I want to tell you that we, apart from the 11 points, we have already prepared - because you know, justice must not be delayed in some cases - we have already prepared a legislative act, which will be signed immediately with the formation of the progressive government. A legislative act before the Members of Parliament enter the House to start the procedures of passing bills. Do you know what this act contains? Three things. First, the suspension of all first home auctions until the Comprehensive Property Debt Protection Plan is enacted.
