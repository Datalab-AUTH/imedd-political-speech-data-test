A fellow citizen here, a person with a disability, pointed out to me that this government has abandoned people with disabilities. One of the 11 points of the Contract for Change that we put before the Greek people is the effective support of people with disabilities. It is accessibility, it is the 20% increase in disability benefit and the broadening of the criteria. It is the restoration, if you like, of our culture. We cannot have public buildings that are inaccessible. Our roads, not to be accessible. You're lucky because you have a mayor who cares. You're lucky. But not everyone is lucky.
