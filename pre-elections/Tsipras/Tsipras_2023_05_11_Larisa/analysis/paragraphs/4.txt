So I was talking about the relevance of the message of Marinos Adypa: "Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood". And I hope that at least this time I will not be accused of stealing the slogans of Marinos Adypa too, eh? But I want to say it, I want them to understand it well, I want everyone to understand it: If SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance represents and inspires today these great ideals, these universal human values, these great slogans that have always been the common heritage of all democratic forces of the country, of democratic citizens, of the progressive citizens, of the socialist forces of our country, if SYRIZA today represents them and expresses them authentically, it is because SYRIZA is a popular movement with deep roots in the history of the struggles of this people. It is because SYRIZA today is a genuine expression and core of the democratic and progressive party of our country. And if these ideals and these values and these slogans become topical again today, it is because the worst right-wing government since the post-war period, that the country has ever known, is making them topical! To bring down the Right, there is only one way: Our vote on May 21, the victory of SYRIZA! The worst government of the Right, the government of Mr Mitsotakis, will only be defeated if SYRIZA wins this election. And we will win! You can be sure that we will win! On May 21, we will be first and by far. And we will pave the way for the formation of a government of progressive cooperation that the country needs.
