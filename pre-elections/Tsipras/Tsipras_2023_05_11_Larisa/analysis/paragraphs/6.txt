So why, if there was no national reason, she used national secrecy, Ms. Vlachou remains in her position and Justice has not officially taken a step forward? The answer, in my view, is obvious: Because the scandal of the cover-up attempted by the Mitsotakis regime was an equal scandal to that of the surveillance. The scandal of the cover-up, which was attempted through the manipulation of justice, through the manipulation of the media, through the attempted manipulation of the Independent Authorities, through the abuse of the institutions of parliamentary democracy. For nine months now, they have been raping and violating the rule of law and constitutional legitimacy, and they even have the audacity to wag their finger at us with references to democracy and constitutional legitimacy. When all over Europe Greece is becoming the black sheep.  When the day before yesterday the European Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the report of the PEGA Commission, which shows that the orchestrator of the illegal surveillance is Mr Mitsotakis himself. And the European Parliament even makes recommendations to our country. Recommendations to restore the independence of the judiciary and the independent authorities. That is what Mr Mitsotakis has reduced Greece to. Identifying with authoritarian democracies. With Mr Orban's Hungary.
