But I want to tell you, citizens of Larissa, that Mr Mitsotakis, in these elections, is accountable not only for the issues of wiretapping, illegal wiretapping and the abuse of democracy. He is also accountable in the forthcoming elections for a series of serious damage not only to democracy, but also to society. Because it is his responsibility that we had these tragic results in the pandemic. We lost 37 000 human lives. We are one of the worst countries in terms of loss of life, in proportion to our population, not only in Europe, but in the whole world. We are the worst in proportion even to Bolsonaro's Brazil. To give you an indicator for comparison, Portugal, which is a country with a similar population to that of Greece, to the population of our country, and with similar potential in terms of GDP, had 26 000 deaths. We had 37 000 deaths.  37 000 us, 26 000 Portugal.  It was a heavy price we paid.
