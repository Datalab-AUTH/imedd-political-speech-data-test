How dramatically topical is the concept of freedom, when an authoritarian parastate is brutally destroying our freedoms, even that of our communications, with malicious software and surveillance through the government building, the Maximou Mansion!And how topical is the concept of brotherhood, of the unity of our people, which is our only weapon against the difficulties we are going through. Because the unity of democratic, progressive forces and progressive citizens, the unity of the people, is what can save the people from all the suffering that is coming, from the worst government of the Right, which wants to be re-elected, but will not succeed! The time for change has come, because this is what the average Greek citizen wants today: a big change not only in the government, but in his life, in his daily life.
