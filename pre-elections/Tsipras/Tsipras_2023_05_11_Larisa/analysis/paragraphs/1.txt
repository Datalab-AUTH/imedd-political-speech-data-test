I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this overwhelming presence, for this great gathering here in Larissa. A gathering that sends a message today, not only to Thessaly, but to the whole of Greece. It sends the message of victory, it sends the message of change.  And I assure you that this is the message I want to bring you today, the message that comes from all over Greece, wherever I have been!  The message of change. These days, I am in almost every corner of our country, from Corfu to the Dodecanese and from Crete to Macedonia. And I want to assure you that the feeling of citizens everywhere, not only those who voted for SYRIZA in the last elections, even citizens who were at the ballot box for New Democracy, the feeling of everyone is, "enough is enough!" So much for obscenity!  So much for inequality!  So much for family rule! So much for indifference! Enough of arrogance! So much for injustice! Enough, in short, with this regime that has ruled us for four years. The Mitsotakis regime, which has made injustice the norm. A government that does not care about the many and a prime minister who does not feel the many and their problems.
