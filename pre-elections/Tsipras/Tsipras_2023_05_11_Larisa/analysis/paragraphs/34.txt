But I also want to address those who do not agree with us and want to vote in protest. They want, he says, to punish this government because it has made life difficult for them, because they agree with us that it is a government that has widened inequalities and injustice, but they disagree with us on some things and say, "How are we going to punish the government? By voting for any party." We respond to them: The only thing that can really punish this regime that governs us is if this regime that governs us is defeated. And the only way to defeat this regime that governs us is to defeat New Democracy. And the only way to defeat New Democracy is for Syriza to win. So, the toughest, the most punishing vote, the toughest vote of protest for what we have lived through these four years, is the vote for SYRIZA-PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE. It is the vote that will give us a clear lead next Sunday night. So that we can celebrate the great victory of the Greek people that evening and so that democratic citizens can take to the streets and celebrate on the evening of 21 May. No cartels! No the powerful! No the interests! So that the lips of the people of toil and work, the young people, can smile! So that's why I call on you, all of you, to fight this battle during these 10 days. Home to home, village to village, to convince the people of the great value of the evening of the 21st to win, to win democracy and to restore justice to our land. Justice for all, justice everywhere. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this very large gathering today in Larissa, which gives the message of victory! We will be first in Larissa, we will be first in the country. Be well! Let's go! Bye!
