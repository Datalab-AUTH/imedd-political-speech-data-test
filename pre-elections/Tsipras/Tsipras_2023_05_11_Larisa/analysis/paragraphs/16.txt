It even contradicts the OECD! Then he talks about programme costings. Those who do the costing on the breakfast channels, on Mr Avtias and the nice Mr Portosalte, that is where they do their costing. But what else has the OECD told us: That half of Greeks are in debt to the banks, to the state, to the insurance funds. 4 200 000 Greeks have bad debts. What else do we know from the data of reliable European or international organisations, from Eurostat? That private debt has increased by EUR 40 billion in the four years of Mitsotakis' four-year term. And that public debt has increased by EUR 50 billion.
