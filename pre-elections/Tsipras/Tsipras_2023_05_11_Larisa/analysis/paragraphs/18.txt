The middle class came to survive, citizens of Larissa, on vouchers, from where they would be supported, their income would rise, they would find better jobs. Vouchers for everything. Coupons for the supermarket, for gas stations, coupons for energy, to pay for electricity. And the baskets... You're in a good mood today! Indeed, the young people will say, 'better to drink a shot and not open a bottle on the beach than to vote for Mr Mitsotakis, who underestimates us, who despises us'! Because it is indeed contemptuous of the Prime Minister who targeted young people, the Prime Minister who put barriers to their access to higher education with the minimum entry basis, the Prime Minister who created a labour jungle in the labour market, with unpaid overtime.
