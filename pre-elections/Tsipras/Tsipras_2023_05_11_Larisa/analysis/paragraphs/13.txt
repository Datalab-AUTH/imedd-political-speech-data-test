But let me say the last thing for which I think Mr Mitsotakis is accountable, in view of the crisis and the verdict of the Greek people. And I believe that this is perhaps the most morally critical of all the things I am going to say, because it concerns a major crime. The crime of Tempe. It is about this unspeakable tragedy that cost the lives of 58 people. Most of them young. And among them many of your fellow citizens here in Larissa. Why? Because an untrained stationmaster, with no previous experience, was illegally appointed with a party buffet to such a critical position. Why? Because for four years the railway network has been devalued. It too was to be privatized. Why? Because the telecommunications station here in Larissa was destroyed by a fire in the summer of '19, after the elections. And no one for four years was interested in restoring it. Why? Because the railroad workers sent three letters of apology,-not one or two,-three letters of apology to the Minister of Tempe, foreshadowing and warning of the fatality to come. But they did absolutely nothing. He only brazenly shouted "shame" a few days before the accident in Parliament, to the SYRIZA MPs, when they called him out on safety, on the unsafe railway network. Perhaps, even more saddening is the way they handled the tragedy than their own responsibility for how we were led to the tragedy. The way it was handled by the Prime Minister himself, and by his ministers, putting on miserable performances in front of an antiquated console here at your station in Larissa, which they christened 'telecommand' and made the workers say one thing for another. And at the same time they were fooling the people with this hypocritical, fake resignation of the minister of Tempe, Mr. Karamanlis, who is now a candidate in Serres! Because he too wants to wash himself in the pool of Siloam.
