Friends, citizens of Larissa, in yesterday's debate of the political leaders, I believe that you all understood why Mr Mitsotakis has avoided all these years to go to a televised debate. Yesterday it turned out that his communicators were probably right. They knew a little too much that they were telling him never to go. For nine months, Mitsotakis has been diligently hiding the wiretapping scandal. And at the first tough question, he hit a storm. And he said what he hadn't dared to say the whole time before. What he hadn't been able to get away with the whole time before. So for the first time he admitted that there is a scandal, there is a real wiretapping scandal. And he admitted it publicly. But he also admitted, and this is perhaps the most important thing, that there was ultimately no national reason for the interceptions. But if there was no national reason for the interceptions, then why did he invoke national secrecy to cover up the truth in the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry? If there was no national reason for the interceptions, what exactly was the responsible prosecutor of the NSA, Ms Vlachou, signing one after another of the interception orders? She was signing illegally. And if she was signing illegally, why is it that even today, under the responsibility of Mr Mitsotakis, Mrs Vlachou remains in her position? To monitor Greek citizens indiscriminately? And above all, why, for nine months now, no charges have been brought against anyone by the Greek justice system? What exactly is Mr. Doyakos and the prosecutors who have been in charge of this investigation for nine months now doing? All they have known is to put obstacles in the way of Mr Rammos and the Independent Authority, the Independent Authority, the one empowered by the Constitution, when he tried and finally found the evidence of the crime in the telecommunications providers.
