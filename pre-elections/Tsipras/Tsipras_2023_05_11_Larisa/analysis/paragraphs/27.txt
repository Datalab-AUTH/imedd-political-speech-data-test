But I want to tell you, citizens of Larissa, that apart from the 11 articles of the Contract of Change, which we address to all democratic citizens, but we have submitted it, the progressive parties - those who call themselves progressive - should also take it into account. Because, look, simple proportional representation is fine, but you cannot just have the benefit of simple proportional representation, you have to have a basic relationship with the responsibility for how this country is going to be governed the next day. And they have to answer at some point. Are we going to be referred back to the well-remembered 'what Plastiras, what Papagos'? Will those who tell us that they are also the sole heirs to the legacy of Andreas Papandreou continue this untruthful two-front? For us, there is only one front. We have a front only with the worst right-wing government that has ruled the country since the post-war period/ To the progressive forces, we give the hand of cooperation, we have no front. So we address this 11-point programme and say to them: Tell us our views, do you agree or disagree? Tell us what else you add to this programme. If the precondition is that we initiate the procedures so that there is justice and vindication for the great bugging scandal? Yes, we accept, if that is your condition and we commit with you to put it as the 12th point. But you cannot say that it is not your business how the country is governed the next day. You cannot tell the worker, the unemployed, the student, the farmer, that it is not your concern whether Mr Mitsotakis or a progressive government with SYRIZA at its core will be in power to give hope and prospects to the dreams of young people, to the lives of the middle class and the weak.
