Mr Mitsotakis is also responsible for this unprecedented wave of obscenity that affects every Greek household. It is his responsibility that the international energy crisis and the crisis of price rationing have taken on the character of a humanitarian disaster in Greece. Our country is the leader in electricity prices, fuel prices and supermarket prices. At the same time, however, second last, together with Bulgaria, in terms of wages. Why? Because, just before this crisis started, what did Mr Mitsotakis decide? The privatisation of PPC, when he knew that the energy crisis was coming. He put the blue golden boys, the Stasi to rob consumers and share the spoils. Over 6 billion in profits for the energy and fuel companies during the crisis. 6 billion in excess profits. A large part, in fact, comes from the Greek taxpayers' own money, from the state's money, keeping VAT high, while inflation climbed over 10%, looting their income. Why? So that there is excess revenue in the public coffers and subsidies are given. But not to the citizens to go to the energy companies to keep prices high. To the refineries to keep prices high. To the supermarkets to keep prices high. This was the mechanism of obscenity and redistribution of income that Mr Mitsotakis implemented. He is also accountable for the looting of public funds. It was his responsibility that this huge robbery of more than 10 billion in direct awards and closed tenders took place, in companies that were set up three days before the tenders to be given to cronies, day labourers and the so-called - as we have called them - blue locusts. The ones that have rushed into the public wealth.
