Citizens of Larissa, I would like to say a few words on the occasion of my presence here for the world of production. I would also like to say a few words for the farmers, the stockbreeders, the people of production who are also going through very difficult times, very difficult times during the crisis. Very difficult times in these four years. And let me say that, if I am not mistaken - of course, the questions and the parallel monologues did not help - no one else remembered them yesterday, apart from the fact that I spoke in the free three minutes at the end about the agony of thousands of farmers and stockbreeders about whether they will stay in their place and continue to produce. Because with this appalling increase in energy costs, that is the great agony of the farming and livestock farming world today. So I would like to say a few words, because the timely and correct payments to farmers that we managed to achieve in the Syriza Government, something that is self-evident - but in this country, self-evident things are not self-evident - timely payments are already a thing of the past. These days, farmers should be finishing their 2023 applications in order to receive the annual payments. But they haven't even started. This is the excellence of the New Democracy government.
