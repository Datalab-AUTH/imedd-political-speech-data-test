He's also accountable for the violent redistribution of middle class wealth, which he was supposed to make a flag, remember, in the '19 elections. A violent redistribution of property, which is under way and which will come to a head if Mr Mitsotakis is re-elected - which I am sure he will not be - because he has already passed 700 000 properties to the funds; 40 billion of property, at his own risk. It is his responsibility that is taking place, and he has already begun this squeezing of families, with the auctions of first homes, commercial properties and agricultural land, for debts of a few thousand euros. At the same time, however, he has found a way to protect his party, his friends and his own officials. And that makes him doubly accountable. When his party owes 400 million in loans and unsecured loans to the banks, when his cabinet owes 12 million, when he has ministers who make arrangements for debts of millions with 50,000 euros, like Papathanasis, it is immoral to put first homes of people's houses under the hammer for 5,000 and 10,000 euros. It is immoral to see images like the one the day before yesterday in Halkidiki, of an elderly 80-year-old disabled man who was found outside his house because he was a guarantor on a loan for his unemployed son. But this is the picture we will see from now on all the time, if Mr Mitsotakis confirms this policy at the ballot box. The Patsy's were not an accident. It didn't happen, it worked! They pretend not to know who they had in their parliamentary team, but this tactic was their strategy for dealing with the red loan problem, the looting. But the time of crisis is coming.
