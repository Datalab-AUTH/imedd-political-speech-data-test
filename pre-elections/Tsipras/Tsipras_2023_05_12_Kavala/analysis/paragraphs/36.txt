If today we must keep a legacy from those who made history with these slogans, it is a legacy: that the front has always been with the right and not with the other progressive forces. So we too extend the hand of cooperation to all progressive forces, to all progressive citizens. Because we have a front only with Mr Mitsotakis and New Democracy.
