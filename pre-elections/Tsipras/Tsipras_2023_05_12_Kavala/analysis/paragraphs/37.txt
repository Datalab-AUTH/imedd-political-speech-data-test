I also want to say that simple proportional representation does not mean the end of simple logic. The party that comes first will have the first say and will be able to form a government. That is why we are addressing those citizens who want to punish Mr Mitsotakis for his government and we are saying to them: the harshest punishment for this regime that governs us is its defeat. And the defeat of the regime will come with the defeat of the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis. And the defeat of the New Democracy of Mr Mitsotakis will only come with the victory of Syriza on election night.
