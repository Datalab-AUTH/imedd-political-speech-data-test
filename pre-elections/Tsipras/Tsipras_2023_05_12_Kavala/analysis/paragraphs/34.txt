Citizens of Kavala... I don't want to leave! It is so beautiful to see you here, so beautiful to see you from above, so much strength and momentum for victory is given to us by today's gathering. But I would like to end by saying a few things that have to do with the elections themselves. You know, for us the opponent in these elections is one: it is Mr Mitsotakis' New Democracy. The front is one: the worst right-wing government the country has ever known. I have to tell you that at times it amazes me that other forces in the progressive democratic arc do not understand this. Simple proportional representation, which we will be voting for the first time this year, is a fair voting election system. Whatever we vote for is what will come out. We are proud that we did that. Fairness everywhere, fairness in voting. It has been a long-standing demand of the left, but simple proportional representation means that we take our share of the responsibility for proportional representation. It also implies responsibility for how the country is governed. We cannot hear things that are not true. The programme of the New Democracy is the same - he says - and so is the programme of Syriza, some of our left-wing comrades have told us. Is it really the same? Is it the same that the worker can be vindicated, that he has the Labour Inspectorate by his side, that he has an eight-hour working day established, that he has paid overtime? Is it the same?
