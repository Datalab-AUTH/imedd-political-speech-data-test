But it's a bit of an oxymoron that those who left the country with a 15% deficit in 2009 and led us into the memoranda, those who left the country with empty funds in '15, are blaming us and saying, "How are you going to fix the calculations and fiscal stability?" Us, who brought the country out of the memoranda. They, who have a party that owes 400 million euros in loans and unpaid debts, talking to us about costings and accounts. Too much!
