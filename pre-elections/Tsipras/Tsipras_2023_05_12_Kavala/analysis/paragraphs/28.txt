The 13th pension will be given back to the pensioners, the retroactive payments will be given as normal. Because we respect the decisions of the judiciary. The 2,000 euro salary for the first doctor will be given to the National Health System. The increases in the basic salary and the three-year increments will be thawed, the increases for civil servants, for the first time in 14 years, at 10% will be given as normal. Everything in our programme will be given as planned. They are measured, they are costed, they are realistic.
