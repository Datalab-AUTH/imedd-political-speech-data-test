Friends, I want to make it clear: there is no country in Europe where something like this has happened, where the high priest of the state, the orchestrator of the state, the prime minister, could stay in his position for even one hour. Illegal surveillance is banned and prosecuted everywhere in Europe, and the same in America. And there is a rule, you know, in all Western democracies. If you respect the Constitution and the laws, you stay. If you violate the Constitution and the laws, you leave.
When you get caught and if you get caught with a goat on your back, if you have no dignity, you stay. If you have dignity, you leave. On your own, you go. In any other European democracy, this admission the day before yesterday by the Prime Minister on a public frequency, on a nationwide frequency, that there was no national reason for the wiretapping would have led to resignation. However, not only is Mr Mitsotakis not resigning, but he is claiming, through the vote of the Greek people, to wash away his blunders. And yes, we will do what you say: you will resign him with your vote, the Greek people will resign him on 21 May, the Greek people will do justice and bring democracy back to power.
