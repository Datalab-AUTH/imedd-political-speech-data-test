But I also want to address the conservative citizens, your fellow citizens with whom we have ideological and political differences, but we respect them, who vote for New Democracy, but are ashamed of this decline of their party. Because it is a party with a history, which today is governed by a holy family, just as it governs the country. I want to address them and ask them: will your vote wash away Mr Mitsotakis' blunders against democracy itself? Will you be complicit in this crime?
But I would also like to take this opportunity to address Mr Androulakis, who for the first time I heard him so clearly the other day calling for the need for those responsible for the parastatal to be held accountable to justice - he even spoke of prison. And I ask him: it is reasonable for him to call for this, but does he really believe that this can happen with a New Democracy government of Mr Mitsotakis? Obviously it will never happen with a Mitsotakis government. Therefore, if he really believes - and I believe him in this - that those responsible must be held to account, let him leave the unhistorical bipartisans alone. Only with a progressive government will the perpetrators of the parastate be held to account, democratic legitimacy will be restored, and Greece will become a normal European country again.
