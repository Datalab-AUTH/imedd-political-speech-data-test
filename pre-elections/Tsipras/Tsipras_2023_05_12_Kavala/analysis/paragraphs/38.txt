I would like to say a few words about Kavala, in the same context and in the same climate about its problems, addressing again the progressive and democratic citizens and the progressive forces: do we care whether on Monday of the elections we will have a government that will deal with the big problems of your country or do we not mind and let us have the government of Mr.Mitsotakis again to expand them, to make these problems even bigger? Are we going to do something for the young people of the region, half of whom are unemployed? Will we do something to vindicate the struggle of the fertiliser and oil workers, for the state to respect the decisions of the judiciary and for private companies to respect the decisions of the judiciary?
