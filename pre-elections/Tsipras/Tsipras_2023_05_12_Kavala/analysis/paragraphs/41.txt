Give us the opportunity, the first opportunity to govern on our programme. Because in 15-19 we took the country out of the memoranda, we worked honestly, we worked honestly, nobody can blame us for a single euro, but we did not govern according to our programme. We made necessity a philanthropy, a national obligation. We did it. But we did not govern according to our programme.Now is the first time that we will have the opportunity to govern not with our "musts" but with our "wants". Give us that first chance. We know and we can bring real change to people's lives.
