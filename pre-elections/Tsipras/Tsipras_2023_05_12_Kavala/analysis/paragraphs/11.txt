According to the data that we have in our hands from the OECD, we are the only country in Europe where from '19 to '21, over the three years, the average nominal wage fell. And in the only three countries in Europe that in 2022 the average real wage fell by 7.5%. And here comes the prime minister, who managed to make our country one of the few countries in Europe where the wage - the average wage, mind you - fell, to tell us that it will reach 1,500 euros in 2028. Who is he kidding, really? The reality we live in today can be described by the following expression: we live on Bulgarian wages but at British prices. This is the Greece of Mr Mitsotakis. And how else, my friends, has income redistribution been achieved over the years, apart from wage restraint? With subsidies to obscenity. That's how it was done.
