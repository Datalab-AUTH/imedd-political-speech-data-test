And I want to remind you what Mr Mitsotakis promised in 2019: support for the middle class, better wages, better jobs and an executive -again!- state. And what did he do four years later? He made the rich richer, that's what he achieved. But the poor poorer and the middle poorer.  He reduced the middle class to living on food stamps. Vouchers to go to the supermarket, vouchers to put gas in the car, vouchers to pay for electricity. Income ends in the 3rd week of the month for most families, most households, overtime is unpaid, the eight-hour day is gone. Where are the best jobs?
