But today we have a reality to deal with. Because four years later, what is he leaving behind? A country that has 50 billion more public debt in these four years. A country that has 40 billion more private debt in these four years and almost half of the Greeks - look, 4,250,000 Greeks, half of Greece - are in debt, have bad debts to the banks, to the tax authorities, to the social security funds. And 700,000 households are worried that tomorrow they will lose their house in the auctions. Because 700,000 mortgaged houses are currently in the hands of the funds of Mr Mitsotakis' friends, such as Mr Patsis, who had him in his parliamentary team and did exactly this job. He was a crow, going around taking people's lives, threatening them that he would take their house so that he could take and make a profit from their debts.
In these four years, friends, we have seen the greatest redistribution of income from the many to the powerful and the day laborers, with accuracy galloping, with the average wage falling, with indirect taxation reaping the harvest.
