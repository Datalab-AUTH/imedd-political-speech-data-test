How much did the devaluation of the welfare state, the devaluation of the OSE that led to the tragedy of the Tempi River cost in terms of money? How much did all this cost in money? How much did unpaid overtime really cost? How much does the black labour of young people cost? How much does all this cost?
The cost is incalculable and tragically measurable, our very lives.
That is why I want to make this clear today: No matter how much they terrorise us, no matter how much they try to terrorise the people, we will not comply with their suggestions.
