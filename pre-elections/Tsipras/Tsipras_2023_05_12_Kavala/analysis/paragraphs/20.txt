The Prime Minister himself is also responsible because he came out and said "I didn't know". In all the critical things he told us "I didn't know". He didn't know who was watching half the political system in the office next to him. He didn't know that Mrs Mendoni had appointed Mr Lignadi. He didn't know what Mr Karamanlis was doing to the railways. He didn't know what Mr. Patsis was doing. He didn't know what Mrs. Nikolaou was doing. What did this prime minister really know? An irresponsible prime minister! An irresponsible ruler and a hypocrite. A prime minister who doesn't care. But he knew very well how to put Mr Karamanlis back on the New Democracy ballot paper, he knew that. He resigned for 30 days to avoid trouble and then came back with the promise of possibly becoming a minister again.
