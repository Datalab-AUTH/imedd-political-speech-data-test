I want to thank you warmly, to thank you for your passion, for your presence, for your fighting spirit. And I must tell you how happy and joyful I feel every time I come to this city. It is a part of my childhood memories, half of my heart belongs here to you, to beautiful Kavala, to your place, to our place. I also want to say that it is a pleasure and an honour for me to be here in this place, which, apart from being a place of personal memories, is also a place of great struggles. Because we cannot forget that Kavala is synonymous with the working class, the city of the tobacco worker, the city that has fought and struggled for decades, in dark and difficult times.
The city where the first big strike in the Balkans took place in 1896. But also the city that today is re-coloured with the colour of the struggle of the workers in the fertiliser and oil industries of Kavala. A struggle of which we are all proud, a struggle that we want to be vindicated and we are committed to vindicate. A struggle for work and dignity. Work and dignity! Yes, we are not asking for anything more, but we will only win this dignity through struggle and through our vote on 21 May. I want us all to shout this slogan nine days from today. On May 21, with the result of the elections, our people should celebrate, the cartels and the powerful should not celebrate, the interests should not celebrate. That is why we are seeking and we believe that we will certainly succeed in achieving a great victory for SYRIZA, which will mean a victory for the people and a victory for democracy.
