Citizens of Kavala, I think your gathering today is a very big message, a strong message to those who think that these elections will be a walk in the park for the forces that have made our lives black. In this election we will see a better day. I see it here today in your rally, in your faces. It is a big surprise to me that this is a big rally, bigger than any other rally we have had here in Kavala. And it is a response to those who cannot recognize that SYRIZA has deep roots in society. That SYRIZA on May 21 can be first and by far and make the hope for a great change in this country a reality.
