Pensioners are now without dignity. He was supposedly saying that what SYRIZA was giving was peanuts, but he took away the 13th pension that we introduced when we came out of the memoranda and abolished it, he never gave the retroactive pension, despite the decision of the Council of State. 7 billion less to pensioners in these four years. But, most importantly, a pension of 700 euros four years ago had 40% more purchasing power. Today, this pension is not even enough for electricity, rent, basic obligations. So, the workaholics are plunged into insecurity, because today they cannot afford even a single gift for their grandchildren, and this life of insecurity is not worth it, neither for the workaholics nor for the young people. For none of our fellow citizens is this prospect of destitution worth it.
