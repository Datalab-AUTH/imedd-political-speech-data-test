He is finally responsible for a state that cannot provide basic security for its citizens. Because for four years they have been telling us that they are digitising the state, but they have not managed to do the obvious: to be able to check that two trains have been running opposite each other on the same track for 12 consecutive minutes. And of course their great responsibility is not only because they devalued the railway, not only because they illegally appointed the stationmaster with party buffoonery, but also because they tried to abdicate their responsibilities. Because the Minister of Tempe had received three letters of apology from the workers who had foretold the tragedy. And why a few days before, in Parliament, he was answering the SYRIZA MPs and saying "Shame on you for telling me that there is a safety issue".They are responsible because in the following days they tried to hide their responsibilities by lying that there was supposedly a TV station in Larissa. Do you remember? And ministers were going and putting on performances in front of antiquated consoles, supposedly saying that this was a TV station.
