Over â‚¬10 billion in a year and a half in subsidies to electricity companies and as much more in direct awards and closed tenders. But the plan also foresees that in the next four years we will experience the biggest redistribution of property the country has ever experienced since World War II, with 700,000 auctions. And the question is, I address it to you, but it's rhetorical. I address it to every citizen, because this is our life, it's not about what party we are. Are we going to let Mr Mitsotakis implement this plan for another four years, the biggest redistribution? I did not hear you well, what did you say? Are we going to let him? How are we going to stop him? With our vote we will prevent him. With the victory of Syriza we will prevent him, with the victory of Syriza on 21 May we will prevent him.
