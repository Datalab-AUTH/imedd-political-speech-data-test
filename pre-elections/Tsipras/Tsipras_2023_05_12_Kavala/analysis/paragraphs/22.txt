Citizens of Kavala, a few days ago we publicly presented the contract of SYRIZA with the democratic citizens, the Contract of Change. Our programme. A program that we address simultaneously to all democratic progressive forces, so that after SYRIZA's victory on the 22nd of this month, it will be the basis of the discussion for the formation of a progressive government that will bring change in our lives. This contract has 11 articles, but one basic condition. Its basic condition is justice. Justice for all - justice everywhere.
