Mr Mitsotakis, who came to your city a few days ago, shook his head, "remove the verbs", he did not answer. We give a clear answer: the laws of the Greek courts will be respected by everyone in this country. Will we also do something about the great question of Health? In the region only 38% of the organic posts are filled by permanent staff in hospitals. Will we do something about those people who were on the front line of the pandemic at the risk of their lives and then hypocritically some people applauded them, but then forgot about them? Are we going to do something to make them permanent, just as we have a moral obligation to contract and auxiliary doctors?
Will we do something about the Mental Health Centre that is without a permanent doctor? Will we do something about the one and only TUMY (Local Health Unit) that does not have the necessary staff? Will we do something about the farmers who are ripping up their vines? For the farmers who are killing their female animals to keep their herds from breeding and have nothing to feed them? Are we going to do something about these people? These are the big questions.
