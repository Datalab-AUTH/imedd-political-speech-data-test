We address all democratic, left-wing, progressive citizens and we tell them that it is very important who will govern the country for another four years. It matters little, perhaps, to those who are only interested in keeping their powers and making things worse for the people so that they can say 'we told you so'. But the people do not want to have it worse so that they can say 'we told you so'. The people want to see a white day in their lives, they want to see a better life, a better outlook. That's what the people want to see.
We also appeal to the other side, to those who accuse us these days of having stolen their slogans. The same things that the left said to Andreas in the 1980s. Listen to one thing: life gives birth to slogans and when some slogans become topical, they become topical because life makes them topical. And no one has the intellectual property of slogans. They belong to the whole democratic, progressive Party of the country. If today the demand for change becomes topical again, it is because we again have the worst government of the right that we have seen since the post-war period.
