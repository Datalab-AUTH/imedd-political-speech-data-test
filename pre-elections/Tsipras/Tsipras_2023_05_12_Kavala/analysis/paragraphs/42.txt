With these thoughts I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your overwhelming presence here today. With these thoughts I would like to ask you for just one favour in these nine days ahead of us. And the favour I ask of you is that with the same fighting spirit, with the same optimism that you have accompanied our meeting today, you should continue in the coming days to stand by the people who are standing undecided, by the people who have not yet taken the big decision and tell them: Now is the time for change. Now is the time for a decision, now is the time for SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance.I call on you in every village, in every neighbourhood, until the elections, to make the message of victory that you have sent today throughout Greece, a decision to vote for the great victory on May 21, so that in the evening the people, not the cartels, will be celebrating, and not the cartels. So that change can be made real with your vote. Thank you very much for your presence here today. You have given the message of victory, you have given the message of change. Kavala today is opening up, showing the way. This is the biggest rally we have ever had! And that says a lot.
Goodbye and with victory!
