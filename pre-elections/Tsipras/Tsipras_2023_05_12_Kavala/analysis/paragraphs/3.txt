Citizens of Kavala, what I think everyone is expecting today, because many people say - of course they were saying this before they saw your gathering today - that "the climate of this election is more subdued than in other elections". But what every citizen - and I can assure you of this, I have been all over the country these days - is that something will finally change in their lives. The basic feeling for every citizen, whether they voted for us or for other parties in the last election, whether they are left-wing or right-wing or centrist, the basic feeling, if they are not privileged, of course, if they do not have a vested interest in believing that things should continue as they are, the basic feeling for the majority of citizens is one: Enough is enough! No more obscenity. No more arrogance. No more of this indifference. Enough with family rule. Enough with injustice. This is the basic feeling from coast to coast all over the country. And this feeling has to do with the fact that for four years now injustice has become the status quo in our country.
