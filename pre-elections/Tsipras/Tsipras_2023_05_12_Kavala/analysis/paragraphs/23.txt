And to tell you briefly, four things - let me leave you with this - this contract, this programme, provides for four things: Raising wages, lowering prices, settling debts, a fair, efficient, strong, social state alongside the citizen. These are the four basic conditions of this contract. We are told by our political opponents: "It won't work, we cost it, it won't work, you can be sure it won't work". They have also sent it to the General Accounting Office, another lie. I want to answer them today: what you say is not coming off has nothing to do with its actual cost. It has to do with the fact that our programme does indeed have a cost, but for them and for those interests that you support and that support you.
