We want to do something about all this, not fight about who owns the copyright of the slogans. That's what we want to do something about. We are addressing everyone, first and foremost we are addressing the Greek people, the citizens of Kavala, regardless of what they voted for in the previous elections, and we are telling them one thing: Give with your vote to SYRIZA and with SYRIZA's victory a mandate to form a government of progressive cooperation, with a mandate to deal with these daily, big, social problems that concern you.
