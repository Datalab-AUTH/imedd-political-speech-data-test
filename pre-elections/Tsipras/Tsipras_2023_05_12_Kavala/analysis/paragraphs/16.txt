But it is not only the wiretapping, there are many crimes that have been committed in these four years and Mr Mitsotakis has a lot of responsibility. He is responsible for the tragic handling of the pandemic. We lost 37 000 of our fellow citizens, so that you realise that it is the proportion of the population that plays the crucial role, which is why, compared to our population, this figure ranks us among the worst countries in the western world. We have surpassed Bolsonaro's Brazil. Portugal, which has a similar population to ours, has 26 000 casualties, we have 37 000 casualties. And there is responsibility for that. There is responsibility for the endless lies about the cover-up, for telling us that it is the same to be admitted in intensive care units as outside, because there is no data. While he had in his drawers the studies of the Professors, Mr Tsiodra and Mr Lytra. So he is responsible for that.
