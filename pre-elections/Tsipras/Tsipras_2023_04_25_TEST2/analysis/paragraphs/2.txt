I want to begin my speech here today in front of you by recalling an old rhizitiko, the most characteristic of your land, which we always sing at all great struggles. Why should I remember it? Because I think it is what millions of our fellow citizens all over Greece are asking themselves: "When will it ever be clear!" So I bring you a message, because I am in almost all corners of our country these days and I meet citizens, regardless of what they voted for, and they come to me and say, "That's it! It is time for things to change!" I bring you the message that on 21 May it will be a new dawn in our country. And the next day will be a new day for democracy, for justice, for our country. The dawn of change is coming, and I think your gathering today is proof of that. It is a message that today's gathering is a message. And it is a message because it can be directly compared to previous rallies that have taken place in this place and we don't have the stage effects. We are more in the squares, we are more in the streets, we will be more at the polls.
