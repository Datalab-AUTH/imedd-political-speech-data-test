It is a realistic goal the debt settlement that we announced and described in detail a few days ago with the co-signature of the woman politician who linked her name with the protection of the first home, the middle class and the weak in Greece during the difficult years of the memoranda, Lucas Katseli. Is it realistic? We say yes, it is realistic. By protecting the first home, commercial housing and agricultural land, with transparency, taxation and control over the activity and transactions of funds. With 120 instalments and the cancellation of part of the nominal value of the debt, as we did for the debts to the insurance funds of freelancers in 2018, we will give breath, but we will also enable the economy to function. Because as long as these debts keep piling up, no one and nothing will move forward. No one will be paying back.
