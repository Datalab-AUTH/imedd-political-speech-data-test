We didn't create this state, the state with buffet, with corruption, with corruption, with corruption. We did not create this public debt. We left in '19 a debt regulated and 356 billion in public debt. It has now gone to 400 billion, four years of Mitsotakis' government. We found ourselves in the most difficult times that the Greek economy and the country found itself in the previous administration. And we had an obligation to make sacrifices to get the country out of the swamp that others have thrown it into. To settle the debt that others have accumulated and to collect 37 billion in the Public Treasury. That's how much we left. The others left it empty. We didn't put that money in our pockets, in our accounts, we didn't funnel it to some offshore. We don't have offshore companies, others have offshore companies. We have a clean political record. We have made mistakes, but in the service of good policy. We made mistakes and we learned from them. But we also left the public funds full, and the debt regulated, and Greece out of the memoranda and in the markets with twelve quarters of growth.
