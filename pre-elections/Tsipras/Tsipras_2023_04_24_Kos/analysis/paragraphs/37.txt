Direct contracts, benefits to big interests, selling off even water, which is a public good, are realistic for them. But when it comes to pro-people measures, measures to relieve the great majority, they are quick to put the label on it: "It's not realistic". And they tell us supposedly, they're bringing the boogeyman of bankruptcy that they brought us, who bankrupted this country in 2009 and 2015? Which party bankrupted the country?The party that got the country out of bankruptcy and that managed to get the country's neck out of the water - I say this metaphorically - is now coming to wag their finger at us and tell us that what we are saying is not realistic.But they have a disadvantage, you know: The day before yesterday I came back from Berlin where I met Chancellor Scholz.
