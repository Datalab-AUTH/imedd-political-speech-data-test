But the worst blow of this four-year term is that Mr Mitsotakis has struck at the pride and dignity of all those he is supposed to save: The so-called middle class. Remember how we were accused when we were supporting the weak that we were doing subsidy policies and redistributing poverty at the expense of the middle class? Well, those who accused us then of subsidy policies have reduced the middle class to living on food stamps. Coupons at the supermarket, coupons to go to the petrol station, coupons to pay for electricity. But that is their ultimate goal. That, you know, it didn't work, it worked. Because that's where their program for the next four years leads. Widening inequality and squeezing the middle down. To put it simply, there's no room for a middle class in their plan. There is no room for the middle class and small and medium-sized entrepreneurship in the resources of the Recovery Fund, which will go to a few conglomerates by word of mouth and agreement. There is no place for the middle class when the cartels have to make excess profits from food, fuel and services. There is no room for the middle class when you have to work without hours, black and undeclared, supposedly to make Greece competitive and supposedly to bring in investment. There is no room for the middle class. There is no room for the grassroots. There is no room for young people, for young people, for pensioners. So it is time to put an end to this artificial normality of the most unformed, the most provocative, the most vulgar, I would say, injustice.
