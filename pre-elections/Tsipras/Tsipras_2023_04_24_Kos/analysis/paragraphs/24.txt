But let's look at the measures we are proposing one by one and see: are they realistic? Is it a realistic objective to increase the basic wage to EUR 880 and to introduce an annual indexation so that every year, if inflation goes up, the wage goes up? We say, yes, it is realistic. Because this will not only support thousands of households, but it will stimulate demand, it will revitalize the market, it will create jobs.Is it a realistic goal to increase, after 14 years of not seeing an increase for civil servants, by 10% when inflation has risen by more than 10% in recent years? We say, yes, it is, it's realistic. Because the economy can bear it. With 10 billion shared between them in direct awards, it would be enough for decent salaries in the public sector for many years to come, not just one year. But decent salaries in the public sector mean more productivity, better relations with the citizen, and of course stimulation of demand and the market.
