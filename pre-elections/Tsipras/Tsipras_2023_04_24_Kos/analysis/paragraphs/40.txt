But I said before that Mr Mitsotakis is very afraid and he shows it. He is so afraid that he does not dare to come to a television debate opposite me, face to face. On the one hand he says that the dilemma of the elections is Mitsotakis or Tsipras, but on the other hand he refuses to come and compare us, to develop our arguments in front of the Greek people. He is hiding!
