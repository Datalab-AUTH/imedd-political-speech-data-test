So I have here today in Kos to bring to all of you, citizens of Kos, of the Dodecanese, news about Mr Mitsotakis, who is afraid as the days go by and we reach the crisis of the people, he is very afraid and he shows it: So the time and the day of change is coming. The day is coming when the voices of all will unite. The voices of the people who have unjustly lost their own people in the pandemic. We are the country with the worst death toll in proportion to our population.
