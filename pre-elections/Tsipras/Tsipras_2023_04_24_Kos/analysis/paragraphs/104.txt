And I want you to ask yourself? If instead of having the obligation to raise 40, we had the discretion to spend 60, where would the country be now? What would be the result? What would the balance sheet be? Rest assured that our hospitals would have stood on their feet, social cohesion would have been strengthened, wages and pensions would have seen increases, the weak would have seen a white day, the welfare state would have been there to support you, and we would have had a better future.
