Friends, citizens of Kos, less than a month is left from the day when we all expect that the people, with their vote, will take the big step towards justice and change. The day when they will say a decisive no to the regime of inexactitude, scandals, interceptions and corruption. To the Mitsotakis regime. And the big and decisive yes to SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance and the progressive government. And I am sure that nothing will be the same in this country on the evening of May 21. Greece will leave behind four difficult, four hard years. It will leave behind insecurity, worry, anxiety and will take a first but decisive step towards hope and certainty. The first step towards justice everywhere in this country. It is this thought, this vision, that I see is mobilising more and more people in every corner of our country, wherever I have been in recent days, from one end to the other. Because Greek society is moving every day from scepticism, from reflection, from anger, to decision. And from decision to participation. We know. We can. We will get Greece out of this swamp. And I want to tell you that this is a pinnacle moment, the moment of the people's verdict, above all the unity of a people. A people united by two words inscribed in its very identity. One word is our national anthem itself. And the other is the reason why this people is known from all over the world. One word is Freedom, the second word is Democracy. Freedom and Democracy. Freedom and democracy always lead us to the great dilemmas of the times. They have too many struggles, too many sacrifices, too much history behind them for anyone to desecrate them and subordinate them to personal self-interest.
