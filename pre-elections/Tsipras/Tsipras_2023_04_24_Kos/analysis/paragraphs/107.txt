So we can. The diptych of our realism is: We know - we can. So when people tell us that Syriza wants a second chance, we answer them: We want the first chance to govern on the basis of our own plan, on the basis of our own programme, on the basis of our own strategy. And this will be an opportunity not only for SYRIZA, but also for Greece, for Greek society.
