And we say that we know and we can. We know, because we are more experienced than ever, we know how to make it happen. In a safe way, with a clear sense of the context, with realism. But what are they telling us? They keep telling us 'what you are proposing is not realistic, where will you get the money? Direct awards, benefits to big interests, selling off even water, which is a public good, are realistic for them. But when it comes to pro-people measures, measures to relieve the great majority, they are quick to put the label on: "It's not realistic". And they tell us, they are supposedly bringing back the boogeyman of bankruptcy that they brought us, which bankrupted this country in 2009 and 2015? Which party bankrupted this country? The party that brought the country out of bankruptcy and that managed to get the country's neck out of the water - I say this metaphorically - is now coming to wag their finger at us and tell us that what we are saying is not realistic. But they have one drawback, you know: The day before yesterday I came back from Berlin where I met Chancellor Scholz. I came from Berlin after I met with Schäuble, after I met with him from Berlin, after I met with Schäuble from Berlin, after I met with him from Berlin.
