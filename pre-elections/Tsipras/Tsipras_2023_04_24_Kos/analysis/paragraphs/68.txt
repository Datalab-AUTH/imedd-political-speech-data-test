I want to tell you something: We are not only going strong to get rid of the right-wing, but to get rid of the worst right-wing government that has ever ruled the country. It's not just right-wing. It is a limited liability company, as the late Gennimata said. She first said it. "Maximou Inc." she said. "Mitsotakis Inc." I will say. It's the family name of the limited liability company.
