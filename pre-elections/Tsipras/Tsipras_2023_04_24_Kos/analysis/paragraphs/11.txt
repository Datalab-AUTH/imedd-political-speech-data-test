But I said before that Mr Mitsotakis is very afraid and he shows it. He is so afraid that he does not dare to come to a television debate opposite me, face to face. On the one hand he says that the dilemma of the elections is Mitsotakis or Tsipras, but on the other hand he refuses to come and compare us, to develop our arguments in front of the Greek people. He is hiding! He wants to glorify himself by hiding. Or rather by being stoned by the journalists of his choice. Because it is understandable that he wants to hide from me, I understand. But hiding from journalists too? Choosing which anchorwoman to interview on the TV stations, lest he be asked anything outside of his own little tricks? This is the first time I've ever seen such a prime minister so scared. Is his confidence that low? If it's so low, why don't they give him two or three polls with a 15 point lead? Because when they give him 5-6 he gets nervous. But he did put out a campaign TV spot today. He dressed up as Syriza and told us that he wants better wages, an efficient state and a better NHS. Really, and for four years who has been running this country? His double? Why did he make things worse and now he tells us 'vote for me to make things better'? Who does he think he is fooling? Soon he'll be throwing away his tie and shouting "Justice everywhere"!
