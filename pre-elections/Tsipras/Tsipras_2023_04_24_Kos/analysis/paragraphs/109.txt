But there is an important precondition for all this, a first important step that will change the status quo and the acquired speed of a policy that leaves behind a disastrous landscape. And this step - and I say this neither as a figure of speech nor to vote for, nor to exclude the choice of citizens to a looser vote - I say it because this is the reality, I say it because the elections of proportional representation are not the elections of looser voting. They produce governments. On May 21, we will have correlations that can produce a government without having to go to a second or third political election of instability, uncertainty and adventure for the country. So the precondition is that on the evening of 21 May, SYRIZA - Progressive Alliance must be first, clearly first at the ballot box, in the popular verdict.
