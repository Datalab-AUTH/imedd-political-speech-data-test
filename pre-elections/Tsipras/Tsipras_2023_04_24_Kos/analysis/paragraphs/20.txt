"I don't know" is the candy they keep saying. He did not know about Turkaegean, he did not know about the Tsiodra report, he did not know about the mortality rate in intensive care units, he did not know about the interceptions taking place in the office next door to him, he did not know, he said recently, about the railway disaster that led to the deaths of 57 of our fellow citizens. He didn't know what Mr. Patsy was doing, who was a crow and was taking people's homes. He didn't know that Mrs Mendoni appointed his chosen one to the National Theatre, Mr Lignadi. He didn't know anything. Ignorant. The clueless prime minister.
