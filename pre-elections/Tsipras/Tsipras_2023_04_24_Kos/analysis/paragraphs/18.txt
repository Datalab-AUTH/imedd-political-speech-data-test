It is also not possible that in the last year alone we have 4.5 billion in excess revenues in the Public Treasury from indirect taxes and the consistently high VAT. Why? It is all over Europe, with this high inflation, they have reduced VAT. Here even today we have 14% inflation on food. But with the high VAT they fill the public coffers. And where does this money go? Where do these subsidies go? They go to the cartels to keep prices high and continue to get rich. This is the looting, the redistribution of income that has been targeted over the years. This is the Greece of the aristocrats, this is the famous, as they called it, "Greece 2.0". Where zero is for the many. For the few, the powerful, and 2 and 3 and 13. As long as it is the multiplication of their profits. But their plan, my friends, has not only economic and social consequences. For as long as the country is governed in this way, without control, without accountability, with arrogance and deals, there are even greater dangers.
