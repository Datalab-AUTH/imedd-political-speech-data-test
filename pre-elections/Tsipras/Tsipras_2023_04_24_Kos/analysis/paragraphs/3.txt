I am very happy and excited to be here in Kos, in the Dodecanese. I know, and you know, that this invitation today, this democratic invitation, this very nice gathering, is missing a piece of our heart, a man, a great comrade who loved his country, who served his principles and ideas with vigour and dedication for his whole life: Nektarios Santorinios, whom we lost recently, and who, as Minister of Island Policy, did very important things for the Dodecanese and all the islands.
