I heard Mr Mitsotakis say in the last few days that the simple proportional representation is a trap for SYRIZA. And it does not, he says, harm New Democracy, but it harms democracy itself. And I wonder: I wonder how much fear this opinion exudes? How much fear in the face of the sovereign people. Because what does it mean, other than fear, when a Prime Minister, indeed, who is supposed to enjoy the esteem of the people, denounces the simplest and most honest electoral system that has ever existed, the electoral system that ensures the authentic expression of political correlations, the equal participation of citizens in decisions, the fairness of the vote? The truth is simple. That's how they've gotten comfortable for decades. They said they had self-ruling governments when in reality they had minority governments in the Greek people. That's how they've been comfortable for decades. Miserable policies imposed by miserable means and with the people participating as little as, once every four years. As much as it takes to perpetuate their power. So it is this "as much as" of the governments of the arrogant, supposedly self-reliant but minority governments, that has brought Greece to the rocks. It was autocratic governments that bankrupted us. It was autocratic governments that arrogantly drove society to the brink of despair. So instead of the political system being trained in dialogue and cooperation, in respect for the will of the people, our people should have been trained in the distortion of their will.
