Mr Mitsotakis leaves behind a society that has seen its income shrink. It has seen its life shrink. In wages that evaporate like never before in the first fortnight of the month. In rent, in electricity, in fuel, in the supermarket. It leaves behind a state that has not only done nothing to protect its citizens from injustice, but has become the protector of cartels and obscenity. It is leaving behind executives who were elected by the Greek people to represent them, and they were running to take people's houses at auctions, such as the well-known Mr Patsis, its MP until recently. He leaves behind him the good fellows of the party-state, those who fell like locusts in '19, to take revenge for having been five years out of the public purse.
