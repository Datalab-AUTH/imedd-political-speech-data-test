Justice must be everywhere. In the economy, in society, in the state. Justice is the cornerstone of the Greece we want to build. Because the Greece that we have lived these four years does not deserve anyone who lives, works, studies, dreams with honesty and dignity in this country.So I have news for all of you, citizens of Kos, of the Dodecanese, here in Kos today, about Mr Mitsotakis, who is afraid as the days go by and we reach the crisis of the people, he is very afraid and he shows it: So the time and the day of change is coming; the day is coming when the voices of all will unite. The voices of people who have unjustly lost their own people in the pandemic. We are the country with the worst death rate in proportion to our population.The time has come to unite the voices of those who work unpaid 12-hour days, those whose lives are being dominated by debt collectors, those whose homes are in imminent danger of being auctioned off because the first home is no longer protected.These young children with dreams for tomorrow and determination for life, who are in their homes these days, studying, working hard because they are competing in the national exams and dreaming of tomorrow. But they also have the right to vote and we need to talk to these children. To give perspective, to give a future, to listen to what they have to say.So the time has come for all these voices from all over the country to come together and say two words: Enough! No more injustice, no more obscenity, no more indecency, no more dignity, no more!And I can say more beside the injustice, the obscenity, the indecency.
