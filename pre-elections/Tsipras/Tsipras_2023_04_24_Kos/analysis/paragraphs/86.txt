Is it a realistic goal to reduce prices? Yes, it is realistic. By reducing VAT on food and essentials. In Spain, in other countries they have even introduced zero VAT on consumer goods and foodstuffs. Also by reducing the VAT on fuel to the lowest possible level provided for by the European Union and by abolishing the VAT on agricultural oil.
