That is why I urge you, from today until the polls, in the next 30 days, not to waste any time. Let's get together house by house, neighborhood by neighborhood, talk to people. We don't have the media to do propaganda for us. But we do have the arguments. We have our clear and honest political speech; we have our proposals. We have our programme!
