Hello citizens of Menidi! I want to say a big thank you for your warm welcome. And I want to say that I am touched to be here, in the heart of the Pontian return, where the heart of the Pontian Hellenism in Attica beats, where I am facing our fellow citizens. And, of course, for the great honour and pleasure of being introduced by a Pontian - and what a Pontian! - Poppy Tsapanidou, so that we can talk together today, both about the crucial election contest before us, but also about what justice can mean for the thousands of our fellow citizens who came back from the former Soviet Union, and about what justice towards history can mean. What Pontian Hellenism deserves.
