And I want to assure you today, the victory of SYRIZA will not only come and will surprise all those who pretend not to see what is happening around them and only see the fabricated poll bars on the news. But SYRIZA's victory will be a big one. It will be a strong mandate that we will receive from you, from the people who are looking for justice on the night of May 21. And the stronger the victory, the more certain the formation of a government of progressive cooperation the day after the elections.
