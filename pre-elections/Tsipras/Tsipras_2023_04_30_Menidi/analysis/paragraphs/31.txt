So that is why I want to pledge today, here in Menidi, that with the new regulation that we will bring, the fines, the surcharges and all kinds of interest that are charged on the loans of the returning Pontus refugees, the loans relating to their homes, will be cancelled. And from then on, the rest of the loan will be arranged for repayment in 240 interest-free instalments, with a maximum instalment of 100 euros per month. Because we want to put into practice this promise, which since 2000 the Greek state gave to our fellow citizens who came from the Soviet Union.
