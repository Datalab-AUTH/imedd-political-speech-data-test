It is not fair that Greece is at the bottom of the league table in wages but at the top of the league table in supermarket prices across Europe. It is not justice that tens of thousands of their own people should lose their lives in a rail accident that is clearly due to a lack of concern for public infrastructure and people's safety, and that the Prime Minister should rush to blame the tragedy on the stationmaster. But who? The one they themselves bribed into the job, untrained and without experience.
