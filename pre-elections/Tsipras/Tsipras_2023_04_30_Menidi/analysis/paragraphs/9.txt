We therefore honour the history of Pontic Hellenism that begins in the times of myth and the first Greek colonisations, when the "rough" Pontus, i.e. the inhospitable sea, was transformed into a hospitable one, i.e. the Black Sea. During this period the Greeks created more than 70 cities and towns throughout its periphery. But the region which over the centuries will have the most consistent historical continuity and massiveness in terms of population will be the Asia Minor Pontos. It is there that the city-states will first be established, and in the Middle Ages it will constitute "deep Greece", as the Kingdom of Pontus is referred to by Arab chroniclers. And there, in 1204, the empire of Trabzon, of the great Komnenoi, will be created. But even after the fall of Trebizond to the Ottoman Empire, 8 years after the fall of Constantinople, Pontian Hellenism will remain alive and will rise again in the second half of the 19th century.
