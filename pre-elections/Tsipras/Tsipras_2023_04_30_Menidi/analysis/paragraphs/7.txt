But let me say that justice is not only about the issues that I have mentioned, the issues of the economy, the issues of society, the institutions. The issue of justice is first and foremost about our dignity. Justice means first and foremost respect for who each of us is and what each of us represents. Respect for the history that each of us and individually all of us together have. Practical respect, respect in action and not in words.
