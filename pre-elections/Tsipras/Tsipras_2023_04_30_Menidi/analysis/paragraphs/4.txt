And, to put it in your own language, the Pontian language, some zha were broken and others were marukundan. So we cannot go on like this, the government washing its hands, relying on the market to supposedly solve our problems or, even worse, supporting obscenity. We are told that the crisis is imported. But the obscenity is Greek and it has the signature of the government of Mr Mitsotakis. And of course, it is not fair to keep indirect taxation, VAT, the special tax on fuel at these high levels when prices are going up. Because it is one thing for someone with an income of EUR 700, 800, 1 500 to pay the same tax, but it is another thing for someone with an income of EUR 3 000, 4 000 and 5 000. So that is not justice.
