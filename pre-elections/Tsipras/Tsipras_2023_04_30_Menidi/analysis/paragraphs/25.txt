Perhaps one of the most unpleasant events for Hellenism, in the four years that are passing, was the conversion of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul and the Hagia Sophia of Trebizond into Islamic mosques. It was a dark moment, not only for the Greek, but especially for the world's cultural heritage.We therefore pledge to intensify our efforts at the international and bilateral level, at the diplomatic level. For the protection of the Byzantine monuments in Turkey, which constitute a world cultural heritage.
