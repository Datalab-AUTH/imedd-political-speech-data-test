We are here today to honour the history of the Pontic Hellenism and its great contribution to the course of our country and the history of our country. We are here today to give a clear message that this history of the Pontian Hellenism is not about the past, but about the present and especially the future of our country. It is about our education, it is about our culture, it is about our citizens' housing and insurance rights, it is about our diplomatic relations.  It is, in short, about our identity.
