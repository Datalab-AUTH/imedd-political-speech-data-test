Of course, we all know the tragic continuation of this brilliant story. In a devastating period with millions of dead, marked by the rise of the Young Turks in 1908, the First World War, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the Great Powers' conflicts over the region, the claim of political self-determination by Hellenism and, as it turned out, the destructive and delusional hopes created around the Asia Minor campaign. And above all, the genocide suffered by Hellenism and other non-Muslim populations, such as the Assyrians, whose representative we have with us today, by the Ottoman and Turkish states from 1914 to 1923.
