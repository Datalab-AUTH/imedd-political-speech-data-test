And this is not, if you like, a matter of a party objective. This is a need. It is a social, economic, cultural, national need, I would say. Because it is not justice all that we have been experiencing for four years. It is not justice the enormous redistribution of wealth that has taken place in the last few years in the most provocative way. It is not justice that families are being wiped out by auctions for debts of a few thousand euros, while the party that passes these laws on the removal of protection for first homes and the bankruptcy law owes 400 million to the banks, both borrowed and unpaid. It is not justice for the prices of electricity, fuel and supermarkets. A few businesses, a few "day labourers" are making millions, billions and people can't make ends meet. It is not justice for the vast majority of the middle class to live on vouchers and for some 'day labourers' to profit.
