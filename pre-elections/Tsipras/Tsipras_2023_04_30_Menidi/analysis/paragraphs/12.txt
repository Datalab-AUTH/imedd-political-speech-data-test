As the beautiful lyric that has become a song says, "I am a Greek in foreign countries, but a foreigner in Greece". You know everything very well, because you and your parents have lived it all, you have lived it all under your own skin. But despite the suffering you have lived and experienced, you have not given up because of the disdain you have received. Not only did you survive, but you contributed decisively to the economic, political, cultural and spiritual development of our country.
