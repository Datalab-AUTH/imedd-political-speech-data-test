Friends, it is unacceptable, after such an economic crisis as the one we have experienced, and after all the difficulties of the pandemic and the crisis of poverty that you are experiencing, to be faced with payment orders for the confiscation of your houses, which were built with guarantees from the Greek State. It is unacceptable for loans and for 30 000, 40 000 that are outstanding, or even less, for loans of 30 000, 40 000 and EUR 5 000, 10 000 remaining, to be faced with seizures. Foreclosures from banks, now from funds for the houses that most of you built with your own hands, with your own work, with your own effort, with the help of your neighbours and with so many difficulties and today you are among the 700,000 of our fellow citizens who are threatened because their mortgages, with their first home, have gone into the hands of funds.
