So I want to thank you very much for your presence. And I would like you to remember from the 22nd and onwards the commitments I made before you today for the Pontian Hellenism, the commitments I made for the returning Greeks of Pontus. Commitments that we will put into practice, with a progressive majority, from the 22nd. Good power! Thank you very much for your warm presence and welcome here. Goodbye!
