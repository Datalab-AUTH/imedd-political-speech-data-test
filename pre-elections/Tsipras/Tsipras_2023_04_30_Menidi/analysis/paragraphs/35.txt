Thousands of children who participated in the National Resistance, in the democratic struggles, in the anti-dictatorship movement, Pontian Hellenism and the Pontians in our land have always been, like all refugees, the heart of the democratic party. And as the heart of the democratic party of the country, I call on you to join us all in the struggle! To raise the sun over our country again! To fight together to restore justice, to fight together for the great change that the country needs on May 21! To bring the change that society needs! To bring back justice!
