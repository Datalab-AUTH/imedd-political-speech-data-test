Because the generations to come will only be safe when we can address the causes of genocide, ethnic cleansing and conflict, so that we never again have refugees and migrants fleeing their homes in the Middle East because of the conflicts there and the destructive policies of the West. And let us not have wars in Europe, in Ukraine today, with thousands of Ukrainians of Greek origin leaving the historic city of Mariupol, which is historic for Hellenism, as happened after the bloody Russian invasion. We must therefore put forward a common, national road map for Pontian Hellenism. Because justice everywhere means justice for Pontian Hellenism, justice for our fellow Pontians.
