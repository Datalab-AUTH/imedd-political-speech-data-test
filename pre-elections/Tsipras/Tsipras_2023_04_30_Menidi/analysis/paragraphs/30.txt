It is unacceptable, in May of 20, with the economy still frozen by the lockdown, if you remember, for Mr Mitsotakis to pass a decree saying that anyone of the returnees who has a problem in repaying the mortgage loan must either join the bankruptcy system or pay the 120 instalments. As if the returnees who have gone through all this to come to Greece at the invitation of the state and with the commitment of the state to guarantee the loans for their housing are not a special case. It is not a special case for the repatriates, only the loans of Mr Mitsotakis's party, the 400 million, the loans and the unsecured loans, only that is a special case.
