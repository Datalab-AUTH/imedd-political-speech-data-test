So we are addressing all citizens and we are telling them that these elections are crucial for their daily lives. We are not only asking for a change of government, we are asking and seeking to bring change in the lives of citizens, in the everyday life of citizens and we submitted the day before yesterday an 11 article contract, which we call to sign together on May 21. We and the democratic progressive citizens, the Greek people, so that everyone knows when they vote for Syriza on May 21 what they are voting for. What exactly they are voting for, and it will be the basis on which we will call on progressive forces to form a government of progressive cooperation the day after the elections, because this country must be governed with stability by a long-term government, but one that will change people's lives and everyday life.
