The truth is that not only me, but any TV interview with journalists who don't give him prepared questions, he doesn't go scared. Let him be, let him do what he thinks the Greek people have drawn their conclusions, I will wait for him there and I will wait for him there and let him not come. But he will certainly come to the meeting on 21 May, whether he wants to or not. It is the Greek citizens who vote, not the parrots, not the pollsters, it is the Greek citizens who vote, and there we will see at the end of the day what the response of the Greek people will be. So I would like to invite you. In the three weeks that are left, less all these days, we should not lose a moment to meet with the people, to talk to the people, to present our programme, our arguments and to have the optimism that we can build a Greece that we deserve.
