So I want to commit to you today, citizens of Preveza, to commit before you that these 11 articles of our contract will be put into practice. Because now we know, now we can, now we can? Yes, we can, we are no longer under the memoranda. Imagine citizens of Preveza, we governed with the obligation. To bring 40 billion into the public coffers to bring the country to the markets. To bail out the future of our children who left it muddy. Those who bankrupted us. Imagine if we had the opportunity, like these people here who are in power and have found everything ready to spend 50 billion instead of bringing 40 into the public coffers, we would have the situation we have today. Would that money have gone to day labourers and direct commissions without us knowing where it went? We would not have built public hospitals, strong with dignity for people to have care regardless of their income. We would not have supported small and medium sized business. We would not have supported young people with the problem of the housing crisis. We would not have had schools with teachers, with books on time, we would have had them and you know it all too well and today we have none of that because it is the choice of the Mitsotakis government to support the powerful and leave the vast majority at the mercy.
