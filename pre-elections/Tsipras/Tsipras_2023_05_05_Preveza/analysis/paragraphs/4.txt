And I say it worked and it didn't work. Because at the same time that the vast majority of households can't afford it, we see this record profitability in excess profits.We see companies, not many fifteen or so on the stock exchange, having record profitability for twenty years with over a billion each, we see energy companies saving 3.6 billion in 22 years, refineries two and a half billion in the banks, another two and a half billion in the banks, another over 10 billion. The excess profits in 2022. At a time when the vast majority of households can't afford it. And what is Mr Mitsotakis doing to address this situation. Not only does he not tax the excess profits, but he keeps the value added tax the excise tax high with indirect taxes in order to plunder the income of the middle class and the weak to fill the public coffers with super revenues to give some allowances with which he asks us to pay for electricity, supermarket, gasoline. He promised 19 that he would support the middle class, and that is what he has done to the middle class. To live with coupons coupons for the supermarket, coupons for electricity, coupons for petrol everywhere, a You go everywhere, but in the end you go nowhere You go nowhere, you don't go with Mitsotakis's policy Because it is a policy that supports only the powerful, the cartels, the rich and not the great social majority, because it is a policy that supports only the powerful, the cartels, the rich and not the great social majority.
