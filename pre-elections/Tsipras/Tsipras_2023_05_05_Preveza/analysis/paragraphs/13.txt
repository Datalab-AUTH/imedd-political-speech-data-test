So we reply to Mr Mitsotakis, who tells us every time that our programme costs more and more, we reply that our programme costs almost half of what you have given for direct awards to day labourers all these years and our programme for the protection of the first home, rural land and commercial housing does not cost anything. It's a political decision, it's a political decision. To protect by legislation the first home, to repeal the bankruptcy law that you passed and to put a framework on the operation of the crowdfunders who want to turn middle class property into their own property for their own prey for profit. These are our commitments.
