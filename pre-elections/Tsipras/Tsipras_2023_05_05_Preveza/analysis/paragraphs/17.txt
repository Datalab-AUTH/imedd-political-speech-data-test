You are well aware that the government of the New Democracy has devalued almost every region of our country, but especially with the continent it seems. It had something more, a revanchism to say a vindictiveness, to say, I don't know, they don't like it very much. Continent. Maybe they want to get back at it for supporting and giving firsts to SYRIZA over the years. Maybe they want to take revenge for the fact that I come from this place. I do not know what the reason is. What I do know is that even at the last Development Conference in Ioannina, Mr Mitsotakis did not say a word about Preveza. Not a word about your prefecture.
