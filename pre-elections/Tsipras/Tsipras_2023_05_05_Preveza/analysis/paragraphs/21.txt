So we invite you to realize and together we all realize. That the great dilemma of the ballot box is, do we change or do we continue to sink, is every household in the country going to continue to be unable to make it through the month. Will we continue to not be able to go to the supermarket, to not be able to pay the electricity Because the salary will not be enough or will we give a breathing space with wage increases, price reductions and debt regulation will we go ahead with the plan of 700,000 auctions of the middle class housing of the professional; the professional housing and the agricultural land or will we go to sustainable regulations or will we restore justice to the country. So, therefore, all these dilemmas that I am putting to you are condensed into a substantial dilemma on 21 May. Mitsotakis, or change? SYRIZA Progressive Alliance Mitsotakis, these dilemmas.
