Are you afraid because you know that what we are saying?They resonate with Greek society and above all Greek society knows that this time SYRIZA Progressive Alliance is asking for the only chance to govern on the basis of its programme, because all the Greek people know that we governed in 15, 19 not with our own programme, but with the constraints of the Troika, when they were shouting "Yerun the hard way" and "Souble the hard way". We governed with these constraints. And we got Greece out of bankruptcy and we cleaned up their own mess and we regulated the debt and we left 37 billion in the public coffers. The only government that has been in the country since the post-war period that no one could claim that it didn't deliver the goods that it delivered chaos. We were the only government that governed with honesty and made sure that we did what was good for the country in the public interest, defying the costs, both political and in relation to the fact that we took the country out of the memoranda and left the debt and in relation to the fact that we took difficult decisions in order to defend the patriotic interest. And where are all those Macedonian gladiators of that period who have been hiding all these years, telling us that we betrayed Macedonia in order to save pensions?
