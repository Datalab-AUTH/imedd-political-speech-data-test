This is why we are addressing. To every democratic and progressive citizen. The vote has been given equal weight in Parliament for the first time in history, but the vote carries weight and what you vote for will come out the next day. This plan is for Mr Mitsotakis to take advantage of the relaxed election climate and come first, even by half a point to make the rag-tag government sit for another 4 years. There is only one way it can be thwarted by a victory for SYRIZA Progressive Alliance on Sunday May 21. Therefore, we call on progressive citizens, democratic citizens to realize that only a SYRIZA victory can pave the way for change and the formation of a progressive government on the next election day. And of course we invite you to reflect. On the evening of May 21, there are 2 possible outcomes. SYRIZA's premiership that will bring change or the premiership of the new democracy. So who do we want to celebrate on election night? The cartels, the interests, the powerful, the day laborers or do we want the people to celebrate, to go out on the street, to celebrate all democratic, progressive citizens, because a day of hope will open for the country.
