Precisely because this slogan to get rid of the worst right-wing government that has ruled since the post-war period is the feeling of the vast majority of people regardless of what they voted for in previous elections. And we're not just appealing to the left and progressives. We are addressing all Greeks, centre left, centre right, and we are saying to them what you feel, that is, that this terrible widening of inequalities, this daily pain of not even being able to go to the supermarket, of not being able to pay the electricity bills, of not being able to fill the car's tank with petrol, this daily pain has to stop.
