We do not deserve this Greece of corruption, inequalities, injustice. We can bring equality, justice, democracy to power. For the young children, for the middle class, for the weak, for the hard-working people, for the people of cultural creativity, to create a better tomorrow for our country, we deserve it and we can do it. You can do it with your vote and with your presence in the coming days to pave the way for the great change that our country needs. Be well, good strength, good power, good struggles and with victory.
