Not just strong, but we're going full steam ahead these two weeks to bring big change and big victory to the ballot box. A little while ago, half an hour ago. Just before I came to talk to you. My phone rang. It was Poppy Tsapanidou. She informed me. That the Mega television station had sent an invitation to me and Mr Mitsotakis the week after next for the two of us to go there for a debate to inform the Greek people about the positions of the parties that are contesting the primacy. Do you think I should go? What do you think he'll come? He's not coming because he's not coming, guys? He won't come, he won't come because he's really scared. Anyone who is afraid cannot claim the vote of the Greek people, anyone who has no arguments cannot claim the vote of the Greek people. The time of crisis is coming, Mr Mitsotakis, I invite you to come to a personal confrontation, while you are now being invited to a debate by television stations, how can you refuse? Why do you refuse what are you afraid of? What do you have to fear, you who are racing to victory? Listen to me. Come on. In a debate otherwise. Believe me, you will not be glorified by hiding, no one in this place was glorified by hiding.
