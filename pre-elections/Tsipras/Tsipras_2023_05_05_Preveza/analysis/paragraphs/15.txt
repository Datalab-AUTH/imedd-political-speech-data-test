622 million I was reading yesterday on the European website EUR Coast the first 622 million in loans this Recovery Fund have gone. Where do you think it went to 13 companies of the deep rich, who apparently have the ability to borrow from our country's banks. But they are getting low interest from the Recovery Fund in order to refinance their loans at a higher interest rate than the Greek banks, to make a profit and the vast majority 96% of small and medium enterprises in our country cannot even get out of the banks, because the banks only lend to those who can prove that they do not need to borrow. That is the reality. These are the great inequalities, and these are the great inequalities that we want to break, so we say and we say again that the National Bank should become the public pillar of the financial system, that we should use the money of the Greek taxpayers, that the National Bank should become the National Bank to give loans to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs so that they can do business.
