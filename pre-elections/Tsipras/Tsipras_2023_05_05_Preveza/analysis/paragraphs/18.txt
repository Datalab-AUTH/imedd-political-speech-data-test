Under difficult, very difficult circumstances, we tried to do things in the place.We established a Local Health Unit, we staffed the health centres, we built an ambulance service in Mesopotamos, going to Parga, where today the ambulance service operates with only one shift, which is. We completed the reconstruction of the swimming pool in Preveza, a constant source of insecurity for the residents. They reconstructed the harbour shelters. We completed the indoor gym in Kanalaki. We watered the whole area from the canal to the sandy beach, because a holiday tourist area has no water, it cannot have a perspective. But we did do substantial works.But we did do works on the roads, too. We found Ionia Street and Olympia Street finished. Why didn't the excellent technocrats, the technocrats, have a falling out with the contractors over kickbacks? That was the truth and we who were not excellent, who were not technocrats, completed the roads and put Western Greece on the map. Of course we found something else then. We found the interconnection of Preveza in the drawers. Why do I have to say this? Preveza is the only law that does not have a connection with its ionia, because we found the study on the interconnection of Preveza with the Ionian Way in the drawers and we funded to get the studies out of the drawers so that they could be redone. It has been frozen for 4 years now because there is this vindictiveness on the part of the New Democracy government. I am sure that you will give them the answer they deserve. On the 21st of this month I am sure of it.
