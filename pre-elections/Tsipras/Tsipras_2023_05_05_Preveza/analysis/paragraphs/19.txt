But I want to tell you. Two more words about this election? These elections are the first elections with simple proportional representation. But that does not mean that they are elections where simple logic does not apply. It does not mean that in these elections we are not voting on who will govern us. And it is certain that the party that comes first will be able to form the government. Don't listen to what they tell you. They talk as if it's a given that we're going to have a by-election. There are no by-elections. Mitsotakis has revealed his plans, perhaps unintentionally, the day before yesterday, Mr Skertsos said, he will use the exploratory mandate. And I'll sign it to you if he's even half a point ahead, he will do everything in his power not to risk a by-election, to make the government either by blackmail or by pressure or by plans to defect. They know well of these they have the knowhow. They will try to make a rag-tag government from the first Sunday there will be no second
