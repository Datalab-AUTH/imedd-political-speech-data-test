And what do we see these days, what do we see and what do we read? The great redistribution of income has been done through high VAT and the various subsidies that they give to consumers to pay the companies to keep prices high. What comes after May 21. Would it come if it didn't come that the big political change would come about can you be sure of that? What they had planned and had in the works. It's also a major redistribution of property. They testify and they testify themselves hey read the front page of the news today what does it say? Mitsotakis at one point presented a programme that would supposedly solve the big issue of the country's housing crisis. The fact that young people can't have their own tells young couples what to do about having a family. We see children staying until they are 35. A way of saying e until 35 in the parental home and this comes to give an explanation for the country's dramatic problem which is demographics, that the country is getting older. He supposedly put together a program a year ago. Our home program. That's kind of what he said. How did they respond, how many applied, just 20,000 applied because they didn't meet the criteria and how did 1300 get approved and what does the newspaper say today the new 1300 Only because there are no homes, it says, there are no homes and how are we going to find homes. How do they think they are going to deal with the problem from the 700,000 mortgages that have gone through the banks, the funds and the tsunami of foreclosures to come? The next day, if Mr Mitsotakis is re-elected Prime Minister, this is his plan.
