I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm, human welcome here in Preveza. For your presence here. Fellow citizens of Preveza, it is a great pleasure to be here with you. It is a great pleasure to see this passion, this optimism, this faith. Today at noon in Arta, now in Preveza, wherever I go, wherever I am these days, I am not looking for people to greet me. The streets are full, the squares are full, they are full of optimism. They are filled with self-confidence. Others are looking for people to greet them.
