So we have.I want to dedicate this slogan to the friends of the other progressive forces in the country and tell them that if there is one legacy of our people's struggles and conquests for change for democracy, it is to remember that our enemy is not the other progressive forces. Our enemy is one of Mr Mitsotakis' right-wing. He is our enemy. He is our opponent.
