And what do they say? These 11 articles of our contract, the 11 articles of our contract say above all this fourfold. Many times in my meetings I say so that we can easily understand what SYRIZA will bring the next day? Wage increases, price reductions, debt regulation and a just strong welfare state, an effective state next to the citizen. We invite, we invite all citizens to study our proposals; we invite the progressive forces to take a stand on this programme and tell us where they disagree; Mr Mitsotakis is trying to discredit it. Every time we hear a proposal that wants to support society, we are told one thing: where will you find the money, eh? They cost up our programme three times over, supposedly to prove that it is unrealistic. But who, E they cost it 3 times over 4 years, 3 times over 4 years and instead of telling the truth that it costs 4 years? EUR 22 billion, five and a half million a year it costs, they said it costs 80. Once they told us 25 then they said 45 then they said 45 then 85 with 70 they have also lost count, but I wonder, you atheophobes, one year you gave 50 billion in subsidies to day labourers subsidies that did not work and you are afraid that we will give 80 in four years?
