As well as our commitment. It is to support, as I said before, public health and public education. I see and I know very well what you are pulling here in Preveza with the public hospital and I know very well because in difficult conditions of fiscal surveillance we fought a tough battle, we took over a public hospital here with 29 doctors we handed over 45 and today while we had 5 surgeons, the surgical clinic is not working, nor the pathology, despite the fact that we went through covid and that in the period of the pandemic we all supposed. Do you remember when they hypocritically applauded the Doctors and nurses on the balconies, where is that applause? What happened to those applause left the Doctors and Nurses at their mercy Not only did they not support, they went ahead and privatised the NHS. So our commitment, our obligation and our moral obligation is to rebuild the national health system, to give. to motivate young doctors to stay in the country, to come and join the national health system, to make permanent those who fought the battle of the pandemic on the front line, risking their lives, then doctors and nursing staff, auxiliary doctors and nursing staff, and to use the resources of the Recovery Fund to build public hospitals, not to finance the powerful few that Mr Mitsotakis's government is financing.
