And of course, if some people have forgotten what our Right means, they have reminded us with their policies over these four years. They reminded us with their policies we left the public debt big but regulated 356 billion amount is regulated today? 406 billion. The Mitsotakis government increased the public debt by 50 billion, the private debt by 40 billion and increased the current account balance tenfold, the trade balance, that is, our exports are much less, 10 times less than imports than in 2019. These are the successes of the Mitsotakis government.
