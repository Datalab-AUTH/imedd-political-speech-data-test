But I was talking about health. And for Preveza. It is our commitment to look at the issue of the hospital in Preveza. It is the oldest hospital building in the country, and it is our commitment to move forward with the studies and to use resources from the Recovery Fund for a new modern hospital in Preveza. Because the county needs a new modern hospital.
